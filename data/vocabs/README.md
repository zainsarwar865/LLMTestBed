## Grammatical Perturbation Budget

Unlike many other forms of data, natural language functions under clear syntactic rules regardless of semantic content. 
Using this knowledge, we modified our approach to perturbation budgets. 
Rather than focus on embedding space L_p boundaries, we constructed a set of tokens that serve a particular grammatical function.
In particular, these tokens are nouns and conjunctions that can be used to start sentences.

Our grammatical perturbation budget has the added benefit of not requiring post-processing to reduce detectability.
