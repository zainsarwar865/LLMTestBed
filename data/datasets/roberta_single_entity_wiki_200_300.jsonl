Meurice was born and died in Paris.  In 1836, aged eighteen, he was introduced to Hugo by his friend Auguste Vacquerie, and soon became a devoted follower.  He had literary ambitions and embarked on a career as playwright.  In 1848, Hugo made him the editor-in-chief of a journal he had just founded, called L'Evenement.  (This resulted in Meurice's imprisonment in 1851, during Hugo's exile. ) Their friendship was very deep: the poet was a witness at Meurice's marriage to Palmyre Granger, daughter of the painter Jean-Pierre Granger.  During the twenty years of Hugo's exile, Meurice looked after the financial and literary interests of the proscribed writer.  He meanwhile continued his own literary career, publishing novels, some in collaboration with Alexandre Dumas, for whom he would also ghost-write.  He adapted Notre-Dame de Paris, Les Miserables and Quatre-Vingt-Treize for the stage.  With Vacquerie, and Victor Hugo's son Charles, Meurice founded the journal Le Rappel in 1869.  On Hugo's death in 1885, Meurice and Vacquerie were made executors of his estate.  In this capacity, Meurice compiled some posthumous collections of Hugo's poems.  He established the Maison de Victor Hugo in Paris in 1902.

Souvenirs intimes >>, La Revue de Paris, mai-juin 1906, p.  61-96.  Texte en ligne (in French)", "article_1": "French actor Not to be confused with Paul Meurice Paul Meurisse ( French pronunciation:   [pol moRis]; 21 December 1912 - 19 January 1979) was a French actor who appeared in over 60 films and many stage productions.  Meurisse was noted for the elegance of his acting style, and for his versatility.  He was equally able to play comedic and serious dramatic roles.  His screen roles ranged from the droll and drily humorous to the menacing and disturbing.  His most celebrated role was that of the sadistic and vindictive headmaster in the 1955 film Les Diaboliques. Meurisse was born in Dunkirk, on the north-east coast of France.  He grew up on the island of Corsica, to where his bank manager father had been transferred when Meurisse was a small child.  After leaving school, Meurisse moved to Aix-en-Provence, where he became a solicitor's clerk.  But his passion was for the stage, and he acquired evening work in the chorus of music hall revues.  In 1936, Meurisse moved to Paris, where he found work in musical theatres and nightclubs, and appeared with performers such as Marie Dubas.  He specialised in taking cheerful, upbeat songs and singing them in a comically downbeat, lugubrious fashion.  In 1939, Meurisse met singer Edith Piaf, and the two became lovers for two years.  Piaf, however, did not see a future for Meurisse as a singer, and encouraged him to try acting instead. Meurisse first performed in film in Vingt-quatre heures de perm, which was filmed in 1940 but not released until 1945.  Ne bougez plus (1941) was the first of his films to be released.  Thereafter he was in steady demand as an actor (in 1948, for example, he was credited in seven films).  Meurisse played a wide range of roles, from gangsters (Macadam, Impasse des Deux-Anges) and policemen (Inspecteur Sergil, Le Dessous des cartes), to comedy (the Monocle films) and historical (La Castiglione, L'Affaire des poisons).  The quality of the films was varied, but Meurisse's versatility brought him recognition, with his performance often considered the best part of an otherwise mediocre effort. Meurisse's most famous role was that of Michel Delasalle in Henri-Georges Clouzot's 1955 thriller Les Diaboliques, with Simone Signoret and Vera Clouzot.  In a thoroughly unsympathetic part, Meurisse was compelling.  The film, with its dark, claustrophobic atmosphere and celebrated twist ending, became an international success.  It was among the earliest foreign-language films to be widely distributed in English-speaking markets and is the film for which Meurisse is best known. Other of his notable films include Julien Duvivier's inquisitorial and oppressive Marie-Octobre (1959), Jean Renoir's Le Dejeuner sur l'herbe (1959), Clouzot's courtroom drama La Verite (1960) and Melville's crime thriller Le deuxieme souffle (1966).  Meurisse made three appearances as Commandant Theobald Dromard, aka \"The Monocle\", in the Eurospy comedies Le monocle noir (1961), L'oeil du monocle (1962), and Le monocle rit jaune (1964).  The 1969 film L'Armee des ombres, in which Meurisse had a leading role, was released in 2006 on DVD, under the title Army of Shadows, in the UK and US, to critical acclaim. Meurisse appeared in many stage productions, in plays by both contemporary French authors such as Marcel Achard and Jean Anouilh to classical English playwrights Shakespeare and George Bernard Shaw.  In the mid-1950s he was a societaire of the Comedie-Francaise. His grave.  Meurisse married three times: to Michele Alfa (1942, divorced); Micheline Cheirel (1951, divorced; she was previously married to British actor John Loder); and Micheline Gary (1960 to his death). Meurisse suffered from asthma for much of his life.  He was taken ill following a performance at the Theatre Hebertot in Paris.  He died at age 66 on 19 January 1979 of an asthma-related heart attack.", "article_2": "The E2 plot of the \"Paul Meurice\" development sector is the final stage in the redevelopment of the \"Porte des Lilas\" district in the 20th arrondissement of Paris.  25 social housing units are spread over two buildings separated by a central garden.  The nursery is located on the last two floors of Building B and offers children a roof garden.  The entire operation will be certified E3C2 (label E+C-) and BEE+ Paris.  This means that the building has a very high energy efficiency and a low carbon footprint throughout its entire life cycle.  Transsolar's work has focused on 3 simultaneous objectives: increasing thermal comfort, maximizing visual comfort and reducing the overall carbon footprint of the building under construction and operation.  The two buildings have a wooden framework allowing high future flexibility and a Porotherm brick cladding, a material with a 4 times higher thermal resistance than current masonry and a Global Warming Potential up to 2 times lower than an equivalent concrete wall.  The floors in Building A are made of wood (CLT), those in Building B of concrete and include floor heating systems in the nursery.  The quantities of concrete have been reduced as much as possible, especially for the foundations and superstructure.  Detailed Life Cycle Analyses were carried out from the beginning of the design phases in order to validate these structural choices and thus minimise the carbon footprint of the construction materials, while providing the required comfort, especially for the nursery where thermal mass (concrete slab) was necessary to achieve summer comfort.  These structural choices, combined with low carbon finishing materials (wooden frame, wooden doors, etc. ) and energy supply via a wood-pellet furnace, enable the whole program to reach level C2 of the E+C label.  The windows are double-glazed with low solar factor and have adjustable external blinds.  Combined with night ventilation - natural for the apartments and mechanical over-ventilation for the nursery - these strategies ensure that summer comfort is reached in all areas of the program.  Thus, the most unfavourable apartment has less than 40 hours with an operative temperature above 28degC, and less than 20 hours for the most unfavourable nursery space.  In terms of light comfort, the Daylight Factor (DF) is above 2% for more than 80% of the nursery spaces and the average DF is above 2% for all living areas of the apartments, making apartment and nursery spaces with excellent daylight access.  Apartments have humidity sensitive single-flow ventilation and the nursery a double-flow mechanical ventilation with heat recovery, thereby limiting the heating needs in this space requiring huge fresh air volumes.  The heating needs are less than 15 kWh/m2/a over the whole operation.  These low heating needs combined with a wood-pellet furnace heat supply, as well as 38 m2 of photovoltaic panels (~6kWp) on the roof of Building A producing renewable electricity, enable the operation to reach the E3 level of the E+C label. ", "article_3": "The most ambitious objective of the ZAC (zone damenagement concerte, a French legal definition for a specific development zone) in the Porte des Lilas area, located in north-east Paris, is to modify the relationship between Paris, encircled by its beltway, the Boulevard Peripherique and the incorporated suburbs situated immediately outside this beltway.  It is not a question of effacing the presence of this infrastructure, which is so important in the life of the Parisian agglomeration.  It is a matter of giving it a new identity, of transforming it into a passing phase in which one can discover the evolution of the city.  It is not a matter of denying the particular natures of two urban fragments built in two different eras, but rather of blurring overly-strident contrasts.  The site destined to house the project which was the object of this competition is ideally constituted and positioned, and fits perfectly into the logic of the ZAC as we interpret it.  The site is situated towards the southern limit of the development zone, in continuity with the green spaces of the Quartier Fougeres, which opens new perspectives on Bagnolet; in continuity with the system of sports installations and public areas; and also in a position of extreme visibility from the Peripherique.  We have at our disposition a free space on the slab covering the Boulevard Peripherique, and a building site to be built with a dense and important program.  The project comprises a Sports Center, a Youth Center a Pedagogical-Psychological Counselling Centre, and sports courts on the slab covering the Boulevard Peripherique.  Our approach was therefore to exploit these advantages to their maximum potential, and to develop our project following three major directions: First direction : Profiting from the free space.  This is a rare occasion in such a dense context.  And also a possibility offered for best inserting the complex within the landscape system of the ZAC, from the Plaine Saint-Denis zone to the Bagnolet area.  We therefore immediately decided to structure our project in such a manner as to not occupy the slab with the two sports pitches as foreseen in the program, but to preserve a part for the realization of a park - a filtering space, a pause, and a visual surprise in the visual context of the Peripherique.  Second direction: Imagining a system that guarantees the continuity between the neighborhood and its services.  In locating the gym-nasium underground, we created a quite permeable entry hall on the street level, and on the first floor, a sports space in direct continuity with the slab over the beltway level; the second sports terrain, which was foreseen on the slab, is located here.  Third direction: Conceiving a building with a compact and unitary image, which maintains the autonomy of its functions.  At the neighborhood level, the user clearly perceives the three programs, and easily finds their access; he also sees an ensemble where the volumes of the gymnasium, the Youth Center and the Center for Psychological Adaptation alternate with these luminous patios filled with vegetation, which animate the route along the facade.  At the scale of the city, and especially in its relationship with the ZAC and the Peripherique, the three programs blend seamlessly.  This building, which appears as a pure object from the exterior, is, on the inside, a living system where we wanted to put into place a plan of visual relationships both rich and varied, while giving each activity occurring within its proper due and allowing for their respective needs for intimacy.  The gymnasium hall is at the heart of the project.  It creates a relationship between the bank of vegetation, the sports pitches and the garden area on the artificial slab to one side, and, on the other side, the large entry hall and rock-climbing wall, opened up by the large bay windows on the room.  The goal is to create a positive atmosphere, where one can appreciate the energy of the sports practice, while being protected from acoustic disturbances and possible negative visual interferences that could distract or prove tiresome.  The colors and the interior finishings of the room contribute to the definition of this ambience.

More Specs Less Specs Text description provided by the architects.  The Paul Meurice home for disabled adults poses the question of the balance between mastering intimacy and opening to the outside world.  We respond carefully through spaces that can be widely appropriated and a variety of architectural situations.  We have imagined a south-facing, stepped building that allows light into the inner courtyard and whose volumes stretch out, recede, and produce sliding variations in the grid of staggered windows.  The facades open generously out towards the city, through large domestic windows for the apartments, and large urban windows for the common areas.  The generosity of the spaces relies upon the legibility and continuity of the common areas.  The successive tiers of the building, induced by its stepped volume, were designed as \"open-air rooms\": terraces surrounded by facades so that residents can enjoy outdoor spaces without the risk of falling.  The final level opens onto a vast, panoramic collective terrace.  The building is organized around two circulation cores, the primary core is situated in the north and a secondary, in the south.  This functional arrangement responds as much to a need for flexibility of use as to security constraints.  A large entrance hall and the day reception centre are located on the ground floor, with access to the garden, while the first floor hosts a restaurant, rooms for activities offered to residents, and spaces dedicated to administration.  The accommodation units form groups of two levels situated on the second and third floors and on the fourth and fifth floors.  No apartment is mono-oriented north and the services are installed back-to-back with the adjoining building to the North-East.  The structure is load-bearing between the facade and the circulation cores, which facilitates the modification of interior divisions.  A large elevator, like a moving room, connects the entire program by opening onto a living room on each floor.  The choice of materials contributes to the domestic atmosphere desired for the centre.  The building envelope, consisting of an externally insulated concrete wall lined with solid bricks, is particularly efficient and robust.  The aluminium windows offer resistant materiality and an anodized colour in harmony with the grey brick.  Glazed guardrails integrated into the window frames allow for the incorporation of external textile blinds guided over the entire window height.  An interior sheer curtain completes the window design. "}}

Harold Nicolson, in \"Curzon The Last Phase 1919-1921,\" wrote, in his biographical footnote on Loucheur, \"one of the most reasonable and intelligent of French post-war experts; not a politician. Coming from a background in the arms industry, Loucheur became Minister of Armaments in September 1917. He was administrator of Trefileries et Laminoirs du Havre (TLH) when he was appointed Minister of Armaments. He replaced Albert Thomas and served as armaments minister until 26 November, 1918 when he became Minister of Industrial Re-construction where he remained until 20 January, 1920.  He was the principal economic advisor for Georges Clemenceau at the 1919 Paris Peace Conference.  The product of this conference was the controversial Treaty of Versailles.  He was Minister of Liberated Regions from 16 January 1921 to 15 January 1922 in the 7th cabinet of Aristide Briand.  Loucheur was briefly Minister of Commerce, Industry, Posts, and Telegraphs under Raymond Poincare in 1924.  He also served as Minister of Finance in Briand's seventh Government during 1925 and 1926.  In Edouard Herriot's Second Ministry Loucheur served as Minister of Commerce and Industry and from June 1928 to February 1930.  He succeeded Maurice Bokanowski, who had died in an air accident.  He then served again under Poincare as Minister of Labour, Hygiene, Welfare Work, and Social Security Provisions.", "article_1": "Early career | Louis Loucheur (1872-1931) was born in the industrial city of Roubaix in northern France and completed his education at the prestigious Ecole Polytechnique in Paris.  He started his professional career as a construction engineer in the railway company Chemins de Fer du Nord, but in 1899, he founded his own construction enterprise, which in 1908 was transformed into the Societe Generale dEntreprises (SGE).  It carried out large infrastructural projects both in France and abroad.  Wartime Responsibilities | When the war broke out, Loucheur first served for several months as an artillery lieutenant.  However, he soon returned to civilian life and started producing the munitions that the French army so desperately needed.  With great success, he built up factories for the production of shells, gunpowder, and later, asphyxiating gas in Lyon, Paris, and other places.  In December 1916, thanks to his many contacts among members of the government, Loucheur became undersecretary of state for artillery and munitions in the newly formed Armament Ministry, now led by the socialist Albert Thomas (1878-1932).  When Thomas left the government in September 1917, Loucheur succeeded him as armaments minister, a post he kept until the end of the war.  Especially under Georges Clemenceau (1841-1929), with whom he built a close working relationship, Loucheur was part of the inner circle of governmental power.  Loucheur was a new type of politician, a technocrat and self-made man who had no earlier party affiliation and whose only political capital was his success in business and his extraordinary organizational skills.  When he took over the Arms Ministry, Loucheur basically maintained the state interventionsm initiated by his socialist predecessor.  During his time in office, he further centralized the responsibility for the French arms production in his ministry: the production and distribution of raw materials, the administration of labour (marked by growing unrest in 1917/18), and the production of munitions and weapons (including tanks and aircraft).  His overall record was positive.  Despite difficult circumstances, the production of munitions and weapons remained on a high level until the end of the war, even if - as his political opponents in press and parliament often complained - Loucheur did not always reach the extremely ambitious figures he had promised.  After the War | After the war, when the Armaments Ministry was transformed into the Ministry of Industrial Reconstruction, Loucheur remained in office and favored an end to the wartime state interventionism (etatisme) and a return to prewar liberalism.  In 1919, he was the leading economic advisor to the French delegation at the Versailles Peace Conference.  If he shared Clemenceaus position regarding security guarantees and reparations, he was nevertheless aware that in the long term, economic cooperation with Germany would be unavoidable.  Reconstruction and economic cooperation in Europe continued to be the most important issue in Loucheurs political activities during the 1920s, when he served several times as minister in various governments and played a major role in the French Chambre des deputes.  He now became closely associated with Aristide Briands (1862-1932) European policy and today can be considered to be one of the spiritual fathers of Europes economic unification.  On 22 November 1931, Loucheur died of a heart attack.

Firmin Didot was born in Paris into a family of printers founded by Francois Didot, the father of 11 children.  Firmin was one of his grandchildren.  The family's paper manufactory was located at Essonnes, a town c.  30 km southeast of Paris near Corbeil, which had notable paper factories. Didot invented the word \"stereotype\", which in printing refers to the metal printing plate created for the actual printing of pages (as opposed to printing pages directly with movable type), and used the process extensively, revolutionizing the book trade by his cheap editions.  His manufactory was a place of pilgrimage for the printers of the world.  He first used the process in his edition of Callets Tables of Logarithms (1795), in which he secured an accuracy till then unattainable.  He published stereotyped editions of French, English and Italian classics at a very low price. At the 1798 Exposition des produits de l'industrie francaise Pierre and Firmin Didot and Louis Etienne Herhan won an honorable distinction, the highest award, for their \"Superb edition of Virgil with characters and ink of their manufacture; a stereotype plate, and an in-12 edition of the works of Virgil and Lafontaine with these characters. \" Didot was appointed by Napoleon as the director of the Imprimerie Imperiale typefoundry. He was also the author of two tragedies -- La Reine de Portugal and La Mort dAnnibal -- and he wrote metrical translations from Virgil, Tyrtaeus and Theocritus. France is indebted to the Didot family for the publication of the Biographie Nationale, and Belgium is also indebted for the establishment of her Royal Press.  Relatives of Firmin Didot include Francois Ambroise Didot (1730-1804); Pierre Francois Didot (1732-95); Henri Didot (1765-1862); and Pierre Didot (1760-1853).  Essai sur la Typographie by a member of the Didot family was published at Paris in 1852.  Along with Giambattista Bodoni of Italy, Firmin Didot is credited with establishing the use of the Didone or \"Modern\" style of serif typefaces.

They were printers, publishers, typeface designers, inventors and intellectuals.  Around 1800 the Didot family owned the most important print shop and font foundry in France.

Born in Paris into a family of printers founded by Francois Didot, the father of 11 children, Firmin was one of his grandchildren.  2.  A dynasty of French printers, punch-cutters, and publishers, the family \"gained renown for their illustrated editions of the classics, as well as for publishing inexpensive editions of scholarly texts. \" \"The former were illustrated by some of the most respected artists of the day, providing a wide audience with access to images that had only ever been available to those privileged few who had access to royal palaces and aristocratic chateaus.  Making classic works--be they artistic, philosophical, or literary--available to a broad audience was only part of the family's influence, however.  The family's most lasting legacy is the Didot family of fonts, designed by Firmin Didot, which influences typography to this day\" writes Dana Hart, Manager for Library Administration at the Thomas J.  Watson Library for The Met.  3.  Didot invented the word \"stereotype\", which in printing refers to the metal printing plate created for the actual printing of pages (as opposed to printing pages directly with movable type), and used the process extensively, revolutionizing the book trade by his cheap editions.  4.  Didot first used the process in his edition of Callets Tables of Logarithms (1795), in which he secured an accuracy till then unattainable.  He published stereotyped editions of French, English and Italian classics at a very low price.  Three years later, at the 1798 Exposition des produits de l'industrie francaise Pierre and Firmin Didot and Louis Etienne Herhan won an honorable distinction, the highest award, for their \"Superb edition of Virgil with characters and ink of their manufacture; a stereotype plate, and an in-12 edition of the works of Virgil and Lafontaine with these characters. \" 5.  Didot was appointed by Napoleon as the director of the Imprimerie Imperiale typefoundry.  6.  A man of words and tales himself, Didot was also the author of two tragedies -- La Reine de Portugal and La Mort dAnnibal -- and he wrote metrical translations from Virgil, Tyrtaeus and Theocritus.  7.  Along with Italys Giambattista Bodoni, Firmin Didot is credited with establishing the use of the Didone or \"Modern\" style of serif typefaces.  The types that Didot used are characterized by extreme contrast in thick strokes and thin strokes, by the use of hairline serifs and by the vertical stress of the letters.  Many fonts today are available based on Firmin Didot's typefaces, and are often called Didot as a result.  8.  \"When movable type was first created, fonts were designed to look as much like the handwriting of scribes as possible.  This attempt to maintain the look and feel of manuscripts, known as Old Style, ended in the 1750s when the English printer John Baskerville designed the first Transitional typeface, known as Baskerville\" writes Hart of Didots legacy.  \"Firmin was inspired by Baskerville's typeface and took his experiments in letterform to the extreme, designing his first font in 1784.  This font, regarded as the first Modern typeface, has high contrast between thick and thin strokes, hairline serifs with no bracketing, and vertical stress in rounded strokes. \" \"Thirty years later, an Italian type designer, Giambattista Bodoni, started creating his own Modern typeface.  He also admired Baskerville, and his designs were greatly influenced by Didot.  Bodoni's letters were dramatic, with horizontal serifs and high contrast.  Viewing Baskerville, Didot, and then Bodoni alongside each other shows an important transition into Modern typography. \" \"Today, Didot's legacy can be seen in the 'modern Moderns.  Modern typefaces tend to denote luxury brands, and are often used on the covers of fashion publications such as Vogue.  Since Didot created his first typeface in the eighteenth century, many typographers have created designs inspired by the Didot type family, and these new interpretations pay tribute to the impact Didot had on the world of typography. \" 9.  Didot is a group of typefaces named after the famous French printing and type producing Didot family.  The classification is known as modern, or Didone.  The most famous Didot typefaces were developed in the period 1784-1811.  Firmin Didot (1764-1836) cut the letters, and cast them as type in Paris.  His brother, Pierre Didot (1760-1853) used the types in printing.  Didot is described as neoclassical, and evocative of the Age of Enlightenment.  The Didot family were among the first to set up a printing press in the newly independent Greece, and typefaces in the style of Didot have remained popular in Greek since.  Several revivals of the Didot faces have been made, first for hot metal typesetting and then for phototype and digital versions.  Among the most successful contemporary adaptations are the ones drawn by Adrian Frutiger for the Linotype foundry, and by Jonathan Hoefler for H&FJ.  Hoefler's design anticipates the degradation of hairline in smaller point sizes by employing heavier weighted strokes in the smaller point sizes.  Frutiger's Didot revival, which is bundled with macOS, was specifically intended for display use and not for body text, and adds in addition an even more delicate headline font.  A libre open source implementation of Didot including the Cyrillic and Greek alphabet was released under the name Theano Didot by the Russian historian Alexey Kryukov.  Alexey Brodovitch implemented the usage of Didot in Cahiers d'Art and Harper's Bazaar.  Vogue has been using Didot as the typeface for their cover title since 1955.  The \"CBS Didot\" version of Didot was commissioned and used by broadcast network CBS for many years alongside its famous \"eye\" logo.  While the network's use of Didot with its logo is not as prevalent as it once was, it is still a common sight, used mainly for the imaging of CBS News, the logo for CBS Corporation, and the logotype for The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.  It is also used as the logotype for the credits of the CBS sitcom \"Mom. \" Another note-worthy usage of Didot is in the new Zara logo that caused quite a bit of uproar for its \"uncomfortably close\" kerning.  Didot is a commonly used typeface by logo designer Baron & Baron.  10.  A survey of 368 people done by writer and typographer Sarah Hyndman suggested that bold typefaces with rounder terminals appear cheaper, whereas lighter weights, serifs, and contrasts were rated as more expensive, with the modern Didot selected as the most expensive-looking font.  \"I think cultural associations have a great deal of impact.  We see these styles used repeatedly in a similar context, which reinforces the links,\" said Hyndman of the results.  \"The delicacy of the detail is also associated with craftsmanship, skill, and quality\" she added.

After serving in the Revolutionary Wars, he earned rapid promotion while fighting against Spain and soon found himself as a division commander under Napoleon Bonaparte in Italy.  He fought in all of Bonaparte's battles of 1796 with great distinction.  During the Napoleonic Wars, Napoleon entrusted Augereau with important commands.  His life ended under a cloud because of his poor timing in switching sides between Napoleon and King Louis XVIII of France.  Napoleon wrote of Augereau that he \"has plenty of character, courage, firmness, activity; is inured to war; is well liked by the soldiery; is fortunate in his operations. \". Augereau is generally counted as one of the most capable generals of the Napoleonic Wars. Augereau was born in Faubourg Saint-Marceau, Paris, as the son of a Parisian fruit seller (in some accounts, a servant).  He enlisted in the army at the age of seventeen in the Clare Infantry Regiment, but was soon discharged.  Later, he joined the dragoons.  He became a noted swordsman and duellist, but he had to flee France after killing an officer in a quarrel.  For the next 13 years Augereau drifted across Europe.  He claimed to have served in the Russian Army against the Ottoman Empire, being present at the Siege of Izmail as a sergeant before deserting afterwards. He later enlisted in the infantry regiment of Prince Henry of Prussia and claimed he served in the Prussian Foot Guards as well.  He deserted by masterminding a mass escape and reached Saxony, where he taught fencing. In 1781, King Louis XVI of France proclaimed an amnesty for deserters, so Augereau returned to his native land.  He joined the cavalry in 1784, and after serving in the carabiniers he was sent to the Kingdom of Naples as part of a military mission.  While in Naples, he eloped with Gabrielle Grach and the two lovers traveled to Portugal where they spent the years 1788-1791.  After the French Revolution broke out, the Portuguese jailed Augereau as a dangerous foreigner.  Somehow, Gabrielle persuaded the authorities to release her husband and the couple returned to France.  In September 1792, Augereau joined a volunteer cavalry unit, the German Legion, but this is without proof as Augereau claims that the papers were taken away from him during the Portuguese Inquisition. Augereau on the bridge at Arcole, 15 November 1796 by Left:by Charles Thevenin .  Right: Portrait of Augereau with the Thevenin painting, by Johann Heinsius , between 1805-1812 Augereau's unit was sent to put down the revolt in the Vendee in April 1793.  The German Legion proved useless in battle because many of the soldiers switched sides, and the officers, including Augereau and Francois Marceau, found themselves in prison.  Released, he served briefly in the 11th Hussars before serving as wagonmaster and as aide de camp to General Jean Antoine Rossignol.  He was then assigned to train recruits for General Jean-Antoine Marbot at Toulouse.  Marbot liked his work and Augereau soon became a close friend of the Marbot family. It is not clear when, or if, Augereau was promoted to general of brigade, but he transferred to the Army of the Eastern Pyrenees and was promoted to general of division on 23 December 1793. When General Jacques Francois Dugommier became commander in January 1794, the army was thoroughly reorganized.  Augereau became a divisional commander and played a significant role at the Battle of Boulou from 29 April to 1 May, where his feint attacks lured the Spanish Army led by General Luis Firmin de la Union into a false position.  After the victory at Boulou, the army advanced a short distance into Spain, with Augereau holding the right wing.  At the Battle of San-Lorenzo de la Muga on 13 August, he skillfully repelled the assaults of 20,000 Spanish troops with his 10,000 French troops. On 17 November, Dugommier launched a major offensive against the Spanish at the Battle of the Black Mountain.  On the first day, Augereau's attack crushed the Spanish left flank while other French attacks proved unsuccessful.  Dugommier was killed on the second day, but after a day's pause, the advance resumed and the Spanish were routed.  After the Peace of Basel ended the War of the Pyrenees in July 1795, Augereau and his division were transferred to the Army of Italy.  On 23 November 1795, Augereau fought at the Battle of Loano against the Austrians and Piedmontese.  During the fighting, his troops attacked on the right near the coast, while General Andre Massena's division pierced the Allied center.  The following April, his close association with Napoleon Bonaparte began when Bonaparte took command of the army and launched the Montenotte campaign. Augereau fought at the Battle of Millesimo on 13 April 1796, and accepted the surrender of the castle of Cosseria the next morning.  He led his troops at the Battle of Ceva on the 16th, before serving in the Lodi campaign in early May and at the Battle of Borghetto on 30 May.  But it was at the Battle of Castiglione on 5 August 1796 that Augereau rendered the most notable services.  In his memoirs, General Marcellin Marbot described Augereau as encouraging even Bonaparte himself in the confused situation that prevailed before that battle, though Marbot may not be the most reliable source, as he had not witnessed these events directly and because of his outspoken sympathy for Augereau.  In any case, it was Bonaparte's undoubted superiority as a strategist that made the victory at Castiglione a possibility.  On 3 August, while Bonaparte defeated the Austrian corps of General Peter Quasdanovich, Augereau held off the main Austrian army of General Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser.  With 11,000 men, he attacked General Anton Lipthay's brigade and drove it back on the Austrian main body.  By the end of the day, Augereau faced 20,000 Austrians.  The battle cost the Austrians about 1,000 casualties, while French losses were also heavy, including General Martial Beyrand who was killed.  Augereau's bold front allowed Bonaparte to dispose of Quasdanovich, then mass his main strength to beat Wurmser at Castiglione two days later. Shortly after Castiglione, Bonaparte tersely summed up Augereau's military qualities: \"Much character, courage, steadiness, activity; is used to war, liked by the soldiers, lucky in his operations. \" In 1797, Bonaparte sent Augereau to Paris to encourage the Jacobin Directors.  Augereau and the troops led by him coerced the \"moderates\" in the councils and carried through the coup d'etat of 18 Fructidor (4 September 1797).  He was then sent to command French forces in Germany.  Augereau took little part in the coup d'etat of 18 Brumaire in November 1799, and did not distinguish himself in the Rhenish campaign which followed.  Nevertheless, owing to his final adhesion to Bonaparte's fortunes, Augereau received a Marshal's baton at the beginning of the First French Empire on 19 May 1804. Augereau, by H.  Rousseau (drawing), E.  Thomas (engraving) , by H.  Rousseau (drawing), E.  Thomas (engraving) Augereau commanded a camp in Brest, Brittany, during preparations for the invasion of Britain.  When Napoleon called off the invasion because of the growing threat from Austria and Russia, the camp became the VII Corps of the Grande Armee.  With this force, Augereau fought in the War of the Third Coalition.  His corps was charged with protecting the army's lines of communications during the Ulm campaign.  He fought in the battles of Konstanz and Bregenz, before tracking down and destroying General Franz Jellacic's Austrian division at Dornbirn in Vorarlberg on 13 November 1805.  This was followed by the occupation of Frankfurt am Main.  His wife Gabrielle died while he was away. During the War of the Fourth Coalition, Augereau was again commander of the VII Corps.  He distinguished himself at the Battle of Jena on 14 October 1806 where his corps made up the left flank.  Early in 1807, he fell ill with fever, and at the Battle of Eylau on 7 February 1807, he had to be supported on his horse.  Nevertheless, he directed the movements of his corps with his usual bravery.  Augereau's corps was almost annihilated and the marshal himself received a wound in the arm from grapeshot. Augereau became Duke of Castiglione on 19 March 1808, a hereditary victory title (i. e.  not in chief of an actual fief, but a hollow title), in honour of the 1796 victory.  In 1809, he married the 19-year-old Adelaide Josephine Bourlon de Chavange (1789 - 1869) whom he had become infatuated with. Adelaide, the daughter of Gilles Bernard Bourlon de Chavange and wife Jeanne Francoise Launuy, had no children with Augereau and the ducal title became extinct upon his death.  His wife later remarried Camille de Sainte-Aldegonde (1787 - 1853), by whom she had a daughter Valentine de Sainte-Aldegonde (1820 - 1891), who married the 3rd Duke of Dino.  While serving in Catalonia during the Peninsular War from February to May 1810, Augereau gained some successes but tarnished his name with cruelty.  During the Russian campaign in 1812 did not leave Berlin. [citation needed] It was Augereau's brother Jean-Pierre, serving under Louis Baraguey d'Hilliers, who was taken prisoner by the Russian vanguard near Smolensk. He sat out the German campaign in spring 1813 due to illness.  Before the Battle of Leipzig in October, Napoleon reproached him with not being the Augereau of Castiglione; to which he replied, \"Give me back the old soldiers of Italy, and I will show you that I am. \" Yet, he led the IX Corps at Leipzig with skill and brought off his command in good order. In 1814, Augereau was given command of the army of Lyon, and his slackness exposed him to the charge of having come to an understanding with the Allies.  Thereafter, he served the restored Bourbon King Louis XVIII of France.  But, after reviling Napoleon, he went over to him during the Hundred Days.  The emperor repulsed Augereau and charged him with being a traitor to France in 1814.  After being re-restored to the throne in 1815 following Napoleon's defeat, King Louis XVIII deprived Augereau of his military title and pension.  Augereau died at his estate of La Houssaye only a year later. He is buried in the Pere Lachaise Cemetery.

At the age of 17, Augereau, of very modest origins, enlists in the Prussian, then in the Neapolitan armies.  He settles in Naples as a fencing master.  At the time of the Revolution, he comes back to France.  Though he starts out as a private in the National Guard, five years later he is major general in the Army of Italy.  In April 1796, he takes the castle of Ceva, his first military feat under general Bonaparte's command.  He proves his bravery at Lodi, on May 10, 1796, when he charges through the Austrian hail of bullets.  On August 3, 1796, his intervention at Castiglione reverses the outcome of the battle.  At Arcola, on November 15, he rushes over the bridge at the head of his troops.  Bonaparte respects and trusts him, despite the rumors about his greed.  In September, he sends him to Paris to crush the Royalist uprising, the 18-Fructidor coup d'etat.  Augereau proves extremely efficient, carrying out all the Directory's orders to the letter; he is then named commander of a corps of the Army of the Rhine.  Augereau, deputy of Haute-Garonne at the Council of the Five Hundred, is at first opposed to the 18-Brumaire coup d'etat.  He is friendly with the Jacobins and refuses the invitation to the banquet given in honor of Bonaparte.  However, he rallies to the Consulate on the morning of 18-Brumaire, kissing Napoleon and exclaiming: \"What! You had plans for the homeland and you didn't call Augereau!\" Although he criticizes the Concordat, he nevertheless remains on the list of the 1804 marshals and he attends the Emperor's coronation.  From September 1805 to February 1807, he is in command of the 7th corps of the Grande Armee.  At the battle of Jena, on October 14, 1806, he defeats the Saxons and crushes Ruchel's corps, which had come to the Prussian army's aid.  At Eylau (February 8, 1807), he is ill, and demands to be tied to his horse at the beginning of the battle.  As he is about to attack the Russian center, his corps gets lost in a snowstorm.  The French soldiers are decimated by the enemy cannons.  Wounded in the arm, Augereau goes back to France.  On March 19, 1808, he receives the title of Duc de Castiglione.  He then serves in Spain.  His first victories at the head of the Army of Catalonia are soon followed by defeats.  The Emperor sends Augereau home, but recalls him for the 1812 Russian campaign and puts him in command of a reserve corps.  The marshal is there during the French defeat of Leipzig, on October 16-19, 1813.  His fierce defense puts him back in Napoleon's good graces.  In 1814, the Emperor puts him in command of the army corps posted in Lyon.  Augereau, whose orders are to cut off the Army of Bohemia's lines of communication, comes to an agreement and refuses the battle.  He is now a celebrity.  On April 16, 1814, he sends out a proclamation instructing his soldiers to wear the Bourbon's white cockade and denouncing Napoleon as a tyrant.  The Emperor crosses his name off the list of marshals during the Hundred Days, and calls him a \"traitor to France\" when Augereau comes to offer his services.  Once back on the throne, Louis XVIII also excludes him.  Augereau retires to his country estate, where he dies of a lung illness, without leaving any children.  In Saint Helena, Napoleon will say of him: \"He was incapable of behaving; he had no education, a narrow mind, few manners; but he maintained order and discipline amongst his soldiers, who loved him.  He knew how to divide his columns, set up his reserves; he fought boldly; but it all never lasted longer than the day: victorious or defeated, he was most often discouraged in the evening, which was due either to his disposition or to his lack of calculation and penetration. \" By Artea [ Biographies Index | Marshals Index ]", "article_3": "By Nathan D.  Jensen Born: October 21, 1757 Place of Birth: Paris, Paris, France Died: June 12, 1816 Cause of Death: Illness Place of Death: La Houssaye, France Arc de Triomphe: AUGEREAU on the south pillar The son of a fruit merchant, Charles-Pierre-Francois Augereau first joined the French military at age 17 when he enlisted in the Irish Regiment of Clare in 1774.  The next year he somehow purchased permission to leave or deserted and then joined a dragoon regiment which he remained with for two years.  Augereau next traveled to Prussia where he joined the Prussian Army, serving in the regiment of Bevern-Brunswick against the Austrians and later the Turks.  In 1784 he returned to France and joined the Bourgogne cavalry, where he served with the carabiniers.  Two years later Baron Salis sent Augereau to Naples to serve as an instructor to the Neapolitan army where he served as a fencing master.  While in Naples Augereau met and fell in love with Gabrielle Grach, and when her father refused to allow Augereau to marry his daughter, the two young lovebirds eloped and escaped to Portugal.  With the arrival of the French Revolution, Augereau and his wife felt pressure to leave Portugal and therefore returned to France in 1790.  Once back in France, he joined the Parisian National Guard and by 1792 he was serving in the German Legion.  Sent to stop the royalists in the Vendee, Augereau's unit fell apart to desertion and he was arrested and detained along with a young Lieutenant Marceau-Desgraviers.  Released in June of 1793, Augereau was then promoted to capitaine in the 11th Hussars.  A few months later he was named an aide-de-camp to General Rossignol, but he so disliked the position that within two weeks he had negotiated a transfer to the Army of the Eastern Pyrenees as a chef de brigade.  Once with the Army of the Eastern Pyrenees, Augereau put his past military experience to work, drilling and training the new recruits in efficiency and earning the nickname the \"Big Prussian\".  In December of 1793 he was promoted to general de division and a few weeks later he received command of the advance guard.  As the campaigning got underway in May of 1794, he led his men in seizing the bridge of Ceret and Saint-Laurent de la Mouga, and then defeated the Spanish there.  That August Augereau again fought at Saint-Laurent de la Mouga where he was wounded by multiple balls but nevertheless defeated the Spanish.  In November of 1794, he served at the Battle of Montagne Noire and then laid siege to Figuieres before covering the siege of Roses.  The next year Augereau commanded the right wing at the Battle of the Fluvia, and after Spain sued for peace, he and his men were transferred to the Army of Italy.  Now serving with the Army of Italy, Augereau and his men distinguished themselves at the Battle of Loano in November of 1795.  After General Bonaparte arrived to take command of the Army of Italy in March of 1796, Augereau supported him and received command of the 1st Division.  That April he served at Montenotte, Millesimo, Cossaria, and Ceva before taking command of the 2nd Division.  Augereau continued to fight, serving in May at Lodi and Peschiera and then in June at the suburbs of Mantua.  That August Augereau was given the task of delaying one of the Austrian columns sent to relieve Mantua, and he won at Castiglione before then being joined by the rest of the army two days later and distinguishing himself at the Battle of Castiglione .  In September he won at Primolano and served at Bassano before retaking Legnago.  Augereau continued to serve notably in Italy, for in November he fought at Caldiero and Arcola and then in January of 1797 he won at Anghiari and served at La Favorite.  After the success of the campaign, Napoleon gave Augereau the honor of taking sixty captured flags back to the Directory in Paris.  Over the years of campaigning he had gained quite the reputation for looting and one of the Directors called him a \"proud bandit\".  In May of 1797 Augereau returned to the Army of Italy where he took command of the area around Verona and Venice.  But by that July the Directory had grown nervous about the rise of royalists in the government, and they requested that General Bonaparte send the army to help them maintain control.  Napoleon sent General Augereau with a force in response, and that September Augereau and his men provided the military muscle for the coup of 18 Fructidor that expelled and exiled the royalists from France.  With the crisis of power now resolved, the Directory decided to send Augereau to command the Army of Germany.  His lack of discipline there upset many of the French officers under his command, and in February of 1798 his army was disbanded and sent to other units.  Augereau was then sent to command the 10th military division at Perpignan, and in April of 1799 he was elected a deputy of Haute-Garonne in the Council of Five Hundred.  When Napoleon seized power on the 18th Brumaire, Augereau initially opposed the coup but changed his mind upon realizing Napoleon's success.  Napoleon placed Augereau in charge of the French army in Holland in January of 1800.  That December he won at Burg-Eberach before a peace treaty brought an end to the hostilities.  For the next few years Augereau was largely unemployed, and he spent his time building his estate at Houssaye-en-Brie.  By this time Augereau was rich and no longer considered the looter he had once been.  When his friend General Lannes needed money, Augereau loaned him 300,000 francs without interest.  In 1803 Augereau was named commander of the camp of Bayonne, and in early 1804 he became commander of the camp of Brest.  That May he was one of the original Marshals of the Empire created by Napoleon, and the next year he received the Grand Eagle of the Legion of Honor.  When war broke out in 1805, the troops under Augereau became the VII Corps.  Significantly farther behind the other corps of the army, Augereau's corps nevertheless took part in the campaign of 1805 by protecting the rear and he chased and took Austrian General Jellachich's surrender at Feldkirch in November.  In 1806 Marshal Augereau was still in charge of VII Corps for the Prussian campaign of that year.  His wife died that August while he was away, but he had little time to grieve.  That October he and his men marched against Prussia, and on the day before the Battle of Jena his men took a number of Prussian prisoners.  Some of these prisoners belonged to his old company from his years in Prussian service, and Augereau invited his old captain and sergeant to dinner and gave them money.  The next day he commanded the left at the Battle of Jena and afterwards took part in the pursuit of the Prussian army.  That December he and his men won at Kolozomb and then fought at Golymin.  In February of 1807, Augereau fought at Ziegelhoff and then requested to be relieved of command due to an illness.  His request was denied, and he was strapped into his saddle and tied a great scarf around his head for the Battle of Eylau.  During that battle, his VII Corps advanced and a snowstorm descended upon them, causing them to lose their way and alter their path of march.  Before long the VII Corps was caught in an artillery crossfire between the French and Russian guns as everyone struggled to see friends and enemies.  VII Corps was nearly destroyed and Augereau himself was hit by a ball before his horse fell and took him down with it.  Wounded and sick, after the battle Augereau was sent back to France to recover while the remnants of his destroyed corps were distributed to other units.  In 1808 Napoleon made Augereau the Duke of Castiglione in honor of his victory there back in 1796.  That year he also met the young Adelaide-Josephine de Chavange and began a relationship, eventually marrying her in 1809.  Augereau was finally fit for some service in the Danube campaign of 1809, and he took command of the VIII Corps and protected the army's rear.  Next he was sent to the Army of Spain where he served until early 1810 when he was replaced by Marshal Macdonald.  For the Russian campaign of 1812, Augereau was again given a task of protecting the lines of communication and the rear of the Grande Armee.  He was given command of the XI Corps in Germany and remained there throughout the campaign, ensuring the lines of communication between France and Russia.  After the disastrous retreat of 1812, Augereau was named commander at Berlin in January of 1813, but in February he requested to return to France due to sickness.  A brief respite followed but he returned to duty two months later as the Governor of Frankfurt.  That June he took command of IX Corps and then in August he took command of the XVI Corps.  Summoned to battle that October, he won at Naumburg and then fought at Leipzig where he held his own.  For the defense of France of 1814, Napoleon placed Augereau in charge of the Army of the Rhone at Lyon.  However, Augereau did little during the campaign, avoiding fighting until he finally gave battle in March and was beaten at Saint-Georges and Limonest.  Following those losses, he abandoned Lyon.  After learning of Napoleon's abdication, Augereau issued a proclamation heaping abuse on Napoleon and urging his soldiers to serve the Bourbons.  The returning Bourbons named him a Knight of Saint Louis and gave him command of a military division.  When Napoleon escaped from exile in 1815, Augereau proclaimed his support of Napoleon but Napoleon had not forgotten his actions of 1814.  Napoleon struck Augereau from the list of marshals and thereafter did not pay attention to him.  After Napoleon's second abdication, the returning Bourbons dismissed Augereau from service and he died the next year.  Bibliography", "article_4": "Pierre-Francois-Charles Augereau, duke de Castiglione, (born October 21, 1757, Paris, France--died June 12, 1816, La Houssaye), army officer whose military ability won for France a series of brilliant victories in Italy under Napoleons command.  The son of a poor Parisian servant, Augereau turned to a military career at the age of 17, served in several foreign armies, and returned to France in 1792.  He quickly advanced in rank and by 1793 was general of a division stationed in the eastern Pyrenees.  In 1795 his division served in the Italian campaign, and his victory at Castiglione (August 5, 1796) convinced Napoleon of his indispensability.  He carried out the coup detat of 18 Fructidor (September 4, 1797) and was elected a deputy and secretary of the Assembly in 1799.  Augereau opposed Napoleons coup detat of 18 Brumaire (November 9, 1799) and was consequently given unimportant commands from 1800 to 1805.  Yet he was appointed a marshal of France in 1804.  In 1806 Augereau commanded a corps at the Battle of Jena.  At the Battle of Eylau (February 7-8, 1807), his corps, misdirected in a snowstorm, lost half its numbers.  Nevertheless, in 1808 Napoleon named him duc de Castiglione and gave him a new command in Catalonia, in Spain, where he was soon defeated.  Recalled to France in 1810, he was given only a minor post during Napoleons invasion of Russia in 1812.  He continued fighting in Germany the following year, but after the losses at the Battle of Leipzig (October 16-19, 1813) he returned to France.  Augereau had grown weary of the war by 1810.  After another defeat at Lyon, in 1814, he bitterly attacked Napoleon and declared himself a royalist after the First Restoration of the Bourbon monarchy (1814).  Louis XVIII rewarded Augereau for his anti-Napoleonic sentiments, and when he again offered his services to Napoleon in 1815, he was ignored.  After the Battle of Waterloo the king gave him no command, and he retired to his estate at La Houssaye. "}}

Grousset published under the pseudonyms of Andre Laurie, Philippe Daryl, Tiburce Moray and Leopold Virey. Grousset was born in Corte, Corsica, and studied medicine before commencing a journalistic career.  In 1869 he began working for the weekly newspaper La Marseillaise, writing pro-revolutionary articles.  As a result of an attempt by Grousset to challenge Pierre Napoleon Bonaparte to a duel during 1870, Grousset's second, Victor Noir, was shot and killed by Bonaparte during a quarrel.  Later the same year Grousset was sentenced to six months imprisonment.  He was elected a member of the Paris Commune, becoming a member of its executive committee and Delegate for External Affairs.  After the fall of the Commune, he was arrested and, in 1872, he was deported to New Caledonia.  He escaped, and lived in Sydney, San Francisco, New York City and London, making a living by teaching French.  He returned to France after the 1880 amnesty, becoming involved in literature and physical culture, but eventually returning to politics and, in 1893, becoming a Socialist Deputy for the 12th arrondissement of Paris.  Like Jules Verne, he was another discovery of publisher Pierre-Jules Hetzel.  He \"collaborated\" with Verne on Les Cinq Cent Millions de la Begum (1879), L'Etoile du Sud (1884) and L'Epave du Cynthia (1885).  Some scholars[who?] believe that these works were based on manuscripts written by Grousset and rewritten by Verne at Hetzel's request. One of Grousset's most notable science fiction novels was Les Exiles de la Terre - Selene-Company Limited (1887).  In it, a consortium which intends to exploit the Moons mineral resources decides that, since our satellite is too far to be reached, it must be brought closer to the Earth.  A Sudanese mountain composed of pure iron ore becomes the headquarters of the newly established Selene Company.  Solar reflectors are used to provide the energy required to convert the mountain into a huge electro-magnet, with miles of cables wrapped around it.  A spaceship-observatory is then built on top of the mountain.  When the experiment begins, the mountain is ripped away from the Earth and catapulted to the Moon.  There, the protagonists have various adventures and eventually return to Earth by re-energizing the mountain.  Other notable works by Grousset published under the Laurie pseudonym include De New York a Brest en Sept Heures [New York to Brest in Seven Hours] (1888), which predicted a transatlantic tunnel; Le Secret du Mage (The Secret of the Magician) (1890), in which evidence of an advanced prehistoric is discovered; Le Rubis du Grand Lama [The Ruby of the Great Lama] (1894), which features a steam-powered flying island; Atlantis (1895), which describes how the mythical kingdom has survived under a glass dome at the bottom of the sea near the Azores; Le Maitre de l'Abime (The Master of the Abyss) (1905), which features a revolutionary submarine, and finally Spiridon le Muet (Spiridon The Mute_) (1907), a novel about a human-sized, intelligent ant.  The character of Spiridon, depicted as a non-human alien, gifted with great knowledge, an insatiable scientific curiosity but no human feelings or emotions, the victim of mankind's petty jealousies and racial fears, is a striking departure from the Vernian influence that permeated the rest of Laurie's works.

Maine de Biran was born at Bergerac; died at Paris, 16 July, 1824.  The name Maine he assumed (some time before 1787) from an estate called Le Maine, near Mouleydier.  After studying with distinction at Perigueux, he entered the life guards of King Louis XVI of France, and was present at Versailles during the events of October 1789.  He entered politics and was part of the Conseil des Cinq Cents in April, 1797; however, as he incurred the hostility of the Directory by his royalist sympathies he withdrew to his patrimonial inheritance of Grateloup, near Bergerac, where he avoided the excesses of the French Revolution and where he devoted himself to philosophy.  It was at this period that, to use his own words, he \"passed per saltum from frivolity to philosophy\".  He began with psychology, which he made the study of his life.  After the Reign of Terror, Maine de Biran took part in politics and was elected to parliament in 1812, 1815, and 1820.  Having been excluded from the Council of the Five Hundred on suspicion of royalism, he took part with his friend Joseph Laine in the commission of 1813, which first expressed direct opposition to the will of the emperor Napoleon.  After the restoration of the monarchy, he became treasurer to the chamber of deputies, retiring during each autumn recess to study at home. His constitution was delicate and sensitive and his philosophic bent had already manifested itself by his observations on the influence of the physical state on the moral.  As an ideologist he won the prize at the Institut with his essay \"Sur l'habitude\" (1802); but his \"Decomposition de la pensee\" (1805) shows him deviating from the theory of that school, and in \"La perception immediate\" (1807), and \"Rapports du physique et du morale de l'homme\" (1811), he is an opponent of the eighteenth-century philosophy.  In his latter days his tendency to mysticism gradually brought him back towards practical Christianity, and he died a faithful child of the Catholic Church. He married twice in 1795 and 1814 and had a son Felix in 1796 and two daughters Eliza 1797 and Adine 1800 who all bore the new surname of Maine de Biran.  His son, Felix, having only daughters, the name Maine de Biran died out in 1879 before being taken over at the end of the 19th century by the natural son of a distant niece, Francoise Gontier de Biran known as Nelly, with an unknown man. Only a few of Maine de Biran's writings appeared during his lifetime: the essay on habit (Influence de l'habitude sur la faculte de penser, \"The Influence of Habit on the Faculty of Thinking\", 1802), a critical review of Pierre Laromiguiere's lectures (1817), and the philosophical portion of the article \"Leibnitz\" in the Biographie universelle (1819).  A treatise on the analysis of thought (Sur la decomposition de la pensee, \"On the Decomposition of Thought\") was never printed.  In 1834 these writings, together with the essay entitled Nouvelles considerations sur les rapports du physique et du moral de l'homme, were published by Victor Cousin, who in 1841 added three volumes, under the title OEuvres philosophiques de Maine de Biran.  But the publication (in 1859) by Edouard Naville (from manuscripts placed at his father's disposal by Biran's son) of the OEuvres inedites de Maine de Biran, in three volumes, first rendered possible a connected view of his philosophical development. At first a sensualist, like Condillac and John Locke, next an intellectualist, he finally became a mystical theosophist.  The Essai sur les fondements de la psychologie represents the second stage of his philosophy, the fragments of the Nouveaux essais d'anthropologie the third.  Maine de Biran's early essays in philosophy were written from the point of view of Locke and Condillac, but showed signs of his later interests.  Dealing with the formation of habits, he is compelled to note that passive impressions do not furnish a complete or adequate explanation.  With Laromiguiere he distinguishes attention as an active effort, of no less importance than the passive receptivity of sense, and like Joseph Butler, he distinguishes passively formed customs from active habits.  He concluded that Condillac's notion of passive receptivity as the one source of conscious experience was an error of method - in short, that the mechanical mode of viewing consciousness as formed by external influence was fallacious and deceptive.  For it he proposed to substitute the genetic method, whereby human conscious experience might be exhibited as growing or developing from its essential basis in connection with external conditions.  The essential basis he finds in the real consciousness, of self as an active striving power, and the stages of its development, corresponding to what one may call the relative importance of the external conditions and the reflective clearness of self-consciousness he designates as the affective, the perceptive and the reflective.  In connexion with this Biran treats most of the obscure problems which arise in dealing with conscious experience, such as the mode by which the organism is cognized, the mode by which the organism is distinguished from extra-organic things, and the nature of those general ideas by which the relations of things are known to us - cause, power, force, etc. In the last stage of his philosophy, Biran distinguished the animal existence from the human, under which the three forms above noted are classed.  And both from the life of the spirit, in which human thought is brought into relation with the supersensible, divine system of things.  This stage is left imperfect.  Altogether Biran's work presents a very remarkable specimen of deep metaphysical thinking directed by preference to the psychological aspect of experience. So, it has been said there are three stages marking the development of his philosophy.  Up to 1804, a stage called by Naville \"the philosophy of sensation\", he was a follower of Condillac's sensism, as modified by de Tracy, which he soon abandoned in favour of a system based on an analysis of internal reflection.  In the second stage -- the philosophy of will -- 1804-18, to avoid materialism and fatalism, he embraced the doctrine of immediate apperception, showing that man knows himself and exterior things by the resistance to his effort.  On reflecting he remarks the voluntary effort which differentiates his internal from his external experience, thus learning to distinguish between the ego and the non-ego.  In the third stage -- the philosophy of religion -- after 1818, we find de Biran advocating a mystical intuitional psychology.  To man's two states of life: representation (common to animals), and volition (volition, sensation, and perception), he adds a third: love or life of union with God, in which the life of Divine grace absorbs representation and volition.  Maine de Biran's style is laboured, but he is reckoned by Cousin as the greatest French metaphysician from the time of Malebranche.  His genius was not fully recognized till after his death, as the essay \"Sur l'habitude\" (Paris, 1803) was the only book that appeared under his name during his lifetime; but his reputation was firmly established on the publication of his writings, partly by Cousin (\"OEuvres philosophiques de Maine de Biran\", Paris, 1834-41), and partly by Naville (\"OEuvres inedites de Maine de Biran\", Paris, 1859). Equating \"cause\" with \"force\"  Schopenhauer, claimed that \"No one has carried this confusion, or rather identification, of natural force with cause so far as Maine de Biran in his Nouvelles considerations des rapports du physique au moral, since this is essential to his philosophy. \" This confusion of force of nature and cause occurred often throughout the book.  \"[W]hen he speaks of causes, he hardly ever puts cause alone, but almost always says cause ou force. . . . \" Schopenhauer believed that the confusion was intentional.  Biran was \"conscious of identifying two disparate concepts in order to be able to make use of either of them according to the circumstances. \" Therefore, he purposely equated cause with force in order \"to keep the identification present in the readers mind.

Philip Hallies study is the first, book-length, sympathetic study in English of Birans epistemology.  Biran was concerned to present the case for an Empiricism that did not try to explain away either inner or outer experience, but which saw both as equally necessary for a doctrine of the source of human knowledge.  Biran was throroughly convinced of the soundness of Lock, Hume, and Berkeley, but he attacked them vigorously for failing to acknowledge the importance of the internal experience of voluntary bodily movement.  Birans meticulous analysis of the English Empiricists provides a basis for understanding their differences as well as similarities, and suggest that the contemporary counterparts of Biran (Sartre, Ricoeur, and Merleu-Ponty, for example) may be closer to contemporary counterparts of the British Empiricists (A.  J.  Ayer and H.  H.  Price, for example) than has yet been noticed. ", "article_2": "Your complimentary articles Youve read one of your four complimentary articles for this month.

If you come across any French person and ask them about Rene Descartes, Jean-Jacques Rousseau or Jean Paul Sartre, the chances are theyll say the name rings a bell.  If you ask them about Maine de Biran, first theyll say 'Pardon?, and upon you repeating the three odd words, theyll go blank - unless they belong to the chosen few who happen to have been schooled at the Lycee Maine de Biran in Bergerac.  But youd have to be pretty lucky to stumble upon them; and, indeed, to be in a situation where the name 'Maine de Biran would be likely to occur at all.  The truth is, Biran is not your average bestselling philosopher.  Having published very little in his lifetime (29 November 1766-20 July 1824), he rose to only relative philosophical prominence in the nineteenth century thanks to the posthumous publication of his extensive manuscripts.  In addition, he can be said to only ever have had one idea, which shapes all of his philosophical considerations in a way that may seem rather repetitive.  But this idea was arguably one of the first dents in the Enlightenment consensus on the need to objectify, categorise and classify all things on what Michel Foucault referred to as the 'flat space of [a] spreadsheet (The Order of Things, 1966).  Biran forces us to rethink what we understand by 'observation and 'facts.  Maine De Biran by Clinton Inman, 2019 Portrait (c) Clinton Inman 2018.  Facebook him at clinton. inman A Political Life Francois-Pierre-Gontier de Biran, known as Maine, was born into a family of Bergerac notables in 1766.  He was to be a close witness to, and occasionally even an actor in, some of the defining events of the Revolution of 1789 and its immediate aftermath.  Biran spent most of the Terror in his family property of Grateloup.  He was a member of the Royal Guard from 1785 to its dissolution in 1792.  After the demise of Robespierre in 1794, Biran was made administrator of the Dordogne by the Convention.  Then after a brief spell as an elected representative in the Directory in 1797, he again disappeared from the public sphere until 1802, when he got another chance to make his mark on local politics in his native Dordogne and Bergerac, mainly in the latters prefectural services.  As part of Napoleon Bonapartes imperial Legislative Body from 1812 to the Restoration of the monarchy in 1814, he made his name by joining a commission demanding peace, an end to Napoleons politics of expansion, and the respect of individual and political rights.  A monarchist by nurture and by nature, he welcomed the end of Napoleons rule and the return of Louis XVIII (younger brother of Louis XVI) in 1814, seeing it as a promise of stability.  He went on to represent the Dordogne in the Chamber of Deputies almost without interruption until his death in 1824.  A keen student of epistemology (theory of knowledge) from an early age, Biran never ceased to write and debate with his friends, mentors and proteges throughout his sometimes high-profile career.  Although his perfectionism meant that he could not bring himself to publish what he often regarded as incomplete reflections on the subject, his work was noted and sometimes rewarded by prestigious institutions such as the newly founded 'Institut Francais in 1802, and the academies of Berlin (in 1807) and Copenhagen (in 1811).  New, Internal Kinds of Facts As a child of the eighteenth century, Biran was a firm empiricist.  Influenced by the work of Etienne Bonnot de Condillac (1714-1780), he initially believed that ideas are the product of sensory impressions, and that as a result the mind is mostly passive in its acquisition of knowledge, both of the outside world and of its own contents.  In the 1790s Biran became acquainted with the Ideologues, a collective headed by Antoine Destutt de Tracy and Pierre Jean Georges Cabanis.  The ambition of the Ideologues was to map out the birth, life and death of ideas in a way which would help promote the educative and regenerative work of the Revolution.  Understanding ideas as objects, and minds as mere receptacles, implied that all of Frances future citizens could be shaped into a prescribed mould of thought.  Biran was eager to play his part in the cultural aspects of the revolution, although he had reservations about the regime change, as he was convinced that legitimacy rested with the King.  In 1802 he published a study of Linfluence de lhabitude sur la faculte de penser (The Influence of Habit on the Faculty of Thinking).  In it he observed that habit had a paradoxical effect on intellectual operations, making them simultaneously more focused and accurate, and more spontaneous and unconscious.  Birans account of the influence of habit on thinking hinted at the behind-the-scenes work of an active faculty akin to the will, but he fell short of explaining what this faculty might be or how it might work.  There was a good reason for this.  Condillac and the Ideologues empiricist premises could not harbour the notion of a spontaneously creative will.  In a world ruled by physical and mental cause and effect, nothing can be its own cause - which is precisely what the will would be if it is to be at all.  This dogma became increasingly frustrating for Biran, who wanted to find a firm ground for his philosophy - some place where self-consciousness could be originated and chosen by the will instead of being the mere accidental consequence of mechanically determined phenomena.  This firm ground he eventually found in himself, in what he called the 'primitive fact of the intimate sense.  In short, it was the intimate sense of the effort of will which made one conscious of oneself.  As an empiricist, Biran was keen to stick to facts.  But he soon came to realise that this did not mean that facts could only be externally verifiable.  Looking inward, he found that what created the spark of self-consciousness was the confrontation of his own hyper-organic force (a vital force whose origin was impossible to ascertain) with the resistance of his own (organic) body or of an external object.  Self-consciousness could only exist if it was being resisted at the very same time of its occurrence - by the body, or by an external object: \"as soon as the effort unfolds, there is a subject and an object, each constituted in relation to each other. . .  Without this effort everything is passive and absolute. . .  With it, everything refers to a person who wants and acts\" (Memoire sur la decomposition de la pensee, 1805).  So for Biran, self-consciousness was above all the result of an act of will: an act which he thought could not be accounted for in the same way as, say, gravity, or the action of one billiard ball on another.  Here Biran managed to still respond to the empiricist demand that facts be based on experience while undermining the Enlightenment claim that everything worth knowing was objectifiable, quantifiable, and comparable.  The incommunicable nature of the sense of effort, and the idea, implied in the necessary interdependence of resistance and effort, that self-consciousness is inseparable from otherness, soared beyond the traditional empiricism favoured by the likes of Condillac, Cabanis, and Destutt de Tracy.  But Biran went further, arguing that all of our basic ideas of how the world is regulated - of causality, force, unity, identity, and permanence, among others - were derived from the primitive fact of the act of self-consciousness.  For instance, our general idea of causality was abstracted from our sense of being the cause of an effort when acting.  Our ideas of unity, identity, and permanence were the intellectualised expression of the unity, identity, and permanence of a self which in its willed effort recognised itself in the midst of an infinite stream of ever-changing sensations.  The same logic applied to 'normal ideas - of a tree, a cloud, or a cat, for example.  To become easily identifiable among other sensations as a distinct idea, a sensory impression had to be actively received by the willing self.  Birans account of what regulates our perception was as far removed from Immanuel Kants a priori categories of thought as it was from David Humes argument for the impossibility of proving causal links.  Instead, it was firmly grounded in creative willing.  Mind versus Body in Thought and Life With the primitive fact of the inner sense, Biran had found his fulcrum, his point dappui.  He had also salvaged the minds active nature from the passivity implied by Condillacs empiricism.  But he had also re-established dualism, by erecting an insurmountable barrier between the active self and its 'passive counterpart, the organic body.  In spite of their interdependence, and of the appropriation of sensations through willed effort, in Birans theory mind and body remain constantly at war.  The body constantly threatens to swallow the mind, which in turn only exists in affirmation against its organic counterpart.  This tension reflects the tension between our social and our personal lives.  Although it started almost accidentally, Birans career as a statesman survived a revolution, an empire, and the restoration of the monarchy.  Behind this apparently successful career, however, was a man forever torn between his desire to please in the public sphere, and his hankering after solitude in nature.  Birans Journal is an enlightening record of his complex emotional response to public and social life.  Throughout its pages he appears painfully aware that no mark of approval or affection could ever quench his desperate need for recognition; and yet he readily acknowledges that he cannot help but act upon that need: \" this is the source of all my sorrows and disappointments in life.  I have always wanted, I still want, to seem what I am not, and keep on neglecting what I could be\" (Journal, III).  This craving he saw as a mode of the bodys proneness to sensual gratification - a tendency which inevitably leads one to seek society and to play all sorts of roles and games, thereby damaging ones moral integrity: \"Natural passions have their source in organic life and belong to the animal side of man. . .  Social passions always combine with natural passions and complicate them\" (Journal, II).  The Journal also shows how Biran continuously exhorted himself to fight off his social passions, to recollect his thoughts and reunify his self, and how this was helped by the seclusion and contemplation afforded by his family residence.  There the thinkers efforts could unfold properly, at last.  This is perhaps one of the most interesting features of Birans will.  Nowadays willpower is more often than not associated with the determination to succeed according to externally established standards.  Birans will, by contrast, expressed itself most powerfully by his shutting the world away and turning inwards.  The Utilitarian Threat Birans emphasis on the conflict between the self and the senses reflects his temperament and attitude.  But rooting his real-life tensions in a universal physiological and psychological divide shows that he saw this divide and these tensions as essential to human experience.  This made for fertile ground when it came to criticising the excesses of a certain kind of empiricism and its moral applications - so much so that Biran can be credited for providing us with one of the first philosophical critiques of utilitarianism.  Although no explicit mention of Jeremy Benthams (1748-1832) works is to be found in Birans writings, in his Journal he makes a number of allusions to some of the core principles of Benthams utilitarianism, and Birans philosophy is based on a partial rejection of the empiricist premises on which that doctrine is founded.  Bentham wrote that \"nature has placed mankind under the governance of two sovereign masters, pain and pleasure\" (An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation, 1789), and he advocated a moral system directed to the maximisation of the latter.  In doing so he was merely taking the core empiricist and sensualist premises to their natural conclusions: sensations were the only experiential reality the role of which everyone could agree on.  The new moral order would be all about collective happiness understood as the generalisation of the individual search for pleasure, and it did not matter which pleasure, as long as it did not interfere too obviously with other individual pursuits of the same kind.  However, for Biran, utilitarian morals were mistaken in that the empiricist premises on which they were founded were only partly true.  There had to be more to life than pleasure and pain, if only because the idea of free will (which even Benthams system relied on) means more than being a mere weathervane blown about by ever-changing sensations.  Yet Biran was acutely aware that for all its wrong assumptions, utilitarian morality could become a self-fulfilling prophecy, given that theres always a \"concordance between speculative systems and practical morals\" (Journal, II).  With pleasure and pain becoming the cardinal points of moral science, people were free to blindly follow their own impulses to the detriment of others and of their own fulfilment.  This could only lead to stagnant existences, and unbridled selfishness: \"Those who think that everything in man is founded on feelings of pleasure and pain, must believe too that the individual is the be all and end all of his existence: duty is then a word devoid of any meaning, and so is the idea of the absolute: everything is forever likely to change, along with place, time and sensitive dispositions. \" (Journal, II) Biran thought that as a result of empiricism and utilitarianism, his was a time \"where generous sentiments [were] practically extinct in all souls, and where human actions [were] only considered through the prism of utility or material advantages\" (Journal, I).  This was to heap a lot of blame upon those philosophies; but perhaps he understood utilitarianism as the theoretical justification for the nascent capitalism.  Birans suggested cure for these ills - moral firmness and established values - may appear rather conservative to us; but it should be remembered that his basis for these values was quite original.  The immediate apperception of the self through self-willing effort was where Biran found both individual moral strength and a reason to respect others, as free agents engaged in their very own intimate struggle with incessant natural and social stimuli.  His conception of will was thus less an accompaniment to triumphant economic liberalism than a warning of and potential tool against some of its most manifest perils.  God and the 'Third Life Birans values were initially founded on a generalisation of his introspective psychology, and as such did not rely on any transcendental truth.  Even his monarchism could be said, if not to originate, then at least to be consolidated by his belief that the state, like the individual, needed to organise itself around principles of unity and permanence.  Still, as the vicissitudes of life started to take their toll, Biran became increasingly aware that his 'firm ground of the self-willing self was not enough to yield a peaceful and rewarding life.  Free will was not a given, but needed to be constantly reaffirmed in the face of countless physical ailments and social disappointments.  There is no end to this balancing act.  This led Biran to seek peace and contentment in an experience in the inner self coming from a higher source, and for Biran there was no mistaking that this higher source was God.  But here again, Biran was intent on accounting for the phenomenon in a philosophical way: \"Until now, I have tried to establish a metaphysical theory by consulting my intimate sense and paying close attention. . .  to all consequences derived from the facts of this intimate sense. . .  If I find God and the true laws of the moral order, it will be pure happiness, and I shall be more credible than those who, starting from prejudices, only try and establish the latter through their theories. \" (Journal, I) Birans last decade was to be dedicated to 'finding God, both personally and metaphysically.  By the end of his life, he had discovered that beyond the 'first and the 'second lives of man (the animal/sensitive and the human/rational aspects respectively), was a third life, characterised by a calm and contentment which could only be the act of a higher power.  The Afterlife of the Self-Willed Self Maine de Biran was both a man of the eighteenth century in his attempt to organise his thought in a systematic and transparent way, and a man of the nineteenth century in his subversion of classical empiricism through an acknowledgment of the most fundamental human experience.  While his ideas were coloured by an undeniable traditionalism when it came to morals and politics, he cleared the way for the emergence of modern philosophies such as French Eclecticism (Victor Cousins attempt to bridge the gap between Cartesian rationalism and empiricism), French Spiritualism (culminating in Henri Bergsons philosophy of mind and creativity), and last but not least, French existentialism.  When he died in 1824 after years of ill-health, Biran was hailed as 'our mentor by Pierre Paul Royer-Collard, and even 'our Kant by Jules Lachelier.  But some hundred and fifty years later, F. C. T.  Moore remarked that \"Maine de Biran is an author almost without critics, indeed, almost without readers in the English philosophical tradition\" (The Psychology of Maine de Biran, 1970).  The situation does not seem to have changed much.  It may primarily be down to the fact that there are only a few available English translations of Birans writings (his work on The Relationship between the Physical and the Moral in Man was translated and published by Bloomsbury Academic in 2016).  But even in France, although a handful of academics have devoted their careers to editing and analysing his works, Biran remains largely unknown - as though notoriety, just like freedom, was bound to escape him.

Born with the surname Gonthier de Biran, he adopted Maine after his fathers estate, Le Maine.  After defending King Louis XVI at Versailles in October 1789 as one of the kings lifeguards at the start of the French Revolution, Maine de Biran retired to his own estate at Grateloup, near Bergerac, to study philosophy and mathematics.  After the fall of Robespierre in 1794, he entered public life as an administrator in the Dordogne district.  In 1813 he expressed publicly his opposition to Napoleon.  After the restoration of the Bourbons in 1814, he became treasurer to the chamber of deputies in the government of King Louis XVIII.  Philosophically, Maine de Biran was known at first as one of the Ideologues, a school of philosophers who regarded all experience as being limited to the realm of sensation.  In 1802 he had impressed the Institut de France with an essay upholding the views of the dominant Ideologues.  A similar essay won him election to the institute in 1805.  His importance, however, consists in his gradual and detailed exposition of the inadequacies of the Ideologue attitude.  His diary (Journal, 3 vol. , ed.  H.  Gouhier; 1954-57) discusses both his political and his philosophical activities and reveals the dilemmas of a philosopher who felt compelled to play a decisive role in politics.  In the diary and in his other works he is preoccupied with the inner life, whose importance for experience the Ideologues had ignored.  Already in the essay of 1802 he had suggested that the will, as well as sensation, was a necessary element for any analysis of the self.  After 1805 he attached increased importance to the will, by which man could cause his body to move.  For his idea of human freedom, derived from this notion of willed movement, Maine de Biran has been considered by some to be the father of French Existentialist philosophy.  His collected works, which fill 14 volumes (ed.  Pierre Tisserand, 1920-49), include the Essai sur les fondements de la psychologie (1812; \"Essay on the Fundamentals of Psychology\") and Nouveaux Essais danthropologie (1823-24; \"New Essays in Anthropology\").  In the later essays he describes the human self as developing through a purely sensitive, animal phase, the vie animale (\"animal life\"), to a phase of will and freedom, the vie humaine (\"human life\"), and culminating in experiences that transcend humanity, the vie de lesprit (\"spiritual life\").

His contributions to medicine include Trousseau sign of malignancy, Trousseau sign of latent tetany, Trousseau-Lallemand bodies (an archaic synonym for Bence Jones proteins).  He is sometimes credited with the quip \"use new drugs quickly, while they still work\", though Michel-Philippe Bouvart had said the same over 40 years earlier. A native of Tours, Indre-et-Loire, Armand Trousseau began his medical studies in his native town as a pupil of Pierre Fidele Bretonneau at the local general hospital.  He later continued his studies in Paris, where he received his doctorate in 1825 and became adjunct faculty in 1827.  In 1828, the French government assigned him to investigate epidemics ravaging some parts of southern France.  After completing his mission the same year, Trousseau travelled to Gibraltar as a member of a commission to investigate yellow fever.  This work, and a monograph on laryngeal phthisis, led to his early recognition in Paris.  In 1830 Trousseau became Medecin des hopitaux through concours, and in 1832 received a position in public health with the central bureau while working as a physician in the Hotel-Dieu under Joseph Claude Anthelme Recamier.  In 1837 he received the great prize of the academy.  In 1839 he was appointed physician at the Hopital St.  Antoine and eventually became Chair of therapy and pharmacology at the Paris medical faculty.  In 1850 he assumed the Chair of clinical medicine and again commenced working in the Hotel-Dieu.  He was also active in politics, particularly after the French Revolution of 1848, holding several positions including being a member of the legislative body.  During his later years Trousseau developed gastric cancer. Coincidentally, he previously described Trousseau sign of malignancy and developed a similar finding in himself.  This cancer limited his activities and eventually proved fatal. Trousseau was instrumental in creating new modes of treatment of croup, emphysema, pleurisy, goiter, and malaria.  He received the prize of the French Academy of Medicine for his classic essay on laryngology which originally appeared in 1837.  He was the first in France to perform a tracheotomy, and he wrote a monograph on this as well as intubation in 1851.  His textbooks on clinical medicine and therapeutics were both extremely popular and translated into English.  Trousseau coined the terms aphasia and forme fruste and popularized eponyms in disease description such as Addison's disease and Hodgkin's lymphoma.  In 1833, Trousseau invented the Trousseau Tracheal Dilator, a blunt-nosed forceps designed to allow easier access to a tracheostomy stoma. Trousseau was considered an outstanding teacher.  Numerous students of his achieved fame in their own right, including Puerto Rican pro-independence leader, surgeon and Legion d'honneur laureate, Ramon Emeterio Betances.

A leader of the French therapeutic renaissance, Trousseau was instrumental in creating new modes of treatment of croup, emphysema, pleurisy, goitre, and malaria.  Trousseau is believed to have died from the very syndrome which bears his name.

Often as the first presenting sign of visceral malignancy classically pancreatic cancer, but other tumours particularly adenocarcinomas, are associated.  In 1861 Trousseau stated that if the diagnosis of a suspected carcinoma of an internal organ could not be verified, the sudden and spontaneous appearance of thrombophlebitis in a large vein afforded necessary proof for diagnosis.  [See Ultrasound Case 097] So great, in my opinion, is the semiotic value of phlegmasia in the cancerous cachexia, that I regard this phlegmasia as a sign of the cancerous diathesis as certain as sanguinolent effusion into the serous cavities.  In the cachexiae, as I have told you, there exists a special crasis of the blood, which irrespective of inflammation, favours intravenous coagulation The originator of the term \"Trousseau Syndrome\" is unknown, but Trousseaus 1861 Lectures on Clinical Medicine has often been regarded as the first published work linking thrombosis and malignancy.  Trousseau spots [aka *tache cerebrale, meningitic streaks] The sign is elicited by firmly stroking the skin with a fingernail, tongue depressor, or a similar object.  There may be a brief period of blanching, followed within 15-30 seconds by the appearance of a line of erythema that spreads laterally beyond the original area of stimulus.  The width of the red line is related to the pressure of the stroke.  The red line may be flanked by thin pale areas and may be evident for several minutes.

He became agrege (qualified) in 1826 and made his early reputation on yellow fever and laryngeal phthisis.  The first to undertake tracheotomy in 1831, he popularised this intervention in the treatment of croup, usually due to diphtheria; he had a 25% success rate in 200 reported cases.  With Belloc he wrote a laryngeal classic in 1837 and with Pidoux a text on therapeutics (1839).  He was also the first to aspirate the pleural cavity (1843) and gave the first description of haemochromatosis.  In 1839 Trousseau was appointed physician to the Hopital Ste Antoine in Paris, later moving as physician-in-chief to the Hotel-Dieu in 1850.  He appreciated the value of bedside observation and was an outstanding clinician and teacher.  He was also extremely popular with colleagues and students because of the keenness of his intellect, his integrity, and generosity (fig 1).  Figure 1 Professor Armand Trousseau (1801-67).  In 1861-2 he published his famous two volume textClinique Medicale de lHotel-Dieu.  This great work went through many editions, the third of which (1868) was translated into English by Sir John Cormack and published by the New Sydenham Society. 1 It contained many accurate descriptions of diseases, especially the common infections of childhood such as scarlet fever, measles, rubella, mumps, diphtheria, whooping cough, cholera infantum and neonatal syphilis.  Trousseau realised the importance of Pasteurs work on fermentation and supported the doctrine of the specific nature of disease, as the following extract on puerperal fever and erysipelas of the newborn shows. 1 On puerperal infection \". . . are we not somewhat warranted to inquire, whether there does not exist in the atmosphere a morbid germ, which being deposited on the umbilical, or placental, wound, or on any surgical wound, will produce in one case phlebitis, and in another erysipelas, with or without purulent infection?. . .  These statements are not mere hypotheses: chemical analysis and the microscope prove the existence of morbific dust in hospital wards. . . dressings returned from the lavatories have been found still soiled with organic detritus, with linseed, and with spots, recalling the uses to which they had been formerly applied.  Might not these linens, stained with blood and altered pus, be vehicles of contagion?. .  There has always existed, from reasoning, a strong disposition to attribute much in the spread of endemics and epidemics, to the transport of morbific molecules; and now, the same conclusion has been arrived at from direct examination of the atmosphere. . .  The germs which may exist in the atmosphere at a given time, under circumstances to be determined by future inquiry, will not become developed with equal facility in all patients, because persons differ exceedingly in respect of the conditions of receptivity: certain organisms, like certain soils, will not accept certain germs. . .  I believe that hospital hygienics embrace means by which the germs of infection may be neutralised, and its progress modified, should the germs become developed. . .  In conclusion, it is the duty of the physician, to place his patients under the most favourable hygienical conditions, which can be obtained. . . \" On erysipelas of the newborn and puerperal fever \"Erysipelas occurring during the first fifteen or twenty days of life is inevitably fatal. . . it is characterised by a vivid redness of skin, and a hard, shining appearance of the subjacent cellular tissue. . . epidemic puerperal fever presides over the pathology of (erysipelas in) new-born infants. . .  The umbilicus and the uterus equally present an open way for the entrance of infection; so that if both mother and infant are placed under the same epidemic influence, it is not surprising that both should contract the same disease, just as happens to hospital patients with open wounds when similarly exposed. \" Trousseaus text contains many other splendid descriptions--on lactation and dentition, on infantile convulsions, laryngismus stridulus and tetany including, of course, Trousseaus sign of carpal spasm following occlusion of the arterial blood supply to the lower arm. 2 Best of all were his insights, 80 years ahead of his time,2 into the origin and management of rickets and osteomalacia.  He argued that rickets was a disease brought about by nutritional deficiency and a sunless climate, that it was brought on by rapid growth, that osteomalacia was adult rickets, and that the disease could be treated by cod liver oil and exposure to sunlight.  He based his views on the clinical observations of his teacher, Bretonneau, as well as on the experimental studies of Dr Jules Guerin (1838) on young puppies, as well as his own on young pigs.  On rickets and its deformities \"Rickets is a disease of early infancy: it generally supervenes at the apoch of dentition, that is to say, towards the end of the first year of life, or during the first six months of the second year . . .  when rickets is arrested in its progress after having acquired a certain intensity, the lesions which it has produced often remain and are incurable, continuing for life, so that the unfortunate sufferers retain horrible deformities . . .  these deformities are due to softening of the bones: so great is the softening, that when one tries to bend the limbs in their continuity, very great flexion is the result . . .  while the cavity of the true pelvis is contracted, the large pelvis has, on the contrary, a greater capacity . . .  the greater pelvis becomes spread out, and this spreading out contributes to the contraction of the lesser pelvis . . . \" On the aetiology of rickets \"I now come, Gentlemen, to a great question - the etiology of rickets - a question of far greater importance than one might at first be inclined to suppose . . .  Climate has an undoubted influence upon the development of rickets.  The disease is unquestionably much more common in damp cold countries than elsewhere . . .  But of the causes of this disease, insufficient aliment is the most powerful . . .  rickets is in great part dependant upon disorder in the function of nutrition, which is again dependant upon faulty feeding . . .  attentive observation convinces me that it is most common in infants weaned before dentition is sufficiently advanced, and fed on pap, vegetables, and even meat, in place of milk regimen which is better adapted to their digestive aptitudes . . . \" On rickets and osteomalacia \"Ought we to consider, that there is a similarity between osteomalacia and rickets? I say we ought . . .  Osteomalacia supervenes at a period when the component parts of the skeleton have attained their complete development; and the rickets of children supervenes when the process of ossification is in progress . . .  In the genesis of osteomalacia, as well as in that of the rickets of children, we can trace the influence of bad hygienical conditions . . .  At puberty, that is, at the period of life nearest to the period of childhood, the disease most frequently develops itself . . .  After puberty, there are other circumstances which may favour the development of the disease.  Thus, it is not uncommon to see women attacked with rickets after having had several children, or even, it may be, after a first confinement, the disease beginning immediately after delivery . . .  There exists, therefore, in pregnant women, a certain kind of rickets, of which osteomalacia may be considered as a more advanced stage . . . \" On the treatment and prevention of rickets \"Gentlemen, I am also strongly led to believe, that rickets and osteomalacia are the same disease, by the fact, that both are wonderfully combated by the same medication.  This medication may be considered as really heroic in the treatment of rickets: it consists in giving cod-liver oil, and, in a more general way, fish oil . . .  For very young infants, for those in whom the first dentition is not completed, milk, particularly the milk of a good nurse, must constitute the exclusive food.  I attach so much importance to this rule, that I do not hesitate to prolong lactation beyond the usual term.  By doing so, and without the use of any other means, I have seen the recovery of rachitic children . . .  In infants, after the first period of infancy, and in adults, the regimen ought to consist of a varied combination of animal and vegetable food, care being taken that the former predominates . . . \" Unfortunately, Trousseaus remarkable account was largely forgotten by 1900 and it was not until 1919 when Mellanby and others discovered vitamin D, that this common and disabling condition was brought under control.  Trousseau became professor of clinical medicine at the University of Paris and must be regarded as one of the greatest of French teachers.  Many of his students achieved distinction including Dieulafoy, Da Costa, Brown-Sequard and Lasegne.  He also did much to support and publicise the work of Duchenne and Charcot.  For a time he was a Representative of the People at the National Assembly.  He was also a member of the Imperial Academy of Medicine and several other European Societies.  Many honours came his way, including Commander of the Legion of Honour and Grand Officer of the Order of the Lion and the Sun of Persia.  His writings were translated and published in Britain, America, Spain and Germany.  He died at the age of 65 in 1867. "}}

Although Fleming received most of the credit for the discovery of penicillin, it was Florey who carried out the first clinical trials of penicillin in 1941 at the Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford on the first patient, a police constable from Oxford.  The patient started to recover, but subsequently died because Florey was unable, at that time, to make enough penicillin.  It was Florey and Chain who actually made a useful and effective drug out of penicillin, after the task had been abandoned as too difficult.  Florey's discoveries, along with the discoveries of Fleming and Ernst Chain, are estimated to have saved over 200 million lives, and he is consequently regarded by the Australian scientific and medical community as one of its greatest figures.  Sir Robert Menzies, Australia's longest-serving Prime Minister, said, \"In terms of world well-being, Florey was the most important man ever born in Australia. Howard Florey was born in Malvern, a southern suburb of Adelaide, Province of South Australia, the youngest of three children and the only son. His father, Joseph Florey, was an English immigrant, and his mother Bertha Mary Wadham was a second-generation Australian.: 255 His sister Hilda Gardner became a bacteriologist and a pioneer of laboratory medicine. Florey was educated at Kyre College Preparatory School (now Scotch College) and then St Peter's College, Adelaide, where he excelled in chemistry and physics, but not mathematics. He also played various sports for the school: cricket, football, athletics, and tennis.: 255 He studied medicine at the University of Adelaide from 1917 to 1921, paid entirely by a state scholarship he had achieved. Florey continued his studies at Magdalen College, Oxford, as a Rhodes Scholar under the tutelage of Sir Charles Scott Sherrington, receiving the degrees of BA in 1924 and MA in 1935. In 1925, he left Oxford to attend the University of Cambridge, during which time he won a fellowship from the Rockefeller Foundation and studied in the United States for ten months.  He returned to England in 1926 and was elected to a fellowship at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, and a year later he received the degree of PhD.: 258-259 Flasks used in the cultivation of penicillin mold for large-scale production.  One of the first flasks (center) was made using a biscuit tin.  Ceramic flasks (rear) were used in the production of penicillin.  (Historical Collections, National Museum of Health and Medicine , M-722. 10002, M-722. After Cambridge, Florey was appointed to the Joseph Hunter Chair of Pathology at the University of Sheffield in 1932.  In 1935, he returned to Oxford, as Professor of Pathology and Fellow of Lincoln College, Oxford, leading a team of researchers.  Working with Ernst Boris Chain, Norman Heatley and Edward Abraham, he read Alexander Fleming's paper discussing the antibacterial effects of Penicillium notatum mould.: 260-262 In 1941, he and Chain treated their first patient, Albert Alexander, who had had a small sore at the corner of his mouth, which then spread, leading to a severe facial infection involving streptococci and staphylococci.  His whole face, eyes and scalp were swollen to the extent that he had had an eye removed to relieve the pain.  Within a day of being given penicillin, he started to recover.  However, the researchers did not have enough penicillin to help him to a full recovery, and he relapsed and died.  Because of this experience and the difficulty in producing penicillin, the researchers changed their focus to children, who could be treated with smaller quantities of penicillin. Florey's research team investigated the large-scale production of the mould and efficient extraction of the active ingredient, succeeding to the point where, by 1945, penicillin production was an industrial process for the Allies in World War II.  However, Florey said that the project was originally driven by scientific interests, and that the medicinal discovery was a bonus: People sometimes think that I and the others worked on penicillin because we were interested in suffering humanity.  I don't think it ever crossed our minds about suffering humanity.  This was an interesting scientific exercise, and because it was of some use in medicine is very gratifying, but this was not the reason that we started working on it. -- Howard Florey Developing penicillin was a team effort, as these things tend to be. -- Howard Florey Florey shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1945 with Ernst Boris Chain and Alexander Fleming.  Fleming first observed the antibiotic properties of the mould that makes penicillin, but it was Chain and Florey who developed it into a useful treatment. In 1958, Florey opened the John Curtin School of Medical Research at ANU in Canberra.  In 1965, the Queen made him Lord Florey and he was offered, and accepted, the role of Chancellor of the Australian National University. On 18 July 1944 Florey was appointed a Knight Bachelor. In 1947, he won the Gold Medal of the Royal Society of Medicine. He was awarded the Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh and the Lister Medal in 1945, for his contributions to surgical science. The corresponding Lister Oration, given at the Royal College of Surgeons of England later that year, was titled \"Use of Micro-organisms for Therapeutic Purposes\". In 1946, the University of Sao Paulo awarded him an honorary doctorate. Florey Building Florey was elected a member of the Royal Society in 1941 and became president in 1958. In 1962, Florey became Provost of The Queen's College, Oxford.  During his term as Provost, the college built a new residential block, named the Florey Building in his honour.  The building was designed by the British architect Sir James Stirling.  On 4 February 1965, Sir Howard was created a life peer and became Baron Florey, of Adelaide in the State of South Australia and Commonwealth of Australia and of Marston in the City of Oxford. This was a higher honour than the knighthood awarded to penicillin's discoverer, Sir Alexander Fleming, and it recognised the monumental work Florey had done in making penicillin available in sufficient quantities to save millions of lives in the war, despite Fleming's doubts that this was feasible.  On 15 July 1965 Florey was appointed a Member of The Order of Merit. Florey was Chancellor of the Australian National University from 1965 until his death in 1968.  The lecture theatre at the John Curtin School of Medical Research was named for him during his tenure at the ANU. Florey on the 50 Australian dollar note in circulation between 1973 and 1995 Florey's portrait appeared on the Australian $50 note for 22 years (1973-95), and the suburb of Florey in the Australian Capital Territory is named after him. The Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health, located at the University of Melbourne, Victoria, and a lecture theatre in the University of Adelaide's medical school are also named after him. The defunct Australian Student Prize, given to outstanding high-school leavers, was previously called the \"Lord Florey Student Prize\" in recognition of Florey. The Florey Unit of the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading, Berkshire, is named after him. The Florey Institute for Host-Pathogen Interactions at the University of Sheffield is named in his honour. The Florey Science Centre at St Peter's College, Adelaide, is named after him, as he attended the college.  It was opened post 1950.  The building facilitates science classes for students from Year 7 to Year 12.  On the lowest floor's concourse there is a commemorative statue and plaque. Howard Florey with sister Hilda Gardener on arrival in Melbourne, 1944 At the University of Adelaide, he met Ethel Reed (Mary Ethel Hayter Reed) (1900-1966), another medical student, who became both his wife and his research colleague.  They had two children: Paquita Mary Joanna and Charles du Ve. After the death of his wife Ethel, he married in 1967 his long-time colleague and research assistant Margaret Jennings (1904-1994).  He died of a congestive heart failure in 1968 and was honoured with a memorial service at Westminster Abbey, London.  His sister Hilda Gardner (1890 - 1953) was an Australian bacteriologist, who was a pioneer of laboratory medicine in Australia, specialising in infections and infectious diseases.  Joan Gardner, his niece through Hilda,was also a renowned microbiologist and infection control expert.

", "article_1": "Lived 1898 - 1968.  In the 1930s, penicillin was known only as an interesting curiosity.  The few scientists who had heard of it knew it as an unusual bacteria-killing substance produced by a microscopic fungus.  Nobody had found an effective way to produce penicillin or use it in medical treatments.  In the early 1940s, Howard Florey and his scientific team transformed penicillin into a potent antibiotic.  In doing so, they revolutionized medical science, helped the Allies win World War 2, and went on to save countless millions of lives.  Howard Florey, Ernst Chain, and Alexander Fleming shared the 1945 Nobel Prize in Medicine - Fleming for penicillins original discovery in 1928 and Florey & Chain for transforming it into a bacteria-killing magic bullet.  Advertisements Beginnings Howard Walter Florey was born on September 24, 1898 in the city of Adelaide, South Australia.  His father, Joseph Florey, was a shoemaker, and his mother Bertha Mary Wadham was a housewife.  The family was prosperous - Josephs shoemaking business was expanding, opening new branches.  Howard grew up with four older sisters - he had two half-sisters from Josephs first marriage and two elder sisters.  Josephs first wife died of tuberculosis.  At school (Kyre College Preparatory, then St Peters Collegiate) Howard excelled at sport and academically.  He won a number of university scholarships and represented his school in tennis, athletics, gymnastics and football competitions.  His favorite subject was chemistry, but his headmaster told his father there was no demand for chemists in Australia.  Medical Degree & Ships Doctor In 1916, age 18, Howard Florey began a medical degree at the University of Adelaide.  Highly disciplined and hard working, he came first in most exams.  His father died in 1918, and it turned out that his shoemaking business was insolvent.  Howard Florey continued his medical studies thanks to scholarships.  In 1921, he graduated as top student and was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship for the University of Oxford.  He served as the ships doctor on the long voyage to the UK.  A Decade of Learning: UK and USA Having voyaged to the other side of the world, Florey immediately embarked on another major journey, an intellectual one, working in various locations, studying several disciplines, and carrying out increasingly sophisticated research work.  In 1923, he gained a first class degree in Physiology from Oxford and developed a new method to place transparent windows in living tissues.  He traveled as medical officer on an expedition to the Arctic.  In 1924, at Cambridge, he researched blood flow changes taking place in thrombosis.  In 1925, he was awarded a Rockefeller fellowship taking him to Philadelphia to learn microsurgical methods and to Chicago to study mucus secretion.  In 1926, he became a research fellow at the London Hospital.  The work failed to excite him - he felt it was too routine.  He found he did not enjoy living in London.  In October 1927, age 29, he returned to Cambridge as a Pathology lecturer.  Cambridge awarded him a PhD for his earlier research on blood flow.  In 1932, he accepted an offer to become Professor of Pathology at the University of Sheffield.  The Discovery of Penicillin Lysozyme After three years at Sheffield, in 1935, age 37, Florey returned to Oxford as Chair of Pathology.  He attracted a number of highly talented graduate students to work in his department.  Also in 1935, a 28-year-old refugee from Nazi Germany, Ernst Chain, began lecturing at Oxford.  Chain was a biochemist, and in 1939 Florey recruited him to his lysozyme research project.  Lysozyme was a substance discovered in human body fluids and egg whites by Alexander Fleming in 1922.  His research identified lysozyme as a microbe killer.  \"The view has been generally held that the function of tears, saliva and sputum, so far as infections are concerned, was to rid the body of microbes by mechanically washing them away. . .  however, it is quite clear that these secretions, together with most of the tissues of the body, have the property of destroying microbes to a very high degree. \" Alexander Fleming Bacteriologist From Lysozyme to Penicillin Florey, the pathologist, asked Chain, the biochemist, to discover the mechanism involved when lysozyme dissolved bacteria.  Chain began a literature search and came across Flemings 1929 paper describing his discovery that Penicillium fungus produces a bacteria-killing substance.  Fleming named the substance penicillin and attempted to produce it on a larger scale, but failed.  Assistance from a skilled chemist or biochemist would have been a huge benefit in terms of isolating, purifying and concentrating penicillin as an antibiotic drug.  However, Flemings boss, Almroth Wright, disliked chemists and refused to allow them in his laboratory! Fleming gave a culture of his original Penicillium to Oxfords School of Pathology where it had been kept alive.  In 1938, Chain began some exploratory experiments with it.  The results were interesting.  Florey, helped by a generous grant from the Rockefeller Foundation, decided to abandon lysozyme and study penicillin.  A Penicillin Team Florey built a penicillin research team.  Its principle members were: Norman Heatley: Penicillium fungus growth.  Arthur Sanders: Penicillin extraction.  Ernst Chain, later with Edward Abraham: Penicillin purification and chemistry.  Arthur Gardner and Jena Orr-Ewing: Penicillin testing on selected harmful bacteria.  Howard Florey and Margaret Jennings: Penicillin testing on infected animals.  Penicillin Saves Mice In May 1940, Florey tested penicillin at a purity level of just 1 percent on mice infected with deadly streptococci.  The four mice he treated survived, while four untreated mice died.  Floreys team published their results in The Lancet in August 1940 with the title: Penicillin as a chemotherapeutic agent.  \"Penicillin does not appear to be related to any chemotherapeutic substance at present in use and is particularly remarkable for its activity against the anaerobic organisms associated with gas gangrene. \" Howard Florey et al.  The Lancet, 1940 \"Penicillin does not appear to be related to any chemotherapeutic substance at present in use and is particularly remarkable for its activity against the anaerobic organisms associated with gas gangrene. \" Penicillin Saves People In the fall of 1940, the Battle of Britain was raging: Britain was fighting for its existence against Nazi Germany.  Florey failed to persuade British drug companies to produce penicillin.  They were already running flat out on other war work.  His response, working with amazing intensity, was to turn his laboratories into a miniature penicillin factory.  By January 1941, he and his team had produced enough penicillin to begin clinical trials on six patients dying of bacterial infections in Oxfords Radcliffe Infirmary.  The infirmarys Dr.  Charles Fletcher supervised the trials, giving penicillin to all six dying patients.  Five survived.  One died after the penicillin supply ran out.  Everyone in Floreys team was thrilled.  Penicillin had saved five people from certain death.  Increasingly, the drug looked like the long-dreamed-of magic bullet - a bacteria killer with no toxicity to humans.  Scaling Up In June 1941, Florey and Heatley travelled to America to describe their penicillin production process.  The U. S.  government offered money to any American company willing to produce penicillin on a large scale.  The money was needed because, although Floreys method was suitable for small-scale production, it was not suitable for industrial-scale production.  Meanwhile Floreys own lab-factory continued operating.  By 1942, he had enough penicillin for a larger-scale clinical trial on 187 patients at the Radcliffe Infirmary, which was again successful.  Robert Gwyn Macfarlane was a clinical pathologist who helped with the clinical trials at the Radcliffe Infirmary.  He became a great admirer of Florey, writing a biography in 1979: Howard Florey, The Making of a Great Scientist.  \"Florey was a rough, tough Australian, completely uncompromising, rather prickly, very energetic and tense as a coiled spring.  And he brought to his work this extraordinary dedication which was very infectious, in such a way that he really could collect a team of people who became almost as dedicated and enthusiastic as himself. \" Robert Gwyn Macfarlane Clinical Pathologist, Radcliffe Hospital Penicillin Helps the War Effort In 1943, Florey travelled to North Africa to carry out penicillin trials on war wounds.  By the wars end, penicillin had saved the lives of tens of thousands of allied soldiers.  Florey did not patent penicillin or any aspect of its production, believing it would be unethical.  Nobel Prizes Florey, Alexander Fleming, and Ernst Chain were awarded equal shares of the 1945 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine: \"for the discovery of penicillin and its curative effect in various infectious diseases. \" Penicillin - Who to Thank? When it became apparent that penicillin was a wonder drug, Alexander Flemings employer, Londons St Marys Hospital, made sure its link to penicillin was highly publicized - good publicity helped bring in donations from the public.  In its pursuit of publicity, the hospital received valuable help from one of its benefactors, Lord Beaverbrook, the owner of several major British newspapers.  Fleming was more than happy to speak to the press about his work.  Florey, however, instructed his team members not to speak to the press under any circumstances.  He knew that only tiny amounts of penicillin were available and he did not want to raise the publics expectations of a miracle cure.  In the worlds eyes, Fleming became the big name associated with penicillin.  Florey and Chains crucial roles in turning Flemings discovery into an antibiotic drug were understated - a situation that did not change when the Nobel Prize was shared between the three scientists.  In 1998, Professor Sir Henry Harris, who succeeded Florey as Oxfords Chair of Pathology captured the situation in a nutshell, also praising the often unsung Norman Heatley: \". . . without Fleming, no Florey or Chain, without Chain no Florey, without Florey no Heatley, without Heatley no penicillin. \" Honors Florey received a large number of honors, including: 1941: Elected as fellow of the Royal Society 1944: Knighted, becoming Sir Howard Florey 1945: Lister Medal 1945: Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1945: Berzelius Medal (Sweden) 1946: Legion dhonneur (France) 1947: Medal of Merit (USA) 1946: Albert Medal 1948: British Medical Association Gold Medal 1951: Royal Medal 1957: Copley Medal 1960: Elected as president of the Royal Society 1960: Wilhelm Exner Medal (Austria) 1965: Lomonosov Gold Medal (USSR) 1965: Life Peerage, becoming Baron Florey of Adelaide and Marston \"I should like to stress that this work could not have been carried through had it not been for the unremitting labours of the following people: Dr.  Chain, Dr.  Abraham, Prof.  Gardner, Dr.  Heatley, Dr.  Jennings, Dr.  Sanders, Dr.  Fletcher, and Lady Florey. \" Howard Florey British Medical Journal, Aug 1944 \"I should like to stress that this work could not have been carried through had it not been for the unremitting labours of the following people: Dr.  Chain, Dr.  Abraham, Prof.  Gardner, Dr.  Heatley, Dr.  Jennings, Dr.  Sanders, Dr.  Fletcher, and Lady Florey. \" Further Information and The End In October 1926, Florey married Dr.  Mary Ethel Hayter Reed.  They had met as students in Australia and she joined him in London.  They had a daughter and a son: Paquita and Charles.  Mary, a pathologist, played a major role in the first big clinical trial of penicillin in 1942.  In 1952, she began publishing her book The Clinical Application of Antibiotics, in four volumes.  Florey enjoyed classical music, gardening, photography and shooting home movies.  In his late 50s he took up oil painting.  In 1962, age 64, Florey retired from scientific research, becoming Provost of Queens College, Oxford.  In 1966, his wife Mary died.  In 1967, Florey married Margaret Jennings, a member of his original penicillin team.  Howard Florey died at age 69 of a heart attack on February 21, 1968 in Oxford - he had suffered from angina for a number of years.  Survived by his children and second wife, he was buried in Oxfords St.  Nicholas Churchyard.  A month after his death, a memorial service was held for him in Westminster Abbey.  \"Florey had planned the attack [on penicillin], but he was always embarrassed by praise which did not extend to all of his colleagues.  He wished to be counted as one of a group who were sharing a common adventure.  But those who have known him well cannot really believe that Floreys persistent drive and inspiring courage had not made him the central figure who led the successful attack.  \" Edgar Adrian, Nobel Prize for Physiology 1932 Memorial Service for Florey, March 28, 1968 Advertisements Author of this page: The Doc Images digitally enhanced and colorized by this website.

", "article_2": "Howard Walter Florey (1898-1968) and Ernst Boris Chain (1906-1979) were the scientists who followed up most successfully on Alexander Flemings discovery of penicillin, sharing with him the 1945 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.  Florey and Chain each brought scientific knowledge and talent to the effort that filled out the others contribution, but the two were mismatched in terms of their personalities.  Floreys Early Life and Education Florey was born in Adelaide, Australia, the youngest of five children and the only son of an English shoemaker who had immigrated to Australia hoping to save his first wife and two eldest daughters, who were suffering from tuberculosis.  He established a boot and shoe factory, which prospered during much of Floreys youth.  From an early age Florey knew that he wanted to study medicine, perhaps because an older sister was already a medical student.  She teased him about wanting to become \"another Pasteur\" (see Louis Pasteur), thus forecasting his interest in medical research.  In 1922 he graduated with degrees in science and medicine from the University of Adelaide, which at that time specialized in preparing general practitioners, not researchers.  On the basis of his fine academic record and his prowess as a tennis player, he was awarded a prestigious Rhodes Scholarship to study at Oxford University in England.  At Oxford his hunger for research was fed at the Honours Physiology School, which was headed by the great neurophysiologist Sir Charles Sherrington.  After completing his scholarship Florey spent a summer as the physician on an Arctic expedition and the following year as a research student at Cambridge University.  He then accepted a fellowship from the Rockefeller Foundation in New York that enabled him to work in the laboratory of American pharmacologist Alfred Newton Richards at the University of Pennsylvania.  Soon after he returned to England, he began working toward a PhD in pathology at Cambridge.  There he was inspired by the biochemist Sir Frederick Gowland Hopkins, head of the Sir William Dunn Institute of Biochemistry and famous for his work on vitamins.  Florey also worked with Albert Szent-Gyorgyi, who was trying to isolate vitamin C.  The Penicillin Project After holding the first few positions in his career as an academic, he returned to Oxford in 1936 as the director of the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology.  There he recruited an interdisciplinary group of scientists, a choice that reflected the various approaches to disease to which his education had exposed him--studies not just of the pathological evidence of disease but also of the physiological processes by which those symptoms arose, traced to the chemical and even the molecular levels.  By 1940 Florey had assembled a professional staff of about a dozen scientists plus technicians to work on the penicillin project alone.  Among his first hires was the biochemist Ernst Chain, who came highly recommended by Frederick Hopkins at Cambridge and who was charged with developing a biochemical unit within the Dunn School.  Chain: Scientific Genius Chain, a recent immigrant to England, was of Russian-German-Jewish descent.  He was quite confident in his own ability and had a volatile temperament that was bound to clash with Floreys similarly quick temper.  When Chain was only 13, his father, an industrial chemist, died.  The familys economic status declined precipitously, causing his mother to convert their home into a guest house.  The fathers influence lived on in the son, however, and Chain chose a scientific course of studies, graduating in chemistry and physiology from Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin in 1930.  After completing his degree he worked at premier German research institutes--briefly at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry and then in the chemical department of the Pathology Institute at Charite Hospital in Berlin, where he obtained his doctorate.  Chain left his native Berlin for England in 1933, as soon as the Nazis came to power, leaving behind his mother and sister (who would both perish in the Holocaust).  From childhood Chains musical gifts were comparable to his scientific genius, and at virtually every career decision point through his 20s--even after he came to England--he entertained the possibility of becoming a professional pianist instead of a scientist.  chain1-profile2. jpg Ernst Chain.  National Library of Medicine, Images from the History of Medicine (IHM) collection The first job offer in response to his many letters of application in his new country came from the chemical pathology department at University College Hospital Medical School, London.  Chain took the position but quickly alienated himself from the rest of the department, partly through his endless complaints about the low quality of laboratory equipment in comparison with the situations he had known in Germany.  Chain then worked at Cambridge under Floreys mentor Hopkins from 1933 to 1935 before coming to work with Florey at Oxford.  Purifying Penicillin One of the projects pursued at the Dunn School was the crystallization of lysozyme--an enzyme discovered by Alexander Fleming in 1921 with antibacterial properties--and the characterization of its substrate--the location on bacteria to which it usually attaches.  In 1938, while the lysozyme research was concluding and during a rare period of great camaraderie, Florey and Chain decided to study the biochemical and biological properties of selected antibacterial substances produced by certain microorganisms--among them penicillin.  They mistakenly thought these substances were all enzymes like lysozyme.  While Florey and Chain were assembling grants to support their research, work was begun on penicillin.  Chain, along with another chemist, Edward Penley Abraham, worked out a successful technique for purifying and concentrating penicillin.  The keys seemed to lie in controlling the pH of the \"juice,\" reducing the samples temperature, and evaporating the product over and over (essentially freeze-drying it).  In this early process many gallons of mold broth were used to produce an amount just large enough to cover a fingernail.  This excruciatingly inefficient process was later improved on by Norman Heatley--another biochemist on the research team assembled by Florey--and a succession of other scientists.  Testing Penicillin In March 1940 Chain ran down to a laboratory that maintained test animals and requested that two mice be injected with a sample of the penicillin he and Abraham had extracted.  Though the injection represented a far higher dosage than that administered in Flemings similar experiment, the mice survived apparently unharmed; the more concentrated penicillin had passed its first toxicity test.  Florey then directed that the antibacterial properties of penicillin in mice be tested--the crucial step that Fleming had not taken.  On May 25 eight mice were injected with hemolytic streptococci (which among other diseases causes puerperal fever in new mothers), and four of these were subsequently injected with measured and timed doses of penicillin.  Sixteen-and-a-half hours later the four mice that had received penicillin were alive, but their untreated fellows were dead--a finding that caused great excitement among the researchers.  Further testing involving hundreds of mice was carried out through the summer.  On August 24, 1940, Florey and Chain reported their findings in the Lancet; the article electrified research groups around the world that were seeking cures for bacterial disease.  By then World War II had already engulfed Europe, and the military importance of a more successful means of combating the diseases and infections that had decimated armies of the past was immediately recognized.  In early January 1941 Florey was ready to test penicillin on humans.  The first English patient to whom the drug was administered was a young woman whose cancer was beyond treatment and who had agreed to test penicillins toxicity.  She showed an alarming reaction--trembling and sharply rising fever.  However, Abraham was able to show that impurities in the drug, not the drug itself, had caused the adverse reaction.  In February a policeman became the first patient with an infection to be treated with penicillin in the hope of achieving a cure.  No one knew the dosages and the length of treatment required to eliminate various bacterial infections; these parameters were being worked out by just such trials--primitive by todays standards.  The policemans condition at first improved with the penicillin therapy and then relapsed.  The penicillin supply had almost run out, and even retrieving penicillin from the mans own urine (a commonly used procedure in the early clinical trials) failed to save him.  Florey vowed that from then on he would always have enough penicillin to complete a treatment.  Production and Scaling Up Increasing production and yields now became of overriding importance.  Because Penicillium mold requires air to grow, it was first surface-cultured in regular laboratory flasks.  Soon all manner of vessels were being used, including hospital bedpans and hundreds of made-to-order ceramic pots.  The operation quickly outgrew the space assigned to the Dunn labs, and neighboring facilities at Oxford were borrowed for the duration.  More personnel had to be hired, including six \"penicillin girls\" who handled the culture pots in the cold room of the extraction plant.  Florey had constructed a veritable penicillin factory within the precincts of the ancient university, an institution that had stood proudly aloof from industry for centuries.  But when Chain urged that a patent be sought on penicillin, as was usual in German research institutes, Florey refused to enter into such a commercial agreement on a discovery he presumed would benefit all mankind--a decision that long rankled Chain.  To increase penicillin supplies, Florey approached various British pharmaceutical firms, but only ICI considered itself in a position to accept the challenge (though many later joined the effort).  British pharmaceutical firms were already committed to manufacturing other drugs needed for military and civilian populations, or, worse, their facilities had been devastated by enemy bombardment.  To obtain the assistance of the United States, then still a noncombatant, in increasing production and furthering research, Florey and Heatley flew across the Atlantic in the beginning of July 1941.  The American Connection Floreys American connections served him well.  The two English emissaries spent the Fourth of July weekend with a friend from his Rhodes year, who put Florey and Heatley in contact with the U. S.  Department of Agricultures Northern Regional Research Laboratories (NRRL) in Peoria, Illinois, where large-scale fermentation processes were being actively studied.  A.  N.  Richards, Floreys old laboratory director at the University of Pennsylvania, had become chair of the Committee on Medical Research in the Office of Scientific Research and Development, which was organized to marshal the strength of the Allies.  Because Richards knew Floreys character, he decided to expedite unified action on penicillin on the basis of just one presentation.  At the height of the program the British-American penicillin effort involved thousands of people and some 35 institutions: university chemistry and physics departments, government agencies, research foundations, and pharmaceutical companies.  In mid-September, Florey flew back to England to lead the clinical trials that eventually took him as far afield as North Africa and the Soviet Union (then one of the Allies).  Heatley stayed at the NRRL and later moved to Merck and Company in Rahway, New Jersey, to help iron out problems in scaling up penicillin production.  Synthesizing Penicillin Some chemists were confident that they would soon be able to synthesize penicillin from a few organic chemicals.  This attitude resulted in a major effort conducted on both sides of the Atlantic to understand the structure of the penicillin molecule as the prerequisite for its eventual synthesis.  At Oxford the problem of determining penicillins structure was given to Chain, Abraham, and Robert Robinson, a senior organic chemist already famous for solving the structures and the synthesis of many complex molecules derived from natural substances.  By fall 1943, groups working at Oxford and at Merck had proposed two different structures for the atomic groups central to the penicillin molecule.  One proposal--advanced by Chain and Abraham, as well as by Robert Burns Woodward at Harvard University--held that a four-membered beta-lactam ring lay at the heart of the penicillin molecule.  Robinson instead proposed a structure based on oxazolone.  Meanwhile new instrumental techniques for analyzing the structure of organic molecules had become available, including X-ray crystallography, which was practiced by Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin, a near neighbor of the Oxford chemists.  In 1945 she was able to provide physical evidence confirming Chain and Abrahams deduction and countering Robinsons proposed structure.  Unfortunately, Hodgkins work on the molecule culminated too late in World War II to be used in devising a synthesis for penicillin.  Even after 1957, when such a synthesis was created, fermentation continued to underlie the commercial production of penicillin and related antibiotics.  But the structural knowledge gained in the war years proved invaluable in developing penicillin-like antibiotics after the war that could be administered more conveniently, were more effective, and had fewer side effects.  florey1-profile1. jpg Howard Florey.  National Library of Medicine, Images from the History of Medicine (IHM) collection With World War II over and the Nobel Prizes distributed to Fleming, Florey, and Chain for their work on penicillin, Florey continued to lead the lab at the Dunn School along the promising path of research into antibiotics.  One of his groups most famous accomplishments was the development of cephalosporin C in 1954.  In this case Florey immediately urged its patenting.  In 1962 Florey became provost of Queens College, Oxford, and from 1960 to 1965 he held one of the worlds most prestigious scientific positions, the presidency of the Royal Society.  To remedy the deficiencies of Australian higher education as he had experienced it, he helped organize the Australian National University in Canberra as a postgraduate-level university, and in 1965 he became its chancellor.  Chain and Later Projects After World War II, Chain was eager to leave Oxford.  Of the several career moves he considered, he ultimately chose the Istituto Superiore di Sanita in Rome.  There he productively combined a biochemical research department and a fermentation pilot plant.  In 1957 a consulting relationship with a group of scientists from the Beecham Group, who came to Rome especially to benefit from Chains biochemical insights and the facilities there, resulted in the isolation of the atomic groupings central to the penicillin molecule.  Knowing how to produce this \"nucleus\" by natural processes, researchers could move on to the commercial production of all kinds of semisynthetic penicillins, such as penicillin V and ampicillin.  In 1964 Chain returned to England to head a new biochemistry department at Imperial College, London, which he specified would include a fermentation pilot plant as one of its facilities.  Always a person of many interests and projects, in this later period of his life, Chain made considerable efforts to promote respect for Jewish traditions.

", "article_3": "While Alexander Fleming is often credited with discovering penicillin in 1928, Howard Walter Florey oversaw initial clinical trials and led the team that first produced large quantities of this antibiotic, which played an important role in the Allied victory in World War II.  But the antibacterial activity of penicillin was first discovered decades before Fleming's or Florey's work.  Ernest A. C.  Duchesne, a young military physician in Lyons, France, discovered penicillin in 1897 during a thesis project investigating antagonism between bacteria and fungi.  On the advice of his mentor, Professor Gabriel Roux, Duchesne inoculated guinea pigs with various bacteria and then injected them with either the broth of a Penicillium glaucum culture or saline.  Most of the animals injected with the culture broth survived, while those given saline died.  Duchesne's thesis was not noticed by the Institut Pasteur, and he entered the French Army and was unable to continue his research.  Penicillin remained unknown until Fleming left several bacterial culture plates on a laboratory bench, allegedly before leaving for his 1928 summer holiday.  Fleming claimed that upon his return, he examined the culture plates and noted, \"Around a large colony of a contaminating mold, the staphylococcus colonies became transparent and had obviously undergone lysis. \" He subsequently carried out experiments with animals and then human conjunctivae, but had difficulty extracting adequate amounts of penicillin from culture and abandoned this work.  Large-scale production of penicillin was developed by Florey and German-born British biochemist Ernst B.  Chain more than a decade later.  Florey was born in Adelaide, South Australia, on September 26, 1898, the youngest of five children.  His father was a manager for a shoe manufacturing company.  Following education at St.  Peters Collegiate School and the University of Adelaide, where he obtained his MBBS degree in 1921, Florey was selected as a Rhodes Scholar to Magdalen College at Oxford in 1922.  In Oxford, he developed a close friendship with John Fulton, an American Rhodes Scholar.  This friendship played an important role in the development of penicillin decades later.  Florey initially studied inflammation, including work on lysozyme and gastrointestinal secretion of mucus.  He married a fellow medical student from Adelaide, Mary Ethel Reed, in 1926.  Their daughter, Paquita, was so named because of his time in Spain studying nerve staining in the laboratory of Ramon y Cajal.  An appointment in the Department of Pathology at Cambridge resulted in obtaining his PhD in 1927, with a dissertation on the physiology and pathology of the circulation of blood and lymph.  He was appointed Chair of Pathology at the University of Sheffield in 1932 and two years later accepted the position of Chair of Pathology at Oxford.  Florey wanted to pursue biochemical work in his laboratory and hired Chain upon the recommendation of Frederick Gowland Hopkins, the Cambridge biochemist who was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1929 for co-discovery of vitamins.  At Floreys suggestion, Chain began studying lysozyme and in 1938 became aware of Flemings work on penicillin.  After reproducing Duchesne's experiments in animals, Florey and Chain began making penicillin in porcelain vessels.  The first patient treated with penicillin in January 1941 was an Oxford policeman with cellulitis, abscesses, and osteomyelitis due to a scratch from a rose thorn, who improved with drug therapy but relapsed when the supply of penicillin was exhausted.  Five additional patients were treated over the next three months and the impressive results were reported by Florey in the Lancet in August 1941.  Florey approached a British pharmaceutical firm to make more penicillin but this was not possible during wartime in England.  Although Fleming had abandoned his work on penicillin years earlier, he heard via the grapevine that Florey was working on penicillin at Oxford so he visited his laboratory.  He was graciously received by Florey and returned to London, but did not participate in further studies.  Whereas Florey was abrasive or avoided the media, Fleming was always available to talk to the press, which almost led to Fleming receiving the Nobel Prize for penicillin alone.  Since it was not possible to produce enough penicillin for a clinical trial in England, Florey and a young English biochemist, Norman Heatley, traveled to the United States in June 1941.  They visited Florey's old friend Fulton, who by then was a professor of physiology at Yale University.  Since large fermentation tanks would be needed, Fulton made the connections necessary for Florey and Heatley to visit the Northern Regional Research Laboratory of the US Department of Agriculture in Peoria, Illinois.  Utilizing a new fungal source from a spoiled cantaloupe in a Peoria market, new culture media and fermentation in large tanks resulted in the production of larger amounts of penicillin.  The first patient to be treated with penicillin in the United States was Anne Sheafe Miller, wife of the Athletic Director at Yale.  Her severe streptococcal sepsis was treated in March 1942, which resulted in a complete recovery.  She lived until the age of 90.  Florey and his wife Ethel then conducted a successful clinical trial utilizing penicillin, and subsequently the drug became widely used in both civilian and military hospitals.  Chain strongly advised obtaining a patent, but Florey emphasized that they should not be concerned with monetary awards and should make penicillin available for patients.  He was knighted in 1944 and received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Fleming and Chain in 1945.  Subsequently, Florey became Provost of Queens College (Oxford) and relinquished his position as Chair of Pathology.  He became President of the Royal Society in 1960 and was responsible for obtaining new quarters for the Society at Carleton House Terrace.  He established the John Curtin School of Medical Research in the Australian National University in Canberra in 1965, the same year he was created Baron of Adelaide in Australia and Marston in England.  He never lost his Australian accent and retained his emotional ties with his native country, despite living in England for more than four decades.  Florey was known as a man of vision, energy, and persistence who also was modest and realistic about his abilities and honors.  He said, \"We had a bit of luck with penicillin-a great deal of luck. \" He worked seven days weekly, and technicians were not anxious to work in his laboratory.  He struggled against administrative duties and always wished to devote more time to laboratory research.  To young investigators, he often seemed a remote and formidable figure.  His wife Ethel died in 1966, and the following year he married Margaret Jennings, who had worked in his laboratory for over 40 years.  He became a heavy cigarette smoker during World War II and developed progressive angina during the last 18 years of his life.  He died suddenly in Oxford on February 21, 1968, and was honored by a stamp issued by Australia in 1995 (Scott #1461D).  Florey's portrait also appeared on the Australian $50 banknote from 1973-95.

His early education was at St.  Peters Collegiate School, Adelaide, following which he went on to Adelaide University where he graduated M. B. , B. S.  in 1921.  He was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford, leading to the degrees of B. Sc.  and M. A.  (1924).  He then went to Cambridge as a John Lucas Walker Student.  In 1925 he visited the United States on a Rockefeller Travelling Fellowship for a year, returning in 1926 to a Fellowship at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, receiving here his Ph. D.  in 1927.  He also held at this time the Freedom Research Fellowship at the London Hospital.  In 1927 he was appointed Huddersfield Lecturer in Special Pathology at Cambridge.  In 1931 he succeeded to the Joseph Hunter Chair of Pathology at the University of Sheffield.  Leaving Sheffield in 1935 he became Professor of Pathology and a Fellow of Lincoln College, Oxford.  He was made an Honorary Fellow of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge in 1946 and an Honorary Fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford in 1952.  In 1962 he was made Provost of The Queens College, Oxford.  During World War II he was appointed Honorary Consultant in Pathology to the Army and in 1944 he became Nuffield Visiting Professor to Australia and New Zealand.  His best-known work dates from his collaboration with Chain, which began in 1938 when they conducted a systematic investigation of the properties of naturally occurring antibacterial substances.  Lysozyme, an antibacterial substance found in saliva and human tears, was their original interest, but their interest moved to substances now known as antibiotics.  The work on penicillin was a result of this interest.  Penicillin had been discovered by Fleming in 1928 as a result of observations on a mould which developed on some germ culture plates but the active substance was not isolated.  In 1939, Florey and Chain headed a team of British scientists, financed by a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation, whose efforts led to the successful small-scale manufacture of the drug from the liquid broth in which it grows.  In 1940 a report was issued describing how penicillin had been found to be a chemotherapeutic agent capable of killing sensitive germs in the living body.  Thereafter great efforts were made, with government assistance, to enable sufficient quantities of the drug to be made for use in World War II to treat war wounds.  Florey was a contributor to, and Editor of, Antibiotics (1949).  He was also part-author of a book of lectures on general pathology and has had many papers published on physiology and pathology.  Dr.  Florey has had many honours bestowed upon him.  Among these may be mentioned the Lister Medal of the Royal College of Surgeons, the Berzelius Medal of the Swedish Medical Society, the Royal and Copley Medals of the Royal Society, the Medal of Merit of the U.  S.  Army, and many others.  He is President of the Royal Society since 1960 and a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, and among other honorary fellowships he holds is that of the Royal Australian College of Physicians.  He has been awarded honorary degrees by seventeen universities and is a member or honorary member of many learned societies and academies in the field of medicine and biology.  In 1944 he was created a Knight Bachelor.  He married Mary Ethel Hayter Reed in 1926.  They have two children, Paquita Mary Joanna and Charles du Ve.

One of the prosecuting counsels at the Nuremberg Trials, he subsequently played a role in drafting the European Convention on Human Rights.  As Home Secretary he led a crackdown against homosexuals in the UK in the 1950s, and refused to commute Derek Bentley's death sentence for the murder of a police officer.  His political ambitions were ultimately dashed in Harold Macmillan's cabinet reshuffle of July 1962. Born in Edinburgh, the only son of William Thomson Fyfe, Headmaster of Aberdeen Grammar School, by his second wife Isabella Campbell, daughter of David Campbell, of Dornoch, co.  Sutherland, he was educated at George Watson's College and Balliol College, Oxford, where, perhaps owing to his interest in politics, he achieved a third-class degree in Greats.  Whilst at Oxford, he was a member of the Stubbs Society.  His academic education was paused during his service in the Scots Guards in 1918-19, at the end of the World War I. After graduation, he worked for the British Commonwealth Union as political secretary to Sir Patrick Hannon MP, studying law in his spare time.  He entered Gray's Inn and was called to the bar in 1922.  He became a pupil of George Lynskey in Liverpool then joined his chambers to practise. Not pausing before beginning his political career in earnest, he stood as a Conservative for Wigan in 1924, an unwinnable parliamentary seat.  He cultivated the more winnable Spen Valley until 1929 when the party resolved not to oppose sitting Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) Sir John Simon while he was absent on the Simon Commission in India.  Maxwell Fyfe was eventually elected to Parliament in Liverpool West Derby in a by-election in July 1935. Meanwhile, Maxwell Fyfe's legal career had prospered.  In 1934 he became King's Counsel. He was Recorder of Oldham from 1936 to 1942. Maxwell Fyfe, along with Patrick Spens, Derrick Gunston and others, backed the National Government over the Hoare-Laval Pact, and he supported Neville Chamberlain over the Munich Agreement.  However, after the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in March 1939, Maxwell Fyfe joined the Territorial Army and, at the outbreak of World War II in September, he was deployed to the Judge Advocate-General's department with rank of major.  He was badly injured in an air raid in September 1940.  In May 1941 Maxwell Fyfe became deputy to Rab Butler's chairmanship of a Conservative Party committee to analyse forthcoming post-war problems, taking over from Butler in July 1943. Sir David Maxwell Fyfe (centre) and an unknown prosecutor at the Nuremberg trials In March 1942, Sir Winston Churchill, on the advice of Brendan Bracken, appointed Maxwell Fyfe Solicitor-General.  At the same time he was knighted and sworn of the Privy Council.  He applied himself to his work in the wartime coalition government with enormous industry and began some of the thinking and planning about how the leaders of the Nazi regime in Germany might be brought to account after the war.  As part of his duties, on 8 April 1945, he attended an Anglo-American discussion over the war crimes trial, at which, says the historian Richard Overy, \"he presented the standard British argument for summary execution. \" Whether Maxwell Fyfe believed such executions were the best method of dealing with the Nazis may be doubted, in view of his later work at the Nuremberg Trials; at the time, however, as a member of the government he had little choice but to follow the lead of the Prime Minister, Churchill, who repeatedly urged that summary justice be visited upon the Nazi leaders. When the war in Europe ended and the coalition was dissolved in May 1945, Maxwell Fyfe was briefly Attorney-General in Churchill's caretaker government. The Labour Party won a landslide victory in the United Kingdom general election of 1945 and Sir Hartley Shawcross became Attorney General and took responsibility as Britain's chief prosecutor in the Nuremberg Trials.  Shawcross, to emphasise the non-partisan nature of the trials, appointed Maxwell Fyfe his deputy.  Shawcross was largely committed to his political duties in Westminster and played little part other than delivering the opening and closing speeches.  Maxwell Fyfe took on most of the day-to-day responsibilities as \"capable lawyer, efficient administrator and concerned housemaster\". There were misgivings in some quarters as to how Fyfe would perform, cross-examination not being regarded as one of his strengths.  However, his cross-examination of Hermann Goring was one of the most noted cross-examinations in history. After Nuremberg, Maxwell Fyfe returned to Parliament to shadow the Minister of Labour while simultaneously pursuing a full, busy and prominent career at the Bar, for example defending serial murderer John George Haigh in 1949.  Reputedly, he would arrive at the House of Commons at around 5. 00 pm, often stay throughout debates that lasted all night then, after a quick shave and breakfast, leave for court.  He was ably assisted in his punishing schedule by his wife Sylvia, herself a Conservative Party worker. Maxwell Fyfe played a leading role in drafting the party's Industrial Charter of 1947 and chaired the committee into Conservative Party organisation that resulted in the Maxwell Fyfe Report (1948-49).  The report shifted the balance of electoral funding from the candidate to the party, with the intention of broadening the diversity of MPs.  In practice, it may have had the effect of lending more power to constituency parties and making candidates more uniform. He was a notable Conservative supporter of Labour's British Nationality Act 1948, which reaffirmed the rights of Commonwealth citizens to enter Britain without restriction, showing a commitment to the unity and indivisibility of the empire. [citation needed] Maxwell Fyfe was a champion of European integration and a member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe from August 1949 to May 1952, becoming the Chair of the Assembly's Committee on Legal and Administrative Questions, and rapporteur on the committee drafting the European Convention on Human Rights.  In his memoirs he criticised Sir Anthony Eden for a negative stance that derailed the UK's opportunity to become a leader in Europe.  Eden always rejected this and considered a libel action against Maxwell Fyfe. Home Secretary  Shortly before the United Kingdom general election of 1951, Maxwell Fyfe caused a stir when he appeared to hint in a radio interview that a Conservative government might legislate to curb the power of trade unions.  When the Conservative Party was returned to power in the election, Churchill thought it unwise to appoint him Minister of Labour, and Maxwell Fyfe became both Home Secretary and cabinet minister for Welsh affairs.  He was responsible for guiding several complicated pieces of legislation through the Commons, in particular those that established commercial television.  He gained a reputation as a hard-working, thorough and reliable cabinet member. In 1952, the Director General of MI5 (DG) was made directly answerable to the Home Secretary rather than the Prime Minister.  Given this novel responsibility, Maxwell Fyfe issued the Maxwell Fyfe Directive which became the de facto constitution of the Security Service until the Security Service Act 1989 set it on a statutory basis. When Sir Percy Sillitoe resigned as DG in 1953, Maxwell Fyfe delegated the shortlisting of a successor to a committee of civil servants chaired by Sir Edward Bridges.  The committee put forward Dick White and Sir Kenneth Strong.  Maxwell Fyfe endorsed the committee's preference for White, observing to Churchill that an internal appointment would be good for the morale of the service. Fyfe's assumption of office as Home Secretary heralded a reign of fear for male homosexuals.  A stern advocate of existing legislation criminalising homosexual acts, he started a campaign to \"rid England of this male vice . . .  this plague\" by dramatically increased arrests of male homosexuals through police surveillance and entrapment via the use of agents provocateurs, tapped telephones, forged documents and the absence of warrants. From 1,276 in prosecutions in 1939 for actual or attempted sodomy or gross indecency, a year after he had assumed the office of Home Secretary prosecutions had soared to 5,443. Fyfe subsequently sanctioned the establishment of the Wolfenden Report into homosexuality, but had he known its findings would recommend decriminalisation, it is unlikely he would have done so. [citation needed] A conservative on the death penalty, Kilmuir was likewise conservative on the issue of homosexual rights, and led the opposition in the House of Lords to the implementation of the Wolfenden Committee report, which had recommended the decriminalisation of homosexual acts between consenting adults.  This was ironic, says Geraldine Bedell, since it was he, while Home Secretary, who had set up the committee to consider whether the law should be changed. As Bedell also notes: \"Perhaps he thought, by handing over to a committee, to shelve the issue.  Perhaps he assumed Wolfenden would find against, in which case, he chose a curious chairman, because Wolfenden had a gay son, Jeremy. \" Kilmuir still opposed liberalisation when a bill was introduced in the Lords (by Lord Arran) in 1965.  Says Bedell: \"For the opposition, Lord Kilmuir warned against licensing the 'buggers' clubs' which he claimed were operating behind innocent-looking doors all over London. \" Maxwell Fyfe told the Conservative backbencher Sir Robert Boothby, who was known in parliamentary circles to be bisexual, that it was not his intention to legalise homosexuality: \"I am not going down in history\", he told Boothby, \"as the man who made sodomy legal. \" During his tenure as Home Secretary, he was embroiled in the controversy surrounding the hanging of Derek Bentley. Maxwell Fyfe had controversially refused to grant a reprieve to Bentley despite the written petitions of 200 MPs and the claim that Bentley was mentally retarded allegedly having a mental age of only 11. However, on most issues he was on the progressive wing of the Conservative Party, opposing the proposals in 1953 for the re-introduction of corporal punishment. Maxwell Fyfe remained ambitious and a Daily Mirror opinion poll in 1954, on the popular favourite to succeed Churchill as Party leader and prime minister, had him behind Eden and Butler but well ahead of Macmillan.  However, once it was clear that Eden was to be Churchill's successor, he sought the office of Lord Chancellor. On 19 October 1954 he was raised to the peerage as Viscount Kilmuir, of Creich in the County of Sutherland, and moved to the House of Lords and the \"woolsack\".  Lord Kilmuir was a political Lord Chancellor, not restricting himself to his judicial role.  He worked on many government issues including the constitution of Malta, which he wanted to become part of the UK, and the creation of the Restrictive Practices Court.  In his eight years in the post he only sat as a judge on 24 appeals to the House of Lords.  Lord Kilmuir opposed Sydney Silverman's 1956 private member's bill to abolish capital punishment.  He described it as \"an unwise and dangerous measure, the presence of which on the statute book would be a disaster for the country and a menace to the people\".  However, Kilmuir chaired the cabinet committee that recommended limiting the death penalty's scope and which led to the Homicide Act 1957.  He feared the consequences of immigration to the United Kingdom and presented a report to the cabinet in 1956.  Lord Kilmuir contended that the military intervention in the 1956 Suez Crisis was justified under the self-defence provisions of Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. He continued in this office in the governments of Anthony Eden and Harold Macmillan until Macmillan's 1962 \"Night of the Long Knives\", when he was abruptly replaced by Sir Reginald Manningham-Buller, the Attorney-General.  Kilmuir was made Baron Fyfe of Dornoch, of Dornoch in the County of Sutherland, and Earl of Kilmuir on 20 July 1962 to cushion the blow of retirement. He is said to have complained to Macmillan that he was being sacked with less notice than would be given to a cook, to which Macmillan replied that it was easier to get Lord Chancellors than good cooks. After government, Kilmuir joined the board of directors of Plessey but his health soon declined.  He died at Withyham, Sussex, on 27 January 1967 and was cremated.  His ashes were buried at the church of St Michael and All Angels at Withyham.  His wealth at death was PS22,202.  His titles, which could pass only to sons, became extinct, as he had fathered only daughters. He married Sylvia Harrison in 1925 and they had three daughters, one of whom pre-deceased him.

Kilmuir was a formidable parliamentary presence on behalf of his party, and his remarkable memory compensated for a dull speaking style, though he was capable of passion when the circumstances were right.  In appearance, \"His body was pear-shaped, and beneath a large square bald head there were dark heavy eyebrows and a face of middle-eastern pallor and swarthiness\". As Home Secretary, he often travelled to Wales, and in the valleys of South Wales he was nicknamed Dai Bananas, Fyffes being, then as now, one of Britain's major importers of the fruit.

(Photo by Monty Fresco/Topical Press Agency/Getty Images) Now some 75 years after he played a leading role in the Nuremberg War Trials by rigorously questioning Hermann Goering, the family of one of Scotlands most acclaimed legal minds is to pay tribute to his life and achievements.  Sir David Maxwell Fyfe served as Britains deputy chief prosecutor during the historic trials, conducting cross-examinations which to this day are regarded as among the most significant in modern jurisprudence.  The politician and barrister, born in Aberdeen and raised in Edinburgh, spent a year reviewing Nazi atrocities for the trials, an experience that spurred him on to help compose the first draft of what would become the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR).  With Britain now bowing out of the grand European project Sir David helped create, his relatives hope to inform a new generation about his remarkable legal legacy.  Dreams Of Peace And Freedom, a multimedia show that weaves together the Scots words with poetry and music, is the brainchild of his grandson, Tom Blackmore, a theatre director.  Together withnhis wife, Sue Casson, a composer, and Sir Davids great-grandchildren, Lily Casson and Robert Blackmore, the family will embark on a UK tour later this year, including performances in Edinburgh and Dornoch.  Advertisement Hide Ad According to Lily, a singer and actor, growing intolerance and anti-Semitism across Europe \"shows why we must remember what happened in the past to stop it from being repeated\".  She explained: \"The show is a way of keeping a forgotten piece of history alive for new generations to discover.  Very few people of my generation know about it. \" The show recounts the horror felt by Sir David as he pored over the evidence, including 19 minutes video footage, shot by Russian forces at Auschwitz in January 1945.  As well as capturing some of the survivors, the video showed the clothes of dead infants and children the same age as Miranda, his then seven-year-old daughter.  Sir David, among the first to view it, was deeply moved and it strengthened his resolve.  In a letter to his wife, Sylvia, Sir David confided: \"It is worth a year of our lives to help to register for ever and with practical result the reasoned horror of humanity. \" Lily added: \"He saw that Nuremberg was a matter of record as well as natural justice.  The shock of the film was the evil, the terror and the brutality, but more that it was planned and justified. \" Advertisement Hide Ad The performances also touch on other aspects of Sir Davids remarkable career, which saw him become the youngest Kings Counsel in 250 years when he was appointed at the age of just 34.  A year later, in 1935, he was elected as the Conservative MP for Liverpool West Derby, and by 1942 Winston Churchill named him Solicitor General in his wartime coalition government.  Three years later, he served a brief stint as Attorney General.  Impressive though such positions were, they became footnotes when compared with his achievements at Nuremberg and, later, with the creation of the ECHR.  At the conventions signing on 4 November, 1950, he delivered a rousing speech.  \"Some may say that it is of doubtful value that the democratic nations should reinforce individual liberty among themselves and leave the totalitarian states untouched,\" he said.  \"We do not accept this pessimistic view.  We consider that our light will be a beacon to those at the moment in totalitarian darkness and will give them a hope of return to freedom. \" For Lily, the threats to human rights and liberties in the 21st century mean that reminding the wider world of her great-grandfathers work has never been more important.  Advertisement Hide Ad \"The ECHR was never going to be perfect, but what matters is that it came into existence at all.  Its something that can be built upon, changed, and modified to fit the world as it changes,\" she said.

Nancy Witcher Langhorne was born at the Langhorne House in Danville, Virginia. She was the eighth of eleven children born to railroad businessman Chiswell Dabney Langhorne and Nancy Witcher Keene. Following the abolition of slavery, Chiswell struggled to make his operations profitable, and with the destruction of the war, the family lived in near-poverty for several years before Nancy was born.  After her birth, her father gained a job as a tobacco auctioneer in Danville, the centre of bright leaf tobacco and a major marketing and processing centre.  In 1874, he won a construction contract with the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad, using former contacts from his service in the Civil War.  By 1892, when Nancy was thirteen years old, her father had re-established his wealth and built a sizeable home. Chiswell Langhorne later moved his family to an estate, known as Mirador, in Albemarle County, Virginia.  Nancy Langhorne had four sisters and three brothers who survived childhood.  All of the sisters were known for their beauty; Nancy and her sister Irene both attended a finishing school in New York City.  There Nancy met her first husband, socialite Robert Gould Shaw II, a first cousin of Colonel Robert Gould Shaw, who commanded the 54th Massachusetts Regiment, the first unit in the Union Army to be composed of African Americans.  They married in New York City on 27 October 1897, when she was 18.  The marriage was unhappy.  Shaw's friends said Nancy became puritanical and rigid after marriage; her friends said that Shaw was an abusive alcoholic.  During their four-year marriage, they had one son, Robert Gould Shaw III (called Bobbie).  Nancy left Shaw numerous times during their marriage, the first during their honeymoon.  In 1903, Nancy's mother died; at that time, Nancy Shaw gained a divorce and moved back to Mirador to try to run her father's household, but was unsuccessful. Nancy Shaw took a tour of England and fell in love with the country.  Since she had been so happy there, her father suggested that she move to England.  Seeing she was reluctant, her father said this was also her mother's wish; he suggested she take her younger sister Phyllis.  Nancy and Phyllis moved together to England in 1905.  Their older sister Irene had married the artist Charles Dana Gibson and became a model for his Gibson Girls. Nancy Shaw had already become known in English society as an interesting and witty American, at a time when numerous wealthy young American women had married into the aristocracy.  Her tendency to be saucy in conversation, yet religiously devout and almost prudish in behaviour, confused many of the English men but pleased some of the older socialites.  Nancy also began to show her skill at winning over critics.  She was once asked by an English woman, \"Have you come to get our husbands?\" Her unexpected response, \"If you knew the trouble I had getting rid of mine. . . \" charmed her listeners and displayed the wit for which she became known. Nancy Astor, Viscountess Astor, 1908.  She did marry an Englishman, albeit one born in the United States, Waldorf Astor; when he was twelve, his father, William Waldorf Astor had moved the family to England, raising his children in the English aristocratic style.  The couple were well matched, as they were both American expatriates with similar temperaments.  They were of the same age, and born on the same day, 19 May 1879.  Astor shared some of Nancy's moral attitudes, and had a heart condition that may have contributed to his restraint.  After the marriage, the Astors moved into Cliveden, a lavish estate in Buckinghamshire on the River Thames that was a wedding gift from Astor's father. Nancy Astor developed as a prominent hostess for the social elite. [b] The Astors also owned a grand London house, No.  4 St.  James's Square, now the premises of the Naval & Military Club.  A blue plaque unveiled in 1987 commemorates Astor at St.  James's Square. Through her many social connections, Lady Astor became involved in a political circle called Milner's Kindergarten.  Considered liberal in their age, the group advocated unity and equality among English-speaking people and a continuance or expansion of the British Empire. With Milner's Kindergarten, Astor began her association with Philip Kerr.  The friendship became important in her religious life; they met shortly after Kerr had suffered a spiritual crisis regarding his once devout Catholicism.  They were attracted to Christian Science, to which they both eventually converted. After converting, she began to proselytise for that faith and played a role in Kerr's conversion to it. She also tried to convert Hilaire Belloc's daughters to Christian Science, which led to a rift between them. Despite having Catholic friends such as Belloc for a time, Astor had religious views that included a strong vein of anti-Catholicism. Christopher Sykes argues that Kerr, an ex-Catholic, influenced this, but others argue that Astor's Protestant Virginia origins are a sufficient explanation for her Anti-Catholic views.  (Anti-Catholicism was also tied to historic national rivalries. ) She attempted to discourage the hiring of Jews or Catholics to senior positions at The Observer, a newspaper owned by her husband. In 1927, she reportedly told James Louis Garvin that if he hired a Catholic, \"bishops would be there within a week. Several elements of Viscountess Astor's life influenced her first campaign, but she became a candidate after her husband succeeded to the peerage and House of Lords.  He had enjoyed a promising political career for several years before World War I in the House of Commons; after his father's death, he succeeded to his father's peerage as the 2nd Viscount Astor.  He automatically became a member of the House of Lords and consequently had to forfeit his seat of Plymouth Sutton in the House of Commons. With this change, Lady Astor decided to contest the by-election for the vacant Parliamentary seat.  Astor had not been connected with the women's suffrage movement in the British Isles.  The first woman elected to the British Parliament, Constance Markievicz, said Lady Astor was \"of the upper classes, out of touch\". Countess Markiewicz had been in Holloway prison for Sinn Fein activities during her election, and other suffragettes had been imprisoned for arson.  However, as Astor was met as she arrived at Paddington station on the day after her election by a crowd of suffragettes, including unnamed women who had been imprisoned and on hunger strike, one said, \"This is the beginning of our era.  I am glad to have suffered for this. \" Astor was hampered in the popular campaign for her published and at times vocal teetotalism and her ignorance of current political issues.  Astor appealed to voters on the basis of her earlier work with the Canadian soldiers, allies of the British, charitable work during the war, her financial resources for the campaign and her ability to improvise.  Her audiences appreciated her wit and ability to turn the tables on hecklers.  Once a man asked her what the Astors had done for him and she responded with, \"Why, Charlie, you know,\"[c] and later had a picture taken with him.  This informal style baffled yet amused the British public.  She rallied the supporters of the current government, moderated her Prohibition views, and used women's meetings to gain the support of female voters.  A by-election was held on 28 November 1919, and she took up her seat in the House on 1 December as a Unionist (also known as \"Tory\") Member of Parliament.  Viscountess Astor was not the first woman elected to the Westminster Parliament.  That was achieved by Constance Markievicz, who was the first woman MP elected to Westminster in 1918, but as she was an Irish Republican, she did not take her seat.  As a result, Lady Astor is sometimes erroneously referred to as the first woman MP, or the first woman elected to the U. K.  Parliament, rather than the first woman MP to take her seat in Parliament.  Astor was the first woman to be elected through what has been termed the 'halo effect' of women taking over their husband's parliamentary seat, a process which accounted for the election of ten women MPs (nearly a third of the women elected to parliament) between the two world wars. Astor's Parliamentary career was the most public phase of her life.  She gained attention as a woman and as someone who did not follow the rules, often attributed to her American upbringing.  On her first day in the House of Commons, she was called to order for chatting with a fellow House member, not realising that she was the person who was causing the commotion.  She learned to dress more sedately and avoided the bars and smoking rooms frequented by the men. Early in her first term, MP Horatio Bottomley wanted to dominate the \"soldier's friend\" issue and, believing her to be an obstacle, sought to ruin her political career.  He capitalised on her opposition to divorce reform and her efforts to maintain wartime alcohol restrictions.  Bottomley portrayed her as a hypocrite, as she was divorced.  He said that the reform bill that she opposed would allow women to have the same kind of divorce she had in America.  Bottomley was later imprisoned for fraud, which Astor used to her advantage in other campaigns. Astor made friends among women MPs, including members of the other parties.  Margaret Wintringham was elected after Astor had been in office for two years.  Astor befriended Ellen Wilkinson, a member of the Labour Party (and a former Communist).  Astor later proposed creating a \"Women's Party\", but the female Labour MPs opposed that, as their party was then in office and had promised them positions.  Over time, political differences separated the women MPs; by 1931 Astor became hostile to female Labour members such as Susan Lawrence. Nancy Astor's accomplishments in the House of Commons were relatively minor.  She never held a position with much influence and or any post of ministerial rank although her time in Commons saw four Conservative Prime Ministers in office.  The Duchess of Atholl (elected to Parliament in 1923, four years after Lady Astor) rose to higher levels in the Conservative Party before Astor.  Astor felt if she had more position in the party, she would be less free to criticise her party's government.  During this period, Nancy Astor continued to be active outside government by supporting the development and expansion of nursery schools for children's education.  She was introduced to the issue by socialist Margaret McMillan, who believed that her late sister helped guide her in life.  Lady Astor was initially skeptical of that aspect, but the two women later became close.  Astor used her wealth to aid their social efforts. Although active in charitable efforts, Astor became noted for a streak of cruelty.  On hearing of the death of a political enemy, she expressed her pleasure.  When people complained, she did not apologise but said, \"I'm a Virginian; we shoot to kill. \" Angus McDonnell, a Virginia friend, angered her by marrying without consulting her on his choice.  She later told him, regarding his maiden speech, that he \"really must do better than that. \" During the course of her adult life, Astor alienated many with her sharp words as well. St.  Louis Post-Dispatch Astor as sketched in 1922 by Marguerite Martyn of the During the 1920s, Astor made several effective speeches in Parliament, and gained support for her Intoxicating Liquor (Sale to Persons under 18) Bill (nicknamed \"Lady Astor's Bill\"), raising the legal age for consuming alcohol in a public house from 14 to 18. Her wealth and persona brought attention to women who were serving in government.  She worked to recruit women into the civil service, the police force, education reform, and the House of Lords.  She was well-liked in her constituency, as well as the United States during the 1920s, but her success is generally believed to have declined in the following decades. In May 1922, Astor was guest of honour at a Pan-American conference held by the League of Women Voters in Baltimore, Maryland. Astor became the first President of the newly-formed Electrical Association For Women in 1924. She chaired the first ever International Conference of Women In Science, Industry and Commerce, a three-day event held London in July 1925, organised by Caroline Haslett for the Women's Engineering Society in co-operation with other leading women's groups.  Astor hosted a large gathering at her home in St James's to enable networking amongst the international delegates, and spoke strongly of her support of and the need for women to work in the fields of science, engineering and technology. She was concerned about the treatment of juvenile victims of crime: \"The work of new MPs, such as Nancy Astor, led to a Departmental Committee on Sexual Offences Against Young People, which reported in 1925. The 1930s were a decade of personal and professional difficulty for Lady Astor.  In 1929, she won a narrow victory over the Labour candidate.  In 1931, Bobby Shaw, her son from her first marriage, was arrested for homosexual offences. As her son had previously shown tendencies towards alcoholism and instability, Astor's friend Philip Kerr, now the 11th Marquess of Lothian, suggested the arrest might act as a catalyst for him to change his behaviour, but he was incorrect.  Astor made a disastrous speech stating that alcohol use was the reason for England's national cricket team being defeated by the Australian national cricket team.  Both the English and Australian teams objected to that statement.  Astor remained oblivious to her growing unpopularity almost to the end of her career. Astor's friendship with George Bernard Shaw helped her through some of her problems although his own nonconformity caused friction between them.  They held opposing political views and had very different temperaments.  However, his own tendency to make controversial statements or put her into awkward situations proved to be a drawback for her political career. After Bobby Shaw was arrested, Gertrude Ely, a Pennsylvania Railroad heiress from Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania offered to provide a guided tour to Moscow for Lady Astor and Bobby.  Because of public comments by her and her son during this period, her political career suffered.  Her son made many flattering statements about the Soviet Union, and Astor often disparaged it because she did not approve of communism.  In a meeting, she asked Joseph Stalin directly why he had slaughtered so many Russians, but many of her criticisms were translated as less challenging statements.  Some of her conservative supporters feared she had \"gone soft\" on communism; her question to Stalin may have been translated correctly only because he insisted of being told what she had said.  The Conservatives felt that her son's praise of the Soviet Union served as a coup for its propaganda and so they were unhappy with her tour. Antisemitism, anti-Catholicism, and anticommunism  Astor was reportedly a supporter of the Nazis as a solution to what she saw as the \"world problems\" of Jews and communists. In 1938, she met Joseph P.  Kennedy Sr. , who was a well-documented antisemite.  She asked him not to take offence at her anti-Catholic views and wrote, \"I'm glad you are smart enough not to take my [views] personally\".  She highlighted the fact that she had a number of Catholic friends. Astor and Kennedy's correspondence is reportedly filled with antisemitic language, and Edward J.  Renehan Jr.  wrote: As fiercely anti-Communist as they were anti-Semitic, Kennedy and Astor looked upon Adolf Hitler as a welcome solution to both of these \"world problems\" (Nancy's phrase).  . . .  Kennedy replied that he expected the \"Jew media\" in the United States to become a problem, that \"Jewish pundits in New York and Los Angeles\" were already making noises contrived to \"set a match to the fuse of the world\". Astor commented to Kennedy that Hitler would have to do worse than \"give a rough time. . .  to the killers of christ\" for Britain and America to risk \"Armageddon to save them.  The wheel of history swings round as the Lord would have it.  Who are we to stand in the way of the future?\" Astor made various other documented anti-Semitic comments, such as her complaint that the Observer newspaper, which was owned at the time by her husband, was \"full of homosexuals and Jews\", and her tense antisemitic exchange with MP Alan Graham in 1938, as described by Harold Nicolson: In the corridor a friend of mine named Alan Graham came up to Nancy and said, 'I do not think you behaved very well' [in a meeting of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee].  She turned upon him and said, 'Only a Jew like you would dare to be rude to me. ' He replied, 'I should like very much to smack you in your face. ' I think she is a little mad. David Feldman of the Pears Institute for the Study of Anti-Semitism has also related that whilst attending a dinner at the Savoy Hotel in 1934, Astor asked the League of Nations' High Commissioner for Refugees whether he believed \"that there must be something in the Jews themselves that had brought them persecution throughout the ages\".  Dr Feldman acknowledged, however, that it was \"not an unusual view\" and explained it \"was a conventional idea in the UK at the time\". Some years later, during a visit to New York in 1947, she apparently \"clashed\" with reporters, renouncing her anti-Semitism, telling one that she was \"not anti-Jewish but gangsterism isn't going to solve the Palestine problem\". Astor was also deeply involved in the so-called Cliveden Set, a coterie of aristocrats that was described by one journalist as having subscribed to their own form of fascism. In that capacity, Astor was considered a \"legendary hostess\" for the group that in 1936 welcomed Hitler's foreign minister, Joachim von Ribbentrop, who communicated to Hitler regarding the likelihood of an agreement between Germany and England and singled out the Astorgruppe as one of the circles \"that want a fresh understanding with Germany and who hold that it would not basically be impossible to achieve\". The Sunday newspaper Reynolds News, also reported, \"Cliveden has been the centre of friendship with German influence\".  To that end, several of her friends and associates, especially the Marquess of Lothian, were involved in the policy of appeasement of Nazi Germany.  Astor, however, was worried that the group might be viewed as a pro-German conspiracy, and her husband, William Waldorf Astor, wrote in a letter to the Times, \"To link our weekends with any particular clique is as absurd as is the allegation that those of us who desire to establish better relations with Germany or Italy are pro-Nazis or pro-Fascists\". The Cliveden Set was also depicted by war agitators as the prime movers for peace.  At the request of her friend Felix Frankfurter, a future US Supreme Court justice who was Jewish, Astor intervened with the Nazis in Vienna and secured the release of Frankfurter's Jewish uncle, Solomon. Astor occasionally met with Nazi officials in keeping with Neville Chamberlain's policies, and she was known to distrust and to dislike British Foreign Secretary (later Prime Minister) Anthony Eden.  She is alleged to have told one Nazi official that she supported German rearmament because the country was \"surrounded by Catholics\".  She also told Ribbentrop, the German ambassador, who later became the foreign minister of Germany, that Hitler looked too much like Charlie Chaplin to be taken seriously.  Those statements are the only documented incidents of her direct expressions to Nazis. Astor became increasingly harsh in her anti-Catholic and anti-communist sentiments.  After the passage of the Munich Agreement, she said that if the Czech refugees fleeing Nazi oppression were communists, they should seek asylum with the Soviets, instead of the British.  While supporters of appeasement felt that to be out of line, the Marquess of Lothian encouraged her comments. When World War II began, Astor admitted that she had made mistakes, and voted against Chamberlain, but left-wing hostility to her politics remained.  In a 1939 speech, the Labour MP Stafford Cripps called her \"The Member for Berlin\". Astor's fear of Catholics increased and she made a speech saying that a Catholic conspiracy was subverting the Foreign Office.  Based on her opposition to Communists, she insulted Stalin's role (from 1941) as one of the Allied Powers during the war.  Her speeches became rambling and incomprehensible; an opponent said that debating her had become \"like playing squash with a dish of scrambled eggs\". On one occasion she accosted a young American soldier outside the Houses of Parliament.  \"Would you like to go in?\" she asked.  The GI replied: \"You are the sort of woman my mother told me to avoid\". The period from 1937 to the end of the war was personally difficult for Astor: in January of that year she lost her sister Phyllis, followed by her only surviving brother in 1938.  In 1940, the Marquess of Lothian died.  He had been her closest Christian Scientist friend even after her husband converted.  George Bernard Shaw's wife died three years later.  During the war, Astor's husband had a heart attack.  After this, their marriage grew cold, likely due to her subsequent discomfort with his health problems.  She ran a hospital for Canadian soldiers as she had during the First World War, but openly expressed a preference for the earlier soldiers. It was generally believed that it was Lady Astor who, during a World War II speech, first referred to the men of the 8th Army who were fighting in the Italian campaign as the \"D-Day Dodgers\".  Observers thought she was suggesting they were avoiding the \"real war\" in France and the future invasion.  The Allied soldiers in Italy were so incensed that Major Hamish Henderson of the 51st Highland Division composed a bitingly sarcastic song to the tune of the popular German song \"Lili Marleen\", called \"The Ballad of the D-Day Dodgers\".  This song has also been attributed to Lance-Sergeant Harry Pynn of the Tank Rescue Section, 19 Army Fire Brigade. When told she was one of the people listed to be arrested, imprisoned and face possible execution in \"The Black Book\" under a German invasion of Britain, Lady Astor commented: \"It is the complete answer to the terrible lie that the so-called 'Cliveden Set' was pro-Fascist. A statue at Cliveden , overlooking 42 inscribed stones dedicated to the dead of World War I.  Sir Bertram MacKennal's figure represents Canada with the head reputedly modelled by Lady Astor Lady Astor believed her party and her husband caused her retirement in 1945.  As the Conservatives believed she had become a political liability in the final years of World War II, her husband said that if she stood for office again the family would not support her.  She conceded but, according to contemporary reports, was both irritated and angry about her situation. Lady Astor struggled in retirement, which put further strain on her marriage. In a speech commemorating her 25 years in parliament, she stated that her retirement was forced on her and that it should please the men of Britain.  The couple began travelling separately and soon were living apart.  Lord Astor also began moving towards left-wing politics in his last years, and that exacerbated their differences.  However, the couple reconciled before his death on 30 September 1952. Lady Astor's public image suffered, as her ethnic and religious views were increasingly out of touch with cultural changes in Britain.  She expressed a growing paranoia regarding ethnic minorities.  In one instance, she stated that the President of the United States had become too dependent on New York City.  To her this city represented \"Jewish and foreign\" influences that she feared.  During a US tour, she told a group of African-American students that they should aspire to be like the black servants she remembered from her youth.  On a later trip, she told African-American church members that they should be grateful for slavery because it had allowed them to be introduced to Christianity.  In Rhodesia she proudly told the white minority government leaders that she was the daughter of a slave owner. After 1956, Nancy Astor became increasingly isolated.  In 1959, she was honoured by receiving the Freedom of City of Plymouth.  By this time, she had lost all her sisters and brothers, her colleague \"Red Ellen\" Wilkinson died in 1947, George Bernard Shaw died in 1950, and she did not take well to widowhood.  Her son Bobbie Shaw became increasingly combative and after her death he committed suicide.  Her son, Jakie, married a prominent Catholic woman, which hurt his relationship with his mother.  She and her other children became estranged.  Gradually she began to accept Catholics as friends.  However, she said that her final years were lonely. Lady Astor died in 1964 at her daughter Nancy Astor's home at Grimsthorpe Castle in Lincolnshire.  She was cremated and her ashes interred at the Octagon Temple at Cliveden. She was known for exchanges with Winston Churchill, though most of these are not well documented.  Churchill told Lady Astor that having a woman in Parliament was like having one intrude on him in the bathroom, to which she retorted, \"You're not handsome enough to have such fears. \" Lady Astor is also said to have responded to a question from Churchill about what disguise he should wear to a masquerade ball by saying, \"Why don't you come sober, Prime Minister?\" Although variations on the following anecdote exist with different people, the story is being told of Winston Churchill's encounter with Lady Astor who, after failing to shake him in an argument, broke off with the petulant remark, \"Oh, if you were my husband, I'd put poison in your tea. \" \"Madame,\" Winston responded, \"if I were your husband, I'd drink it with pleasure. \" On another occasion, Lady Astor allegedly came upon Churchill, and he was highly intoxicated.  She highly disapproved of alcohol, and she said to him \"Winston, you're drunk!\" To which he replied \"And you are ugly.  However, when I wake up tomorrow, I shall be sober, and you will still be ugly!\" Legacy  In 1982 the BBC broadcast a nine-part television drama serial about her life, Nancy Astor, which starred Lisa Harrow.  A bronze statue of Lady Astor was installed in Plymouth, near her former family home, in 2019 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of her election to Parliament. Astor's antisemitism has been widely documented and has been criticised in recent years, particularly in light of former Prime Minister Theresa May's 2019 unveiling of a statue in her honour with current Prime Minister Boris Johnson in attendance, and more recently after Labour MP Rachel Reeves commemorated Astor in a series of tweets. The then-leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, while opposed to her anti-semitism, recognised she was the first woman MP to take up her place in Parliament and so praised installation of the statue, commenting \"I'm really pleased the statue is going up\". During the George Floyd protests in 2020, the word \"Nazi\" was spray-painted on its base.  The statue was on a list published on a website called Topple the Racists.

She was elected to Parliament for Plymouth Sutton in November 1919, replacing her husband who had previously been the MP.  Astor was elected following a by-election on 15 November 1919, although she had to wait until 28 November for the results to be announced, where it turned out she received more votes than the Labour and Liberal candidates combined.  She entered the House of Commons on 1 December 1919 to take her oath, sponsored by Prime Minister David Lloyd George and Lord President of the Council and former Prime Minister Arthur Balfour.  Who was Nancy Astor? Nancy Witcher Langhorne was born in Danville, Virginia in 1879, the eighth of eleven children born to railroad businessman Chiswell Dabney Langhorne and his wife Nancy Witcher Keene.  The first years of her life were impoverished, as her father struggled to make his operations profitable following the abolition of slavery and the destruction of the American Civil War.  Yet, by the time she reached her teenage years Nancy's father had become a wealthy businessman, making a fortune in construction, rail and tobacco and the family moved to an estate, Mirador, in Albemarle County, Virginia.  In the 1890s Nancy and her sister Irene were enrolled in a finishing school in New York City where they were taught etiquette in preparation for entering high society.  It was there that Nancy met her first husband, socialite Robert Gould Shaw II.  The pair married on 27 October 1897 in New York when Nancy was 18 and in August 1898 they welcomed the birth of their son, Robert Gould Shaw III (called Bobby).  However, the marriage was unhappy and the couple divorced in 1903.  Around the same time Nancys mother died, so Nancy moved back to Mirador to try and help run her fathers household, but this proved unsuccessful.  After falling in love with England following a tour she took there, Nancys father suggested she move there permanently as it made her so happy and in 1905 Nancy, her son and younger sister Phyllis moved to England.  Witty, beautiful, glamorous, clever, fashionable, generous - Nancy became known amongst the aristocracy upon arrival in England and moved in high social circles.  She soon caught the eye of Waldorf Astor - the son of Viscount Astor, owner of The Independent newspaper - and within six months the couple were married.  The couple were well-matched; both were American expatriates with similar temperaments and in a strange coincidence were of the same age, born on the same day 19 May 1879.  After the marriage the Astors moved into Cliveden, a lavish Buckinghamshire estate (a wedding gift from Waldorfs father), and Nancy became a prominent hostess amongst the English elite.  The couple had five children - four boys: William Waldorf Astor II, Francis David Langhorne Astor, Michael Langhorne Astor and John Jacob Astor VII - and one girl: Nancy Phyllis Louise Astor.  Nancys childhood home, the Langhorne House in Danville, Virginia Mirador, the Langhorne estate in Albermarle County, VIrginia Portrait of Nancy Astor by John Singer Sargent, 1909 A political couple Through his wife, Waldorf Astor developed an interest in social reform.  Encouraged by Nancy to launch a career in politics, Waldorf was defeated in an initial attempt to win election to the House of Commons in the January 1910 general election.  However, he won election as a Unionist for the borough of Plymouth in the December 1910 general election.  Nancy too had political interests; through her many social connections she had become involved in a political circle called 'Milners Kindergarten, a group considered liberal at the time, which advocated unity and equality among English-speaking people and a continuance or expansion of British imperialism.  Waldorf enjoyed a promising political career for some years and in 1918, when his constituency was dissolved, became MP for Plymouth Sutton, a position he held until 1919.  After his fathers death in October 1919, Waldorf succeeded to his fathers peerage, inheriting the title 2nd Viscount Astor (making Nancy 'Viscountess Astor) and automatically becoming a member of the House of Lords.  Consequently he had to relinquish his seat of Plymouth Sutton in the House of Commons, triggering a by-election.  With Waldorf having to move 'upstairs to the House of Lords, his wife decided to contest the vacant Parliamentary seat as the previous year had seen the 1918 Parliament (Qualification of Women) Act passed, which allowed women to become MPs.  Nancy stood as a Unionist candidate (now the Conservative Party), although many had reservations, including the Unionist Party Chairman Sir George Younger, who said: '. . . the worst of it is, the woman is sure to get in.  Nancy was at her best during electioneering.  Her natural wit and charm endeared her to voters of all classes, although she was hampered in the popular campaign for her known opposition to alcohol consumption and ignorance of current political issues.  Her informal style baffled yet amused the British public and by rallying the supporters of the current government, moderating her prohibition views and using womens meetings to gain the support of female voters, Nancy won the election, beating her main rival Liberal Isaac Foot (father of Michael Foot, who went on to lead the Labour party).  Interestingly, after World War I Plymouth Sutton had a majority of women voters.  The result was announced on 28 November 1919 and she took up her seat in the House on 1 December as a Unionist Member of Parliament.  Not the first woman elected Although Nancy was the first woman to take her seat in the House of Commons, she was not the first elected.  That was achieved in 1918 by Constance Markievicz, an Irish Republican who was detained in Holloway Prison at the time and, as a member of Sinn Fein, disqualified herself by refusing to take the oath.  Constance Markievicz In parliament A master of repartee, Nancy Astor needed to have all her wits about her to survive in the male dominated arena of politics.  She gained attention as someone who did not follow the rules - for example, when David Lloyd George was called to swear her in he set off before the others and was pulled back and scolded by Nancy.  On another occasion, her first day in the House of Commons, she was called to order for chatting with a fellow House member, not realising she was who was causing the commotion.  Nancy quickly became known for her outspoken views of specific issues, including advocating womens rights and stricter restrictions on alcohol.  Yet, despite claiming to be an ardent feminist, suffrage campaigners were initially dismayed that the first female MP had never had ties to their movement.  On 24 February 1920, Nancy stood alone amongst an audience of over 500, mostly hostile, male MPs to deliver her maiden speech.  In her speech she referred to the fact that some women over the age of 30 could now vote in Britain: 'You must remember that women have got a vote now and we mean to use it, and use it wisely and also spoke about the perils of drinking, emphasising the damage it caused to women and children, as well as the economic cost to the country, and appealing for stricter restrictions on the drinking hours that had come into effect during the First World War.  During the initial years of her political career Nancy supported lowering the voting age of women to 21 (an Act that was later passed in 1928) and proposed raising the age of alcohol to 18 (it was set at 14 in 1901), an Act that was passed in a 1923 Private Members Bill and which remains to this day.  Nancy spent almost two years as the only woman in the House of Commons against a backdrop of sexism and, often, outright resentment.  Active both inside and outside of government she supported welfare reforms and equal voting rights and was also supportive of other female MPs, regardless of political party.  During this period Nancy also advocated the development and expansion of nursery schools for childrens education and she worked to recruit women into the civil service, the police force, education reform and the House of Lords.  She was also concerned about the treatment of juvenile victims of crime.  In the 1930s both Nancy and her husband Waldorf objected to engaging in the Second World War.  They and several friends and associates backed Neville Chamberlains appeasement policy in reducing the threat of entering into a war with Germany and became known as the 'Cliveden set, although there is some dispute over the set's allegiances to fascism and Nazi Germany.  Nevertheless, Nancy became critical of Chamberlains leadership in the early stages of the war and voted against the Government in May 1940, helping Winston Churchill to become Prime Minister.  It was around this time that Nancy started to lose popularity among her fellow MPs, as she became increasingly erratic and made a number of long-winded speeches, including one in which she said that a Catholic conspiracy was subverting the foreign office and another disastrous one in which she stated that alcohol was the reason Englands national cricket team was defeated by the Australians.  Cliveden, Waldorf and Nancy Astors country house that served as a hospital in the World Wars Despite her opposition to the war, Nancy contributed to the war effort by running a hospital for Canadian soldiers.  The Astors were also hugely generous with their wealth, giving buildings, land and money to the city of Plymouth, including 3 Elliot Terrace, which became the official residence of the Lord Mayor of Plymouth (now accommodation for official visitors).  Nancy won seven elections between 1919 and 1935 and was MP for Plymouth Sutton for 26 years until the 1945 election when she decided not to stand on the advice of both the Conservative Party (who felt she had become a political liability) and her husband who refused to support her running for office again.  In the same year that she retired, 24 women became MPs and took their seats in parliament.  Nancys retirement put increasing strain upon her marriage to Waldorf and before long the couple were living apart.  They were separated for a number of years, before reconciling shortly before Waldorfs death in September 1952.  Honorary Plymothian Waldorf Astor was appointed Lord Mayor of Plymouth in 1939, despite not being a member of the city council - an honour which had been given only once before to Sir Francis Drake.  Representing Plymouth as an MP and as Lady Mayoress during the Second World War, Nancy Astors life and work were closely identified with the city and in 1959 she was made an honorary Freeman of the City of Plymouth.  The same year Viscountess Astor performed the launching ceremony for HMS Plymouth, the first ship for 250 years to bear the name, and presented a diamond and sapphire necklace to be worn by Lady Mayoress of Plymouth.  She was made CH (Order of the Companions of Honour) in 1937. ", "article_3": "When Lady Astor took her seat in Parliament, the novelty of a woman member nonplussed many of her colleagues.  Reproached by Lady Astor for ignoring her during the first few months of her first term, Winston Churchill replied frankly that he had hoped to freeze her out, and added that \"When you took your seat I felt as if a woman had come into my bathroom and I had only a sponge with which to defend myself. \" Some of the reported exchanges between Lady Astor and the future Prime Minister may have been apocryphal.  In one such exchange, Lady Astor is said to have told him: \"If I were your wife I'd give you poison in your coffee. \" He replied: \"If you were my wife . I'd drink it. \" Lady Astor seemed to have thought of at least one other person in terms of poisoning.  At a Washington cocktail party in 1953, she saw the late Senator Joseph R.  McCarthy of Wisconsin take a drink.  \"Too bad it isn't poison,\" Lady Astor remarked.  A newspaper editor who had heard her remark demanded her arrest.  He said she was inciting to crime.  Lady Astor said that she would be glad to accept a warrant for her arrest on this charge.  Later she denied that she had hoped for Senator McCarthy's death by poison.  Senator McCarthy was much in the news at the time in connection with his investigations of persons in the United States Government service whom he considered Communists or Communist sympathizers.  Nancy Witcher Langhorne was one of the 11 children6 daughters and 5 sons -- of Chiswell Dabney Langhorne, member of a wealthy and socially prominent Virginia family.  One of the girls, Mary, died in infancy.  Lady Astor was the last survivor among the five other daughters, who were known in their youth as the beautiful Langhorne sisters.  One of them, Irene; was married to Charles Dana Gibson, the painter and illustrator who created the Gibson girl.  Nancy was born at Danville, Va. , on the North Carolina border.  She spent much of her childhood at Mirador, the Langhorne estate at Greenwood, Va.  The date of her birth was May 19, 18 7 9.

S. --died May 2, 1964, Grimsthorpe Castle, Lincolnshire, England), first woman to sit in the British House of Commons, known in public and private life for her great energy and wit.  In 1897 she married Robert Gould Shaw of Boston, from whom she was divorced in 1903, and in 1906 she married Waldorf Astor, great-great-grandson of John Jacob Astor.  When her husband succeeded to his fathers viscountcy and thus relinquished his seat in the House of Commons, Lady Astor, who had been his constant comrade-in-arms in his constituency at Plymouth, was adopted as Unionist candidate in his place and, after a stirring campaign, was elected by a substantial majority on November 28, 1919.  Lady Astor was returned for Plymouth at subsequent general elections until her retirement from Parliament in 1945.  Apart from questions relating exclusively to women, her chief parliamentary work was done for a progressive educational policy, for temperance, and for the extension of the Trade Boards Acts.  She constantly advocated the raising of the school-leaving age and in 1923 carried through the Intoxicating Liquor (Sale to Persons under 18) Bill.  She also maintained a continuous agitation for improved conditions in certain branches of the distributive and catering trades.  No less potent was her role as hostess at Cliveden, the Astors country house near Taplow, Buckinghamshire, where she maintained a salon that exercised considerable influence in many fields, notably foreign affairs.  Members of the group were called the \"Cliveden set. \"", "article_6": "Nancy Witcher Astor, Viscountess Astor, Companion of Honour (CH), (May 19, 1879 - May 2, 1964) was the first woman to serve as a Member of Parliament (MP) in the British House of Commons.  She was the wife of Waldorf Astor, 2nd Viscount Astor.  Born in the United States, her first marriage to Robert Gould Shaw ended in divorce.  She moved to England in 1905.  In she married the future Viscount Astor in 1906, who was himself elected to Parliament in 1910.  When he succeeded to the title in 1919 and entered the House of Lords, Lady Astor stood for and won his vacant seat in the lower house.  She retained her seat until her retirement in 1945.  During her tenure, she did much to encourage women to enter the civil service, the police and to promote education reform.  Her support for German re-armament because she saw the Third Reich as a potential ally in the battle against communism and because she shared Adolf Hitler's hatred of Jews and dislike of Catholics, however, meant that as World War II her views were out of sympathy with those of the British public.  Her opposition to the war even earned her the title of \"Hitler's woman in Britain\" and \"the Honourable Member from Berlin. \" On the one hand, she did not hold any political office, nor was she responsible for any major legislative achievement.  On the other hand, she represented a formidable presence in the House, renowned for her wit and demonstrated that women in parliament could conduct themselves as competently as men.  From a moral point of view, some of her beliefs were discriminatory and divisive.  However, she did much to convince a nation, still skeptical about women's ability to contribute outside the home, that women could bring a different perspective, supplementing men's, into public discourse.  Early Life Nancy Astor was born Nancy Witcher Langhorne on May 19, 1879, in Danville, Virginia, in the United States.  Her mother was Nancy Witcher Keene, and her father was Chiswell Dabney Langhorne.  The former business of her father had depended at least in part upon slave labor and had been badly damaged by the effects of the American Civil War.  Because of this the Langhornes lived in near-poverty conditions for a period before she was born.  That stated after her birth her father began regaining the family wealth.  This started with work as an auctioneer and later through his involvement with the railroad.  When she reached 13 years of age the Langhornes were again a rich family with a sizeable estate. Chiswell Langhorne later moved to Albemarle County.  Nancy Langhorne had four sisters and three brothers.  All of the sisters were known for their beauty; her sister Irene later married the artist Charles Dana Gibson and became a model for the Gibson girl.  Nancy and Irene both went to a finishing school in New York City.  In New York, Nancy met and married her first husband, Robert Gould Shaw, a relative of Robert Gould Shaw of Fort Wagner fame (a American Civil War battle), on October 27, 1897, when she was 18.  This first marriage was a disaster.  Shaw's friends accused Nancy of becoming puritanical and rigid after she married; Nancy's friends contended that Shaw was an alcoholic adulterer.  The couple was married for four years and had one son, Bobbie.  Nancy left Shaw numerous times during their brief marriage, the first time during their honeymoon.  In 1903, Nancy's mother died and Nancy moved back to Mirador, her father's home in Albemarle County, Virginia. She tried to run the household for him but was unsuccessful.  She left there and took a tour of England, and fell in love with the country while she was there.  Because she was so happy there, her father suggested that Nancy move to England.  Nancy was reluctant to go, so he suggested that the move had been her mothers wish and that it would also be good for Nancy's younger sister, Phyllis, to accompany her.  Nancy and Phyllis finally moved to England in 1905.  England The earlier trip to England had launched Nancy's reputation there as an interesting and witty American.  Her tendency to be witty and saucy in conversation--yet religiously devout and almost prudish in behavior--confused many of the English men, but pleased some of the older socialites.  They liked conversing with the lively and exciting American who at the same time largely conformed to decency and restraint.  Nancy also began at this time to show her skill at winning over critics.  She was once asked by an English woman, Mrs.  Cunard, wife of the Cunard shipping magnate, \"Have you come to get our husbands?\" Her unexpected response, \"If you knew the trouble I had getting rid of mine. . . \" charmed her listeners and displayed the wit that would later become so famous.  As a result of this reply, Mrs.  Cunard and Nancy became life-long friends. A contemporary view of Cliveden, Nancy Astor's country house that served as a hospital in the World Wars Despite her protestations, however, she indeed married an Englishman.  Her second husband, Waldorf Astor, was born in the United States but his father had moved the family to England when Waldorf was 12 and raised his children as English aristocrats.  The pair was well matched from the start.  Not only were they both American expatriates with similar temperaments, but they were even born on the exact same day.  He shared some of her moral attitudes, and his heart condition may have encouraged him toward a restraint that she found comforting.  The marriage's success, therefore, seemed assured.  After the Astors married, Nancy moved into Cliveden, a lavish estate in Buckinghamshire on the River Thames, and began her life as a prominent hostess for the social elite.  The Astors also owned a grand London house, No.  4 St.  James's Square, which is now the premises of the Naval & Military Club.  Through her many social connections, Lady Astor became involved in a kind of political circle called Milner's Kindergarten.  Considered liberal in their age, the group advocated unity and equality among English-speaking people and a continuance or expansion of British imperialism.  Christian Science The groups political significance was limited, but it yielded a much more significant result for Lady Astor personally.  It was the source of her friendship with Philip Kerr, which was to be one of the most important relationships of her life.  Indeed, it came at a critical juncture for both of them.  The two met shortly after Kerr had suffered a spiritual crisis regarding his once devout Catholicism.  The two of them were both searching for spiritual stability and their search led them toward Christian Science, to which they both eventually converted.  Astor's beliefs and activities as a Christian Scientist would become one of the most consistent elements of her life.  A statue at Cliveden, overlooking 42 inscribed stones dedicated to the dead of World War I.  Sir Bertram MacKennal's figure represents Canada with the head reputedly modeled by Lady Astor.  Astor's conversion was gradual and was influenced by a number of factors.  Her sister Phyllis had given her Science and Health by Mary Baker Eddy because she thought Nancy might find it interesting.  (Phyllis, however, never became a Christian Scientist. ) At first Lady Astor had only marginal interest, but after a period of illness and surgery, she decided that those events had not been what God wanted.  In the past she had been the type of person whose illnesses had largely been psychosomatic, so this rang true for her and she embraced the belief system wholeheartedly.  Her former spiritual mentor and good friend, Archdeacon Frederick Neve, disapproved of her conversion and their relationship soured.  Lady Astor's devotion to Christian Science was more intense than orthodox, and she sent some practitioners away for disagreeing with her.  But she was deeply committed to her own interpretation of the faith and held to it almost fanatically.  Many of her letters from that time on mentioned Christian Science, and letters from others to her joked about her efforts to convert peers to her beliefs.  Philip Kerr's conversion came only after experimenting with Eastern religion, but he later became a spiritual advisor for Astor.  In time, his bitter rejection of Catholicism also influenced Lady Astor, intensifying her opinions in that direction.  She was also affected when her friendship with Hillaire Belloc, who was Catholic, began to grow cold because of his disdain for the rich and her efforts to convert his daughters to Christian Science.  The loss of that relationship further alienated her against Roman Catholicism.  During World War I Cliveden was turned into a hospital for Canadian soldiers.  Although Astor, as a Christian Scientist, did not believe in the use of medical practices, she got along well with doctors, especially a surgeon named Colonel Mewburn.  She justified her position there by helping those who needed non-medical assistance.  This work built a public image of Lady Astor as a friend to soldiers, and that proved useful when she ran for office.  At the same time, horrible poison gas attacks and the deaths of friends turned her against war itself.  First campaign for Parliament Several elements of Lady Astor's life to this point influenced her first campaign, but the main reason she became a candidate in the first place was her husband's situation.  He had enjoyed a promising career for several years before World War I in the House of Commons serving as parliamentary secretary to the Prime Minister, but then he succeeded to his father's peerage as the 2nd Viscount Astor.  This meant that he automatically became a member of the House of Lords and forfeited his seat of Plymouth Sutton in the House of Commons.  So Lady Astor decided to contest the vacant parliamentary seat.  Astor had several disadvantages in her campaign.  One of them was her lack of connection with the women's suffrage movement.  The first woman elected to the British Parliament, Constance Markiewicz, said Lady Astor was \"of the upper classes, out of touch. \" While Lady Astor was the first female member of the House of Commons who actually took up her seat, she was not the first woman to be elected to the House.  Markiewicz did not take up her seat because of her Irish nationalist views.  Later, however, as a member of the Irish legislature, she became the first women in Europe to become a cabinet minister.  Countess Markiewicz had been in Holloway prison for Sinn Fein activities during her election, and other suffragettes had been imprisoned for arson; Astor had no such background.  Despite her comments about Lady Astor being of the \"upper classes,\" Markiewicz was herself the daughter of a baronet.  Even more damaging to Astor's campaign were her well-known hostility to alcohol consumption and her ignorance of current political issues.  These points did not endear her to the people of Plymouth, the constituency from which she was elected.  Perhaps worst of all, her tendency to say odd or outlandish things sometimes made her look rather unstable.  However, Astor also had some positive attributes in her campaign, such as her earlier work with the Canadian soldiers, her other charitable work during the war, her vast financial resources for the campaign and, most of all, her ability to improvise.  Her ability to turn the tables on the hecklers was particularly useful.  Once a man asked her what the Astors had done for him and she responded with, \"Why, Charlie, you know,\" and later had a picture taken with him. This informal style baffled yet amused the British public.  She rallied the supporters of the current government, was pragmatic enough to moderate her Prohibitionist views, and used womens meetings to gain the support of female voters.  A by-election was held on 28 November, 1919, and she took up her seat in the House on December 1 as a Unionist (also known as \"Tory\") Member of Parliament.  Early Years in Parliament Astor's parliamentary career was the most public phase of her life, during which she was an object of both love and hatred.  Her presence almost immediately gained attention, both as a woman and as someone who did not follow the rules.  On her first day in the House of Commons, she was called to order for chatting with a fellow House member, not realizing that she was the person who was causing the commotion.  She did try in some ways to minimize disruption by dressing more sedately than usual and by avoiding the bars and smoking rooms frequented by the men.  On her first day in the chamber, however, in which no other woman had taken a seat throughout its long history, no one was especially helpful when it came to her finding a place to actually sit down.  She sat in a vacant seat which turned out to be where a certain Sir William Johnson-Hicks habitually sat (there are actually no designated seats).  He was visiting Egypt at the time.  On his return, he made \"a constitutional affair\" over his right to occupy the seat, and Lady Astor had to move to a place on the opposition benches, where she remained for some time.  Her ability to forge positive relations across the party divide is noted by a 1921 biography, who comments that she \"has good friends\" among the Labour members, on whose benches she sat. The author gave a somewhat unflattering description of her at the time: She speaks rarely.  Her voice is, in the upper notes, a little harsh (a common fault among fashionable women in England), has one or two good deep notes but no intermediate tones.  There are faint traces of an American accent. . . .  She is clearly not an intellectual woman, and her influence in parliament, which is rather greater than is generally thought, is due to purely feminine qualities.  Conspicuous among these are motherly wit, simplicity, naturalness . . . .  Contrary to Countess Markiewicz's remarks about her as \"out of touch,\" though, Sidebotham also commented that \"in spite of her millions, it is noticeable that the average working man gets her women's point of view much more quickly than the average middle class man. \" Early in her first term, a fellow Member of Parliament named Horatio Bottomley, who felt Astor was an obstacle in his desire to dominate the \"soldiers friend\" issue, sought to ruin her political career.  He did this by capitalizing on the first substantial controversies in which she participated, namely her opposition to divorce reform and her efforts to maintain wartime alcohol restrictions.  He depicted her as a hypocrite in his newspaper, saying that the divorce reform bill she opposed allowed women to have the kind of divorce she had had in America.  However, a budget crisis and his bitter tone caused this effort to backfire.  Bottomley eventually went to prison for fraud, a fact that Astor used to her advantage in later campaigns.  Among her early political friends were the first female candidates to follow her to Parliament, including members of the other parties.  The first of them began when Ellen Wintringham was elected after Astor had been in office for two years, but the most surprising might have been her friendship with \"Red Ellen\" Wilkinson, a former Communist representative in the Labour Party.  Astor later proposed creating a \"Womens Party,\" but the female Labour MPs thought it was a ridiculous idea because at that time their party had power and promised them positions.  Astor conceded this, but her closeness with other female MPs dissipated with time and by 1931 she even became hostile to female Labour members like Susan Lawrence.  Unlike most of the other women, Lady Astor's accomplishments in the House of Commons were relatively minor.  She never held a position of much influence.  Indeed, the Duchess of Atholl (elected in 1923) rose to higher levels in the Tory Party before Astor did, and this was largely as Astor wished.  She felt that if she had a position in the party, she would be less free to criticize her partys government.  One of her few significant achievements in the House was the passage of a bill she sponsored to increase the legal drinking age to 18 unless the minor has parental approval.  However, there are few opportunities in the British parliamentary system for private members to sponsor legislation, so lack of achievement in this area is by no means untypical for someone who sits on the back-benches.  Lady Astor did do some significant work outside the political sphere.  The most famous was her support for nursery schools.  Her involvement with this cause was somewhat surprising in a way because the woman who first focused her attention on it was a Socialist named Margaret McMillan who believed that her dead sister still had a role in guiding her.  Lady Astor was initially skeptical, but later the two women became close and Astor used her wealth to aid their efforts.  Astor's positive traits and good works do not negate the fact her political career displayed some cruelty and callousness.  On hearing of the death of a political enemy, she openly expressed her pleasure.  When people complained about this, she did not apologize but instead said, \"Im a Virginian; we shoot to kill. \" A friend from Virginia, Angus McDonnell, had angered her when he married without consulting her after having agreed to seek her permission first.  She later told him, regarding his maiden speech, that he \"really must do better than that. \" In addition to these, she also alienated several others with her sharp tongue throughout her life.  The 1920s were Astor's most positive period in Parliament, when she made several effective speeches and introduced a bill that passed.  Although she was not always the ideal Member of Parliament, her wealth and striking persona brought some attention to women in the House.  She worked to bring more women into the civil service and the police force and to reform education and the House of Lords.  In addition, she remained popular in her district and well liked in the U. S.  during the 1920s, but this period of success would not continue forever.  The Depression Years Unlike the previous decade, the 1930s would be one of personal and professional difficulty for Lady Astor.  An early sign of future problems came in 1928 when she only barely defeated the Labour candidate.  In 1931 her problems became more acute when her son from her first marriage, Bobbie, was arrested for homosexuality.  Because Bobbie had previously shown tendencies toward alcoholism and instability, Astor's friend Philip Kerr, now Marquess of Lothian, told her that the arrest might be positive for him.  This would turn out to be incorrect.  Astor also made a disastrous speech stating that the England cricket team lost to the national Australian cricket team because of alcohol use.  Both the English and Australian teams objected to this.  Astor remained oblivious to her growing unpopularity almost to the end.  A mixed element in these difficult years was Astor's friendship with George Bernard Shaw.  He helped her through some of her problems, but also made some things worse.  Their friendship was somewhat peculiar because they held opposing political views and had very different temperaments, but he liked her as a fellow non-conformist, and she had a fondness for writers in general.  Nevertheless, his tendency to make controversial statements or put her into awkward situations proved to be a drawback for her.  Trip to Soviet Union After Astor's son Bobbie was arrested, Shaw invited her to accompany him on his trip to the Soviet Union.  Although it was helpful in some ways, this trip turned out to be bad overall for Lady Astor's political career.  During the trip Shaw made many flattering statements about Stalinist Russia, while Nancy often disparaged it because she was generally not in favor of Communism.  She even asked Stalin point-blank why he had slaughtered so many Russians, but many of her criticisms were translated into innocuous statements instead.  This led many of her conservative supporters to fear she had \"gone soft\" on Communism.  Even her question to Stalin may have been likewise translated if he had not insisted that he be told what she had actually said. Furthermore, Shaw's praise of the USSR made the trip seem like a coup for Soviet propaganda and made her presence there disturbing for the Tories.  As bad as the Soviet trip was, it was minor compared to what would follow.  Although Astor had criticized the Nazis for devaluing the position of women, she was also adamantly opposed to another World War.  Several of her friends and associates, especially Lord Lothian (Philip Kerr), became heavily involved in the German appeasement policy; this group became known as the \"Cliveden set. \" The term was first used in the newspaper, The Week, run by reformist Claud Cockburn; excitement over it grew and the allegations became more elaborate.  The Cliveden set was seen variously as the prime mover for appeasement, or a society that secretly ran the nation, or even as a beachhead for Nazism in Britain.  Astor was viewed by some as Adolf Hitlers woman in Britain, and some went so far as to claim that she had hypnotic powers.  Nazi sympathies Astor had a close friendship with American ambassador to Britain Joseph P.  Kennedy, Sr. ; the correspondence between them is reportedly replete with anti-Semitic tropes.  As Edward Renehan notes: As fiercely anti-Communist as they were anti-Semitic, Kennedy and Astor looked upon Adolf Hitler as a welcome solution to both of these \"world problems\" (Nancy's phrase). . . .  Kennedy replied that he expected the \"Jew media\" in the United States to become a problem, that \"Jewish pundits in New York and Los Angeles\" were already making noises contrived to \"set a match to the fuse of the world. \" Evidence supporting these allegations is weak, but Astor did occasionally meet with Nazi officials in keeping with Neville Chamberlain's ideals.  She told one such Nazi official, who later turned out to be trying to ruin the Nazis from within, that she supported their re-armament.  However, she did so because Germany was \"surrounded by Catholics\" in her opinion.  She also told Joachim von Ribbentrop, the German ambassador who would later become the Foreign Minister of Germany, that Hitler looked too much like Charlie Chaplin to be taken seriously.  These statements are the only documented incidents of Nazi sympathy of any kind, although it is true that she distrusted and disliked British Foreign Secretary (and later Prime Minister) Anthony Eden, stating that the more she saw of him the \"more certain\" she was that he would \"never be a Disraeli. \" Lady Astor seemed largely unconcerned by the fact that so many of her public statements caused difficulties.  She became even harsher in her anti-Catholicism and anti-Communism.  After passage of the Munich Agreement, she said that if the Czech refugees fleeing Nazi oppression were Communists, they should seek asylum with the Soviets instead of the British.  Even supporters of appeasement felt this insult to be out of line, but Lord Lothian encouraged her attitudes.  He railed against the pope for not supporting Hitler's annexation of Austria and in many ways continued to influence Lady Astor.  World War II When war did come, Astor admitted that she had made mistakes, and even voted against Chamberlain, but hostility remained.  She was taken far less seriously than before, with some calling her \"The Honourable Member for Berlin. \" In addition, her abilities as an MP had declined with age.  Her increasing fear of Catholics led her to make a speech regarding her belief that a Catholic conspiracy was subverting the foreign office.  Her long-time hatred of Communists continued and she insulted Stalin's role as an ally during the war.  Her speeches became rambling and incomprehensible, and even her enemies lamented that debating her had become \"like playing squash with a dish of scrambled eggs\". She had become more of a joke than an adversary to her enemies.  The period from 1937 to the end of the war was traumatic on a personal level.  In the period of 1937-1938 both Astor's sister Phyllis and her only surviving brother died.  In 1940 her close friend and spiritual adviser Lord Lothian died as well.  Although his influence had a definite negative aspect, he had been her closest Christian Scientist friend even after her husband converted.  George Bernard Shaws wife also died about two years later.  During the war, Astor got into a fight with her husband about chocolate and soon after he had a heart attack.  After this, their marriage grew cold, probably due at least in part to the harsh effects of such a petty argument and her subsequent discomfort with his health problems.  She ran a hospital for Canadian soldiers as she had before, but openly expressed a preference for the veterans of the previous World War.  It is generally believed that it was Lady Astor who, during a World War II speech, first referred to the men of the 8th Army who were fighting in the Italian campaign as the \"D-Day Dodgers. \" Her implication was that they had it easy because they were avoiding the \"real war\" in France and the future invasion.  The Allied soldiers in Italy were so incensed that they composed a bitingly sarcastic song to the tune of the haunting German song Lili Marleen (popularized in English by Marlene Dietrich) that they called \"The Ballad Of The D-Day Dodgers,\" written by Major Hamish Henderson of the 51st Highland Division.  She also made a disparaging remark about troops involved in the Burma Campaign, warning the public to \"Beware the men with crows' feet. \" This was an allusion to the white lines often found around the eyes of white soldiers in hot climates due to squinting in the bright sunlight as it tanned their faces.  Soldiers of the 14th Army were slightly bemused to be accorded such attention and it was strongly rumored among them that her prejudice was the result of a 14th Army officer on leave either impregnating Astor's daughter or infecting her with a sexually transmitted disease.  Final Years Lady Astor did not feel that her final years were a period of personal decline.  Instead, in her opinion, it was her Party and her husband who caused her retirement in 1945.  The Tories felt that she had become a liability in the final years of World War II, and her husband told her that if she ran for office again the family would not support her.  She conceded, but with irritation and anger, according to contemporary reports. Lady Astor's retirement years proved difficult, especially for her marriage.  She publicly blamed her husband for forcing her to retire; for example, in a speech commemorating her 25 years in office she stated that her retirement was forced on her and that it should please the men of Britain.  The couple began traveling separately and living apart soon after.  Lord Astor also began moving to the left, politically, in his last years, and that exacerbated their differences.  However, the couple reconciled before his death on September 30, 1952.  This period also proved to be hard on Lady Astor's public image.  Her racial views were increasingly out of touch with cultural changes, and she expressed a growing paranoia regarding ethnic minorities.  In one instance she stated that the President of the United States had become too dependent on New York City.  To her this city represented \"Jewish and foreign\" influences that she feared.  During her U. S.  tour she also told a group of African American students that they should aspire to be like the Black servants she remembered from her youth.  On a later trip she told African American church members that they should be grateful for slavery because it had allowed them to be introduced to Christianity.  In Rhodesia she proudly told the White minority government leaders that she was the daughter of a slave owner.  After 1956 Lady Astor became increasingly isolated.  Her sisters had all died, \"Red Ellen\" Wilkinson committed suicide in 1947, George Bernard Shaw died in 1950, and she did not take well to widowhood.  Her son Bobbie became increasingly combative and after her death he committed suicide.  Her son Jakie married a prominent Catholic woman, which hurt his relationship with his mother, and her other children became estranged from her.  Ironically, these events mellowed her and she began to accept Catholics as friends.  However, she stated that her final years were lonely.  Lady Astor died in 1964 at her daughter's home at Grimsthorpe in Lincolnshire.  She was buried in Buckinghamshire, England.  Her it is the women's interest in the welfare of the individual that animates her . . .  Quotes Lady Astor is nearly as famous for her scathing wit as she is for her political career.  Many of her best known quotes are indicative of her personal and political views, such as feminism, temperance, and conservatism; others are merely humorous.  Some examples: I married beneath me - all women do.  One reason I don't drink is that I want to know when I am having a good time.  The main dangers in this life are the people who want to change everything - or nothing.  - or nothing.  The only thing I like about rich people is their money.  The penalty for success is to be bored by the people who used to snub you.  I used to dread getting older because I thought I would not be able to do all the things I wanted to do, but now that I am older I find that I don't want to do them.  Real education should educate us out of self into something far finer; into a selflessness which links us with all humanity.  The first time Adam had a chance, he laid the blame on woman.  My vigor, vitality, and cheek repel me.  I am the kind of woman I would run from. But by far the most famous were her frequent sharp exchanges with Winston Churchill.  He once told her that having a woman in Parliament was like having one intrude on him in the bathroom, to which she retorted, \"Youre not handsome enough to have such fears. \" Another time when Lady Astor was giving a costume ball, Churchill asked her what disguise she would recommend for him.  She replied, \"Why don't you come sober, Prime Minister?\" The most famous of all such anecdotes occurred when Lady Astor said to Churchill, \"If you were my husband, I'd poison your tea. \" To which he responded, \"Madam, if you were my wife, I'd drink it!\" Legacy In his not especially flattering sketch of Lady Astor's career, Sidebotham commented that while her place in history was secure as the first women member of the House of Commons, her place in that house was still uncertain.  He described her \"Parliamentary achievement\" as of 1921 as \"not great. \" He may have made the same comment after she retired, since she did not occupy a government post.  However, he also commented that she did render a significant service, which was not to discuss \"men's politics\" as men did but to \"introduce new subjects that men have overlooked, and new points of view not even suspected. \" A member of parliament's task, whether a man or a woman, is to represent their constituency, which includes men and women.  They are not tasked to represent only men or only women.  On the other hand, all members bring to their Parliamentary work a set of interests, expertise and skills which enables them to contribute to particular areas of concern; all legislators are also mandated to address national and international concerns as well as those that impact more immediately on their own constituencies.  The presence of more women in parliament, ideally, ought to introduce different insights and bring a different set of qualities than those normally associated with men, into play.  Regardless of her lack of legislative achievement and the fact that she did not occupy a ministry, Lady Astor made a valuable political contribution by showing that the presence of women in parliament drew attention to \"new subjects\" and \"new points of view\" not even \"suspected\" by men, supplementing and enriching the male perspective.  Some of Lady Astor's views, from a moral perspective, were discriminatory and divisive, so it may have been fortuitous that she possessed influence rather than exercised power.

Labouchere was born in Over Stowey, Somerset, into a Huguenot merchant family. His father was Peter Caesar Labouchere and his mother Dorothy Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Francis Baring.  He was educated at Winchester College and Christ Church, Oxford, where he took his B. A.  (1821) and his M. In 1826, Labouchere became MP for St Michael, as a Whig. In 1830, he moved to the Taunton seat, which he held until 1859.  In 1835 he was opposed by Benjamin Disraeli for the Taunton seat; Labouchere won by 452 votes to 282.  He was first appointed to office by Lord Grey in 1832, serving as Civil Lord of the Admiralty . After beginning the second Melbourne ministry as Master of the Mint, Privy Counsellor, and Vice-President of the Board of Trade (and, later, Under-Secretary of State for War and the Colonies), Labouchere was raised to a cabinet post, President of the Board of Trade, which he held from 1839 until the Melbourne government fell in 1841. When the Whigs, now led by Lord John Russell, returned to office in 1846, Labouchere returned to the cabinet, this time as Chief Secretary for Ireland.  Under his administration the worst effects of the Great Irish Famine began to be felt in Ireland.  The following year, he once again became President of the Board of Trade, and stayed in that post until Russell's government fell in 1852. From 1853 to 1854 he sat on the Royal Commission on the City of London. Labouchere's final cabinet posting came during the first Palmerston ministry, for which he served as Secretary of State for the Colonies from 1855 to 1858. In 1859, Labouchere was raised to the peerage as Baron Taunton, of Taunton in the County of Somerset. Between 1864 and 1868 the then Lord Taunton chaired the Schools Enquiry Commission. In 1840 Labouchere married his first cousin Frances, daughter of Sir Thomas Baring.  They had three daughters: Frances snr died in 1850, aged 36.  In 1852 Labouchere married Lady Mary Howard (1823-1892) daughter of the Earl of Carlisle.  There were no children from this marriage. Lady Mary was buried at St Mary's Church, Charlynch, Somerset where a reredos was erected in 1893 in her memory. Taunton died in July 1869, aged 70, at his London house in Belgrave Square. He was buried near his country house Quantock Lodge at Over Stowey.  As he had no sons the barony became extinct on his death. His nephew, also Henry Labouchere, inherited part of Labouchere's fortune, and was later to become a well-known newspaper editor and politician.

Biography Laboucheres father, a Dutchman of Huguenot descent, became a partner in the leading Amsterdam mercantile firm of Hope, established a lucrative business connection by marrying into the Baring family and eventually retired to the life of an English landowner.  In 1824-5 Labouchere travelled through North America with the young Members John Evelyn Denison, Edward George Geoffrey Smith Stanley and John Stuart Wortley, acquiring 'a strong liking for American institutions and a genuine affection for the American people, and developing a particular interest in Canadian affairs.  Through the patronage of his uncle Alexander Baring, Member for Taunton, he was returned unopposed for Mitchell on the Hawkins interest at a by-election in April 1826.  He voted for reform of Edinburghs representation, 13 Apr. , revision of the corn laws, 18 Apr. , and parliamentary reform, 27 Apr.  1826.  At the general election that summer he was again returned unopposed for Mitchell.  His Whig allegiance was confirmed by his admission to Brookss Club, 25 Feb.  1827.  He voted against the duke of Clarences grant, 16 Feb.  1827.  He divided for Catholic relief, 6 Mar. , the spring guns bill, 23 Mar. , and further information on the conduct of the Lisburn magistrates, 29 Mar.  He voted to postpone the committee of supply pending the formation of a new ministry, 30 Mar.  He divided against Cannings coalition ministry to disfranchise Penryn, 28 May, but with them for the grant to improve water communications in Canada, 12 June 1827.  Writing to his friend Lord Sandon* at the end of the year, he expressed his willingness to support Lord Goderichs ministry 'without much trusting or esteeming them as a whole, for the sake of Huskisson and Lord Lansdowne.  He divided for repeal of the Test Acts, 6 Feb. , and Catholic relief, 12 May 1828.  He voted to transfer East Retfords seats to Birmingham, 21 Mar. , and for a lower pivot price on the corn duties sliding scale, 22 Apr.  In supporting the motion for a select committee on the civil government of Canada (to which he was named), 2 May, he urged the need to allay the fears of French settlers and hoped that in holding on to what Chatham and Wolfe had gained, 'we shall yet achieve a still more glorious victory, and more essentially English, by giving to the country we have conquered . . .  the advantages of our free and liberal institutions.  He spoke in favour of the grant to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospels in Canada and other colonies, 6 June, because he was unwilling to 'deprive the clergy in those colonies of the means of support, not because he wished 'to make the religion of the Church of England the dominant religion there.  He defended the grant for military works in Canada, 7 July, recognizing the need for prudent precautions against American attack and declaring that 'if we lose Canada, we shall most assuredly lose New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, and with them the whole of our extensive fisheries.  If this happened, 'then must the maritime greatness of England sink . . .  never again [to] be brought back to its former splendid eminence.  He presented a petition from inhabitants of Lower Canada against the repressive measures taken by the governor general, Lord Dalhousie, 14 July.  He voted against the Wellington ministry to omit the salary of the governor of Dartmouth Castle from the garrisons grant, 20 June, condemn the misapplication of public money for building work at Buckingham House, 25 June, and reduce the salary of the lieutenant-general of the ordnance, 4 July.  He divided against them on the silk duties, 14 July 1828.  He voted for the governments Catholic emancipation bill, 6, 30 Mar.  1829.  However, he opposed the clause requiring statements from Jesuits and members of other resident Catholic monastic orders, 'a paltry and unnecessary measure of security which marred a bill that 'upon the whole I admire with such fervency, 24 Mar.  He regarded it as 'the best colonial measure that ever passed the House, 30 Mar. , as it would mollify Irish emigrant communities and ensure that 'no other sentiments prevail amongst the entire population of our colonies than an undivided love for their country.  He pressed ministers to announce their intentions for the reform of Canadas civil government, in the light of the previous years select committee report, and to avoid disappointing the colonists expectations, 23 Feb. , 6 Apr. , 14 May.  On 5 June he declared that the Canadians were ready for 'a complete . . .  system of freedom, which should be 'given them under the shade of the British monarchy and of those admirable institutions which Mr.  Pitt gave to Canada, so that Britain might 'outbid America in purchasing the affections of the people.  He again supported the grant to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospels in the colonies, 6 Apr. , but warned it to be more cautious in its activities to avoid provoking irritation and suspicion.  He voted to transfer East Retfords seats to Birmingham, 5 May, reduce the additional grant for the sculpture of marble arch, 25 May, and lower the hemp duty, 1 June 1829.  He divided for Knatchbulls amendment to the address on distress, 4 Feb.  1830, and acted with the revived Whig opposition on most issues during that session.  He voted against Lord Blandfords reform scheme, 18 Feb. , but for the enfranchisement of Birmingham, Leeds and Manchester, 23 Feb. , the transfer of East Retfords seats to Birmingham, 5, 15 Mar. , and Russells reform motion, 28 May, when he was said to be 'pleased with the change and . . .  strong for reform.  He divided for Jewish emancipation, 5 Apr. , 17 May.  He demanded a thorough investigation of the pension list and warned that the country was likely to be disappointed at Parliaments failure to 'maintain . . .  strict economy in the public expenditure, 1 Mar.  However, he was against abolishing the treasurership of the navy, 12 Mar. , believing this to be tantamount to a censure of the government, although he hoped to see a check on the 'system of extravagance.  He voted to abolish the death penalty for forgery, 7 June, and opposed the Lords amendments to the forgeries punishment bill, criticizing ministers for not framing the measure properly, 20 July 1830.  Labouchere was active on issues relating to Canada and other colonies throughout that session.  He argued that reform of Canadian civil government would allow 'the present enormous military establishments there to be reduced, 19 Feb.  He agreed to put off his resolutions on Canada so as not to retard progress on the estimates, 25 Mar.  He was prepared to allow a first reading of the governments Canada bill, as so few Members were present, 29 Apr. , but indicated that he would oppose it at a later stage.  He declared that 'a complete alteration in the principle of the bill was needed, as it involved taxation to which the colonists would never submit, 14 June.  He brought forward his resolutions on 25 May, justifying his initiative on the ground that few other Members had a specialist interest in Canada.  He called for a reduction in the number of placemen in the legislative councils and the removal of judges from the executive councils, arguing that it was necessary to 'strike at the root itself of all abuse, which can only be corrected . . .  by placing in the hands of the Canadians themselves the unlimited management of their own internal concerns.  He was a teller for the motion, which was defeated by 153-94.  He announced that he now favoured phasing out the grant to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospels in Canada and other colonies, 14 June, believing it to be 'decidedly injurious to the Church of England, which was 'fading away through the jealousy and animosity . . .  excited against her.  That day he argued that the government should end the 'most unchristian practice of giving presents to the Canadian Indians in order to secure their service as military auxiliaries, maintaining that 'the Indians to whom the advantages of civilization have not yet been extended, are as barbarous in their system of warfare as in their mode of living.  He urged ministers to pledge themselves to a bill on Canadian revenues in the next session, 16 July.  He approved of those named as government commissioners to investigate abuses in colonial expenditure, 10 May.  He supported the motion for inquiry into the state of Newfoundland, where the 'greatest discontent existed, 11 May, and was a minority teller.  He endorsed a petition from the Cape of Good Hope for a representative system of government, 24 May, deploring the practice of 'sending out men of broken fortunes to occupy situations in the colonies.  In the debate on the civil establishment in the Bahamas, 11 June, he criticized the instinct to inject English ideas about the coexistence of monarchical, aristocratic and democratic elements into colonial constitutions, suggesting that 'our offspring will be more healthy and vigorous if we allow them to depend more on their own strength; he hastened to add that 'in this country I am no enemy to the aristocracy.  He urged the government to abolish the establishment at Sierra Leone for extinguishing the slave trade, which 'only grievously aggravates . . .  the horrors of that odious traffic, 20 July 1830.  In the absence of co-operation from other countries, he thought Britain should confine itself to 'preventing our own subjects from engaging in that traffic.  At the general election of 1830 Labouchere offered for Taunton on his uncles interest and was returned comfortably at the head of the poll.  He affirmed his determination to uphold 'the noble institutions of this country, by his 'readiness to apply to every part of them a searching but well-considered reform, to 'alleviate the burthens of the people, by enforcing 'a system of rigid economy in the public expenditure, and support 'a pacific system of foreign policy 'compatible with the national interests and honour.  He subsequently declared that while he would 'join in no factious opposition to the ministry, he was 'inclined to watch its conduct with great distrust, as he doubted whether it contained 'enough efficiency and ability adequately to do justice to the great and various interests of this empire.  He also welcomed the 'late glorious events in France, which had opened up 'a new and greater order of things to our view.  Privately, however, he suspected that 'if things get hot abroad it will not fail to produce a rally round the duke, and such language as that which Brougham and Graham have been indulging in will materially assist to produce such an effect.  The ministry of course reckoned Labouchere among their 'foes, and he duly voted against them in the crucial civil list division, 15 Nov.  1830.  He had tried unsuccessfully to extract information from them about the awaited report of the commission on finance and expenditure in the colonies, 5 Nov.  He presented a Taunton anti-slavery petition and urged Lord Greys new ministry to face up to this issue, 23 Nov.  He supported the grant for the Rideau Canal in Canada, regarding it as 'true economy to undertake these works and fortifications, 6 Dec.  1830.  He approved the ministerial resolutions on the government of Canada, 18 Feb.  1831, but wished to see the legislative council elected rather than nominated, arguing that 'our only course of governing Canada well, is not to govern it at all.  He questioned Goulburn, the former chancellor of the exchequer, over the granting of pensions by the Wellington ministry, 9 Dec. , and presented a Taunton petition for repeal of the assessed taxes, 17 Dec.  1830.  He criticized the spiralling expenditure on Windsor Castle and Buckingham House, 15 Feb.  1831, asserting that 'if one thing more than another has of late shaken the attachment of the people to monarchical institutions, it is these ill-advised buildings.  He was named to the select committee on the East India Company, 4 Feb.  (and again, 28 June 1831, 27 Jan. , 27 June 1832).  In presenting a Taunton petition for parliamentary reform, 14 Feb. , he said he was 'much disposed to support a great extension of suffrage, because I am desirous that the lower as well as the other classes should participate in the benefits of the constitution, and believe that their exclusion from the right of suffrage is neither just nor expedient.  He expressed his opposition to a Taunton petition for the ballot, which was likely to 'produce greater evils than it is intended to remove, 28 Feb. , but praised the willingness of Tauntons potwallopers to sacrifice their exclusive power by supporting an extended franchise, 7, 19 Mar. , 19 Apr.  He divided for the second reading of the ministrys reform bill, 22 Mar. , and against Gascoynes wrecking amendment, 19 Apr.  1831.  At the ensuing general election he and his Whig colleague Bainbridge received a 'cordial welcome at Taunton and were returned unopposed.  Labouchere denied that the reform bill would destroy the influence of the aristocracy, maintaining on the contrary that it would tend to place it on a sounder basis.  If the nobility wished to retain that influence, they would find that it was not to be done by secluding themselves, or trusting to their close boroughs, but by mixing with the people, and identifying themselves with the growing spirit and liberal sentiment of the age.  He believed that the people of England loved the crown and the constitutional nobility of the land, and considered their own liberties to be inseparably bound up with the just prerogative and privileges of the other orders of the state.  He divided for the second reading of the reintroduced reform bill, 6 July 1831, and steadily for its details, although he was in the minority to transfer Aldborough from schedule B to A, 14 Sept.  He presented a petition from certain householders of St.  Mary Magdalene, Taunton, for their inclusion in the borough, 8 July.  He opposed granting representation at Westminster to the colonies, 16 Aug. , arguing that it would be impossible for colonial Members to perform double duties and improper for them to vote on issues relating to English taxation; he denied that a reformed House of Commons would neglect colonial interests.  He opposed any alteration of the time for commencing parliamentary business and praised Lord Althorps handling of the bill, 27 Aug.  He divided for the third reading, 19 Sept.  Next day he admitted that he had 'belonged to that school which wished reform to take place gradually, but explained that after Wellingtons refusal to act 'the time for that course . . .  passed by.  Greys ministry had rightly displayed a 'prudent boldness by introducing 'a measure of a broad and extensive character . . .  which would give the hope of settling this great question.  He believed that in the future 'we may have a battle to fight between those who look upon all rights as usurpations and those who love and reverence existing institutions, but this could not be 'fought on the ground we now occupy, whereas in a reformed Parliament 'we shall be joined by all the public virtue and . . .  private worth of the country.  He voted for the bills passage, 21 Sept. , and Lord Ebringtons confidence motion, 10 Oct.  1831.  He supported the grant for salaries and allowances to certain Oxbridge professors for reading courses of lectures, 8 July 1831, as 'the benefits which [they] confer upon the country . . .  especially upon the poorer classes, are incalculable.  He pressed ministers to name a day for the third reading of the Canadian revenue bill, 8 July.  He again recommended phasing out the grant to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospels in the colonies, 25 July, as it tended 'to sow the seeds of religious dissension and civil discord; he also urged ministers to deal with the question of the clergy reserves and amend the charter of the University of Upper Canada.  That day he used a debate on Canadian canals to raise the colonists discontent at their system of civil government, arguing that the legislative councils must be reformed and pointing to the evils of a situation where an 'oligarchy of placeholders was able to appropriate executive and judicial offices for its party supporters.  He presented petitions from Lower Canada for the extinction of feudal rights in land and complaining of the legislative councils, the judicial system and the clergy reserves, 14 Oct.  He supported the motion to grant constitutional government to Newfoundland, which should be 'founded upon those broad principles of British liberty, 13 Sept.  He called for generous measures to relieve the people of Barbados and St.  Vincent following a hurricane, 13 Oct.  He questioned ministers as to whether the bill regulating child factory labour would apply to the silk industry, 6 Aug.  He voted in the minority to print the Waterford petition for disarming the Irish yeomanry, 11 Aug.  He presented petitions for omnibuses to be taxed as hackney cabs rather than stagecoaches, 16 Aug. , and to reduce the duty and relax the regulations on the picking up of passengers, 7 Sept. , when he observed that they were 'a great convenience to the lower classes of the metropolis.  He voted to punish only those guilty of bribery at the Dublin election and against censuring the Irish administration, 23 Aug.  He divided in the minority for an amendment to the motion for the Liverpool writ, which recognized that there had been gross bribery at the last general election, 5 Sept. , but he supported issuing the writ as it would inflict unfair hardship 'on the great trading and commercial interests of that town not to be fully represented in the House; he hoped the freemen would 'soon be visited with the punishment they deserve.  He voted in the minority against the quarantine duties, 6 Sept 1831.  Writing in late October 1831 from Brighton, where he had gone 'to put myself in complete repair after the labours of the session, Labouchere told a Tory friend that he saw no sign of 'reaction in the country, apart from the southern agricultural counties, and had 'no fear of disturbance from political excitement unless distress comes to its aid.  However, he was 'exceedingly afraid that during the winter political pains and contractions of all kinds will spread over the whole kingdom.  In the debate on the address, 12 Dec. , he expressed regret that the ministerial reform proposal did so little for Ireland, and feared that this neglect might 'strengthen the power of agitators and the discontented and afford a handle for still stronger language of complaint.  He ridiculed Sir Robert Peels argument that the Commons should be grateful to the Lords for giving them a chance to reconsider the reform bill, pointing out that the Lords might simply have amended the previous measure and so avoided provoking the public anger that had damaged respect for the upper House and the Church of England.  According to one observer, Labouchere 'spoke remarkably well and his retort to Peel was 'received with two distinct rounds of applause, while his comments about Ireland prompted other speakers to address that subject 'with still greater warmth.  He divided for the second reading of the revised bill, 17 Dec.  1831, and generally for its details.  However, he was in the minority for replacing Gateshead in schedule D with Merthyr Tydfil, 5 Mar.  1832, as he saw no reason to separate Gateshead from Newcastle but was conscious of the 'important interests at Merthyr, 'which have increased with a rapidity almost unparalleled and should be recognized as 'a matter of justice.  He divided for the third reading, 22 Mar. , and Ebringtons motion for an address asking the king to appoint only ministers committed to carrying an unimpaired measure, 10 May.  During the debate on this motion the previous day, he reportedly 'spoke violently, urging the Commons to 'place itself in the front of the battle, for we have arrived at a period when the great battle of reform must be fought and settled.  If a stand was not taken, 'I fear we shall see such scenes in this country as would make every man shudder.  He spoke on the ministerial crisis 'as an Englishman and . . .  an independent Member, 14 May, hoping that Grey would be reinstated and the 'honour and character of the country not injured by the spectacle of the Conservatives carrying a bill.  He presented a Taunton petition for the Commons to withhold supplies until the bill was passed, 24 May.  He voted for the second reading of the Irish bill, 25 May, and paired against increased representation for Scotland, 1 June 1832.  He presented a petition for abolition of the soap duty, which would 'contribute much to the benefit of the lower orders, 9 Dec.  1831, and urged ministers to consider 'making an extensive reduction of those taxes which press most severely on the springs of industry . . .  substituting in their place others which will fall principally on the richer classes of society, 28 Feb.  1832.  He stated that the silk manufacturers felt their case for exemption from Sadlers factory bill had not been fully heard, 15 Dec.  1831, and successfully proposed that Bainbridge be added to the committee on it to represent Somerset interests, 16 Mar.  1832.  He sided with ministers on the Russian-Dutch loan, 26 Jan. , 12, 16, 20 July.  In the debate on the Swan River colony in Australia, 17 Feb. , he regretted that it had been founded on 'incorrect principles and deprecated the 'system of composing the population of English colonies of the scourings of our gaols . . .  making them receptacles for vice and crime.  He welcomed the proposed relief grant to Barbados, St.  Vincent and Grenada, 29 Feb. , as these colonies had 'a claim upon the public bounty of the mother country.  He pressed Fowell Buxton to state how much compensation should be given to slave owners after emancipation, 15 Mar. , and presented a Taunton anti-slavery petition, 24 May.  He remarked on the frequent appointment of unsuitable persons to judicial offices in the colonies, 13 Apr. , questioned ministers about reduction in the 'excessive salary of the governor of Madras, 25 May, and welcomed their plans to dispense with the grant for ecclesiastical establishments in the North American colonies, 23 July.  He doubted whether the country would accept the general register bill, but acknowledged its potential benefits, 22 Feb.  He opposed the motion to place all English county Members on the resulting select committee, 6 Mar. , as he deemed it important to have a proper inquiry.  He presented petitions from the conservators of the River Tone and Tauntons inhabitants against the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal bill, 27 Feb. , when his motion to reject the second reading was defeated by 97-65; he was a minority teller.  He expressed indignation at 'the shameless and faithless conduct of Russia towards the Poles, which was 'shocking to humanity, 18 Apr. , and warned that 'until redress is obtained . . .  there can be no security for the preservation of the peace of Europe.  He voted to make coroners inquests public, 20 June 1832.  Laboucheres appointment as a lord of the admiralty in June 1832 marked the beginning of a long ministerial career.  He was re-elected unopposed at Taunton, where he hailed the Reform Act as 'a measure of justice . . .  freedom . . .  good order . . .  conciliation and . . .  peace.  He was again returned unopposed at the general election of 1832 and sat until 1859, when he was raised to the peerage as Baron Taunton.  He was said to be 'such a perfect gentleman that the Commons heard him 'with peculiar favour, and he was 'generally and highly respected as a 'zealous and able servant of the public, although he never reached 'the first rank of politics.  In 1839 he inherited from his father PS200,000 invested in securities, together with properties in Piccadilly and Essex and joint interests with Baring (now Lord Ashburton) in Maine, Pennsylvania and Louisiana; the total value of the estate was reputedly around PS500,000.  He had purchased an estate at Overstowey near Bridgwater, Somerset, in 1833, and made further acquisitions to consolidate his property, forming the so-called Quantock Lodge estate.  He died in July 1869 and his barony became extinct.  He left his estates in Somerset and Essex to his elder daughters Mary and Mina respectively.  His American estates were dealt with by a separate will, and it was presumably these which passed to his nephew Henry Labouchere (1831-1912), the maverick Radical Member for Windsor, 1865-6, Middlesex, 1867-8 and Northampton, 1880-1906.

In 1924 he travelled with Stanley, Denison and Stuart Wortley (afterwardsLords Derby, Ossington and Wharncliffe) through Canada and the United States. From 1826 to 1858 he sat in the House of Commons as Whig MP for MichaelBorough, then Taunton.

He was admitted to the Privy Council in 1835.  Whilein Parliament he drew attention to the abuses of the system of governmentin Canada, carried through the bill by which the Navigation Laws were repealed,and was instrumental in passing the Mercantile Marine Acts and the Seaman's Fund Act.  In 1858 he was created Baron Taunton of Taunton.  He served as oneof the commissioners for the Exhibition of 1851, and presided over thecommission appointed in 1853 to investigate the state of the Corporation ofthe City of London and also a commission inquiring into schools.  In 1840 he married Frances Baring, with whom he had three daughters.  Frances died in 1850,and in 1852 he married Lady Mary Matilda Georgiana Howard, with whom he had nochildren.

Rendell is best known for creating Chief Inspector Wexford. A second string of works was a series of unrelated crime novels that explored the psychological background of criminals and their victims.  This theme was developed further in a third series of novels, published under the pseudonym Barbara Vine. Rendell was born as Ruth Barbara Grasemann in 1930, in South Woodford, Essex (now Greater London). Her parents were teachers.  Her mother, Ebba Kruse, was born in Sweden to Danish parents and brought up in Denmark; her father, Arthur Grasemann, was English.  As a result of spending Christmas and other holidays in Scandinavia, Rendell learned Swedish and Danish. Rendell was educated at the County High School for Girls in Loughton, Essex, the town to which the family moved during her childhood.  After high school, she became a feature writer for her local Essex paper, the Chigwell Times.  However, she was forced to resign after filing a story about a local sports club dinner she hadn't attended and failing to report that the after-dinner speaker had died midway through the speech. Rendell met her husband Don Rendell when she was working as a newswriter. They married when she was 20, and in 1953 had a son, Simon, now a psychiatric social worker who lives in the U. S.  state of Colorado.  The couple divorced in 1975 but remarried two years later. Don Rendell died in 1999 from prostate cancer. She made the county of Suffolk her home for many years, using the settings in several of her novels.  She lived in the villages of Polstead and later Groton, both east of Sudbury.  She was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1996 Birthday Honours and a life peer as Baroness Rendell of Babergh, of Aldeburgh in the County of Suffolk, on 24 October 1997. She sat in the House of Lords for the Labour Party.  In 1998 Rendell was named on a list of the party's biggest private financial donors. She introduced into the Lords the bill that would later become the Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003 (the intent was to prevent the practice).  In August 2014, Rendell was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to The Guardian expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September's referendum on that issue. Baroness Rendell's awards include the Silver, Gold, and Cartier Diamond Daggers from the Crime Writers' Association, three Edgars from the Mystery Writers of America, The Arts Council National Book Awards, and The Sunday Times Literary Award. A number of her works (see the section below) have been adapted for film or television. She was also a patron of the charity Kids for Kids which helps children in rural areas of Darfur.  There is a blue plaque on one of her homes, 45 Millsmead Way, in Loughton.  This was unveiled by her son Simon on 24 February 2016. Four of her novels appear on the British-based Crime Writers Association Poll (1990) of the best crime fiction novels ever written: two under the Rendell name and two under her pen name of Barbara Vine. Rendell had a stroke on 7 January 2015 and died on 2 May 2015. The Ruth Rendell award was introduced in 2016 by the National Literacy Trust.  It is awarded to authors for their work in inspiring children and improving their literacy. Rendell wrote two unpublished novels before the 1964 publication of From Doon with Death, which was purchased for PS75 by John Long; it was the first mystery to feature Chief Inspector Reginald Wexford.  Rendell said that the character of Wexford was based on herself. The Monster in the Box, released in October 2009, was widely suggested to be Wexford's last case. This was incorrect; however it was the final novel featuring Wexford as an employed policeman.  In the two following novels, The Vault and No Man's Nightingale, he was retired but was still involved in police investigations as a \"consultant\". In Introducing Chief Inspector Wexford by Daniel Mallory he says (based on a 1990 interview with Rendell by Marilyn Stasio) that Rendell refers to the hated Agatha (Christie) and that awful Marple woman; and says of St.  Mary Mead that she can hardly bear to say the name of that village where one finds a lot of normal, law-abiding people living ordinary, blameless lives, who suddenly decide to murder their aunt.  Well, I dont believe that. (Introducing Chief Inspector Wexford by Daniel Mallory; from 1990 Rendell interview with Marilyn Stasio) In addition to these police procedurals starring Wexford, Rendell wrote psychological crime novels exploring such themes as romantic obsession, misperceived communication, the impact of chance and coincidence, and the humanity of the criminals involved.  Among such books are A Judgement in Stone, The Face of Trespass, Live Flesh, Talking to Strange Men, The Killing Doll, Going Wrong and Adam and Eve and Pinch Me.  For the last novel published in her lifetime, The Girl Next Door, she returned to the Loughton of her childhood, with an implied comparison of the moral climate of wartime England and 2014.  Rendell created a third strand of writing with the publication in 1986 of A Dark-Adapted Eye under her pseudonym Barbara Vine (the name was derived from her own middle name and her great grandmother's maiden name). King Solomon's Carpet, A Fatal Inversion and Asta's Book (alternative U. S.  title, Anna's Book), among others, inhabited the same territory as her psychological crime novels while further developing themes of human misunderstandings and the unintended consequences of family secrets and hidden crimes.  The author was noted for her elegant prose and sharp insights into the human mind, as well as her cogent plots and characters.  Rendell injected the social changes of the last 40 years into her work, bringing awareness to such issues as domestic violence. The Inspector Wexford series was successfully televised, starring George Baker as Inspector Wexford and Christopher Ravenscroft as Detective Mike Burden, under the title The Ruth Rendell Mysteries, with 48 episodes from 1987 to 2000.  Rendell praised Baker's performance, stating \"It was a marvellous achievement as an actor to make him more and better than the author intended. \" Many of her other works have been adapted for film and television.  She said that Chabrol's 1995 version of A Judgement in Stone, La Ceremonie with Sandrine Bonnaire, was one of the few film adaptations of her work that she was happy with.  The novel was also filmed in 1986 with Rita Tushingham. Chabrol made La Demoiselle d'honneur in 2004, based on The Bridesmaid.  Other adaptations are Diary of the Dead (1976), from the book One Across, Two Down; the 1997 Pedro Almodovar film Live Flesh; The Tree of Hands, directed by Giles Foster for Granada with Lauren Bacall (U. S.  title: \"Innocent Victim\"); and another version of The Tree of Hands, Betty Fisher et autres histoires (2001, a. k. a.  Alias Betty), with screenplay and direction by Claude Miller.  Francois Ozon's 2015 film The New Girlfriend was based on Rendell's short story of the same name. Two episodes of Tales of the Unexpected were based on Rendell's short stories - \"A Glowing Future\" (series 4, episode 15) and \"People Don't Do Such Things\" (series 8, episode 1).

Rendell initially worked as a reporter and copy editor for West Essex newspapers.  Her first novel, From Doon with Death (1964), introduced Wexford, the clever chief inspector of a town in southeastern England, and his more stodgy associate Mike Burden.  The pair appear in more than 20 additional novels of police procedure, among them No More Dying Then (1971), An Unkindness of Ravens (1985), The Veiled One (1988), Road Rage (1997), The Babes in the Wood (2002), Not in the Flesh (2007), and No Mans Nightingale (2013).  In 1990 the Wexford stories were first adapted for television.  Britannica Quiz Women in Entertainment and the Arts Stars may dazzle onstage, onscreen, and on radio, but their stories are so much more complex.  How much do you know about these entertaining and artistic women? In time Rendells psychological thrillers, which present the inner lives of complex characters as they move incrementally toward violent actions, became at least as popular as the Wexford series.  Sexual obsession, immaturity, exaggerated fantasy lives, and the gap between parent and child are recurring elements in such novels as A Judgement in Stone (1977), The Lake of Darkness (1980), Talking to Strange Men (1987), and The Bridesmaid (1989).  Rendell also wrote tense short stories such as the Edgar Award-winning \"The New Girl Friend\" and the collection Blood Lines: Long and Short Stories (1995).  She produced several novels under the pseudonym Barbara Vine, including King Solomons Carpet (1991), The Brimstone Wedding (1995), Grasshopper (2000), The Birthday Present (2008), and The Childs Child (2012).  Her other works include The Crocodile Bird (1993), The Keys to the Street (1996), The Rottweiler (2003), The Waters Lovely (2006), and The Girl Next Door (2014).  Rendell was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1996 and was made a life peer in 1997. ", "article_2": "Unlikely or not, Wexford was Ms.  Rendells alter ego, she said in a video statement for Simon & Schuster: \"Im not creating a character so much as putting myself as a man on the page. \" The author once said she imagined Wexford as a rather taciturn \"big, ugly man. \" As Wexfords caseload grew book by book, Ms.  Rendell tried to make him grow as well, becoming \"a bit less tough, a bit more tolerant. \" Chief Inspector Wexford was almost christened Waterford, as Ms.  Rendell recalled.  On vacation in Ireland, she visited both Wexford and Waterford and decided that either would be acceptable for her sleuths surname.  So, how did she settle on \"Wexford\"? \"I dont know why,\" she said.  \"I guess I just like the letter 'X.  \" Ms.  Rendell also wrote a score of stand-alone novels, typically featuring protagonists on the edges of society.  One, the psychological thriller \"Live Flesh,\" was adapted as a 1997 film by Pedro Almodovar.  From her earliest writing days, Ms.  Rendell wanted to do more than create puzzles revolving around who killed whom and why.  So, as she recalled for Simon & Schuster, she laced her mysteries with such themes as racism in the English countryside, damage to the environment, domestic violence and arranged marriages among immigrants.  She acknowledged worrying early on that her readers might not like her delving into such serious issues.  \"But they did,\" she said.  \"They wrote to me and told me that they did. \" Ms.  Rendell began writing as Barbara Vine with her 1986 novel \"A Dark-Adapted Eye,\" a story of family secrets set in World War II.  The novel was so different from what she had been doing that the author thought she needed a nom de plume.  As The Guardian noted, Ms.  Rendell saw Barbara Vine as \"a bit more serious, a bit more searching, analytical perhaps. \" Ms.  Rendell eschewed gratuitous violence in her works.  Yet she could create hair-raising suspense as she did, for instance, in \"Master of the Moor,\" her 1982 novel about particularly grisly killings in a community of tormented souls.  And she had a taste for the macabre, demonstrated for example in \"Not in the Flesh,\" her 2007 novel that opens with a truffle hound finding a human hand in a patch of woods.

Born on February 17, 1930 in South Woodford, London, Ruth Barbara Grasemann, is an English author who focuses on the genres of thriller and psychological murder mysteries.  At age 83, Ruth has already completed a vast library of books including 24 novels in the Inspector Wexford series, 26 standalone novels, two novellas, 14 novels written under the pen name Barbara Vine, nine short-story collections, one uncollected short story, one childrens fiction, and three nonfiction novels.  Ruth attended high school at Loughton County High School in Essex.  After she graduated from Loughton County High, Ruth attempted to be a feature reporter for the local newspaper, The Chigwell Times, but that career was short-lived after a couple of mishaps due to her irresistible urge to make up fictional stories.  During her career as a news writer, Ruth met her husband, Don Rendell.  After getting married at the age of twenty, they had a son, named Simon.  In 1975, after 25 years of marriage, they divorced only to remarry two years later.  The Beginning of Inspector Wexford Chief Inspector Reginald Wexford is a fictional character and is claimed to be an intelligent sensitive man.  His wifes name is Dora, and he has two daughters named Sheila and Sylvia with whom he has a difficult time getting along with.  The famous Wexford series begins with Ruths novel, From Doon with Death which was published in 1964.  In this novel, that later became a movie in 1988, Inspector Wexford investigates the death of Margaret Parsons, after discovering a number of letters from the mysterious Doon.  Since this publication, Inspector Wexford has gone on to star in more than 20 other novels by Ruth, however; he did not play a role in her second novel, To Fear a Painted Devil, which was published a year after From Doon with Death.  In the television series of From Doon with Death, Inspector Wexford is played by George Baker.  The 60s During the 1960s, Along with her first and second novel, Ruth was also able to write five others.  These included three more additions to the Wexford series; A New Lease of Death and Wolf to Slaughter in 1967, and The Best Man To Die which was published in 1969.  In 1965, Ruth also published Vanity Dies Hard, and The Secret House of Death in 1968.  The 70s During the 1970s Ruth was able to complete six more Wexford novels, five more standalone novels, and two short story collections.

In fact, Ruth received more awards during the 1980s than any other two decades combined.  In 1980, she received both the Mystery Writers of America Edgar Award and the Martin Beck Award for Make Death Love Me.  In 1981, Ruth received the Arts Council National Book Award for Genre fiction for The Lake of Darkness.

From 1964, when her country copper, Reg Wexford, first stepped before the reading public in From Doon With Death, she wrote more than 50 crime novels and seven books of short stories.  Many of them were adapted for television or made into feature films; the Wexford books in particular were an enormous success on TV, with the actor George Baker playing Wexford as a big, gruff, rural policeman, solving crime in the fictional Sussex town of Kingsmarkham.  But Rendell was never satisfied with producing the annual whodunnit.  She demonstrated this when, rather than follow her first Wexford novel with more of the same, she daringly jumped away from the classic English mystery in her second book, To Fear a Painted Devil (1965), and gave readers a taste of the psychological thrillers to come.  The cliched view of Rendell is that she suddenly changed her style when, in the 1980s, she started writing as Barbara Vine, but the truth is that from the beginning, even in the Wexford tales, she concentrated more on character and psychology than old-fashioned police procedure.  She wrote 24 Wexford books and produced an equal number of thrillers under the name Rendell.  Her first novel as Barbara Vine was A Dark-Adapted Eye (1986), which won the Mystery Writers of Americas Edgar Allan Poe award.  The next year, a second Barbara Vine, A Fatal Inversion, won her the Crime Writers Association Golden Dagger.  The big difference with the Barbara Vine stories was that in them she went inside the heads of her psychopathic killers and rapists.  It was this that made them so dark and chilling, an uncomfortable read for fans of Wexford who were used to the protection of the country officer standing between them and an unsafe world.  Because of this, Rendells fans fell into two rather warring camps, those who liked the Wexford stories and those who felt that Barbara Vine was a great \"real\" novelist breaking new ground.  The books were all, however, bestsellers.  There might also have been a third camp, those who loved her wonderful short stories.  This was a dying, or dead, market in Britain, but Rendell was able to sell short stories in the US to publications such as the Ellery Queen Mystery Magazine.  Although Rendell did not like the title often bestowed on her - queen of crime - calling it snide and sexist, she did not go along with the many reviewers, among them AN Wilson and PD James, who called her a great novelist.  \"Nobody in their senses is going to call me a first-class writer,\" she said.  \"I dont mind because I do the very best that I can and thousands, millions of people enjoy my books. \" George Baker as Detective Chief Inspector Reg Wexford and Louie Ramsay as Dora Wexford in ITVs The Ruth Rendell Mysteries, 1988.  Photograph: ITV/Rex Features A very private person, who could get prickly with interviewers, she nevertheless said that she was going to take an active part in politics when she was made a life peer in 1997.  That year she had given PS10,000 to the Labour election campaign.  In the Lords, Rendell supported the bill to legalise assisted suicide: \"The way Im going it wont be long, but all my aunts lived into their 90s. \".  Daughter of Ebba (nee Krause) and Arthur Grasemann, she was born in South Woodford, north-east London.  Her mother, who had been born in Sweden and lived in Denmark until she was 12, was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and Ruth, an only child, was brought up in part by a housekeeper to whom, she said, she was much closer than she was to her mother.  Her father she described as \"endlessly patient, endlessly loving, and endlessly kind\".  She put a lot of him into Wexford.  She went to Loughton high school, in Essex, and was, she said, very unhappy.  But she began to find herself when she left school and became a journalist.  She worked on the Chigwell Times and by the age of 22 was a top reporter.  Trouble came her way when she wrote a story about an old deserted house and invented a ghost; the owner of the house threatened to sue.  Shortly afterwards she skipped the annual meeting of a local tennis club and wrote the story up from the chairmans pre-prepared speech of which she had a copy.  After her piece appeared in print she learned that the chairman had dropped dead of a heart attack in the middle of delivering it.  She quit before she was sacked.  Aged 20 she had married Don Rendell, a reporter whom she met when they were both covering an inquest.  He became a financial journalist on the Daily Mail and for 10 years Rendell was a wife and mother.  She described these as happy years but during that time she went through a long apprenticeship, writing six novels, all of which were rejected.  When her seventh, From Doon With Death, was accepted by the small publishing house of John Long, she received PS75 for it.  \"No interviews then,\" she said, \"nor for the next two novels. \" Later she was frequently interviewed, though she was never a willing subject.  Asked once too often what she would have been if she hadnt become a novelist, she said a country and western singer.  It came as a shock when, during an interview oon Norwegian TV, she was handed a microphone and asked to sing.  Asked on BBC Radio 4 about how she wrote her short stories, she said: \"Oh they just come to me. \" She described what drove her to write by saying: \"I like to sit at a desk and type. \" Rendell claimed that, when writing her novels, she never did any research but \"simply made things up\".  Later on, she hired a researcher, but the great detail she gave her stories was the result, she said, of going on long walks, especially in London.  She became an expert on parks in the capital.  Her hobby was changing houses; she moved 18 times.  For several years, she lived in a pink 16th-century manor house set in 11 acres in Suffolk, before returning to London.  Her only digression from a rather set, humdrum routine came when in 1975 she divorced her husband and then two years later remarried him.  Asked why, she said that after they separated, she found she couldnt live without him, because he was the sort of man with whom you could go on a 200-mile car trip and never have to say a word.  The Mystery Writers of America gave her three Edgars and the British Crimewriters Association awarded her several Golden and Silver Daggers.  In 1991 she received the Cartier Diamond award for outstanding contribution to the crime genre.  She showed no sign of slowing up: No Mans Nightingale, published in 2013, was a classic Wexford; and in 2014 she created a new detective, Colin Quell, for The Girl Next Door.  Rendell was very generous and gave a large amount of money away.  She was vice-president of the housing charity Shelter and raised money for Little Hearts Matter, which helps children with heart disease.  She said she knew what it was like to have no cash, adding: \"I dont think its good for people to be born into money and not know what it is never to have it. \" Her husband died in 1999.  She is survived by her son, Simon. "}}

He was one of the leaders of the Moderate Republicans and served as Prime Minister of France from 1880 to 1881 and 1883 to 1885.  He was a promoter of laicism and colonial expansion. Under the Third Republic, Ferry made primary education free and compulsory through several new laws. However, he was forced to resign following the Sino-French War in 1885 due to his unpopularity and public opinion against the war. Early life and family  Ferry was born in Saint-Die, in the Vosges department, to Charles-Edouard Ferry, a lawyer from a family that had established itself in Saint-Die as bellmakers, and Adelaide Jamelet. His paternal grandfather, Francois-Joseph Ferry, was mayor of Saint-Die through the Consulate and the First Empire. He studied law, and was called to the bar at Paris in 1854, but soon went into politics, contributing to various newspapers, particularly to Le Temps.  He attacked the Second French Empire with great violence, directing his opposition especially against Baron Haussmann, prefect of the Seine department.  A series of his articles in Le Temps was later republished as The Fantastic Tales of Haussmann (1868). Elected republican deputy for Paris in 1869, he protested against the declaration of war with Germany, and on 6 September 1870 was appointed prefect of the Seine by the Government of National Defense. In this position, he had the difficult task of administering Paris during the siege, and after the Paris Commune was obliged to resign (5 June 1871).  From 1872 to 1873 he was sent by Adolphe Thiers as minister to Athens, but returned to the chamber as deputy for the Vosges, and became one of the leaders of the Opportunist Republicans.  When the first republican ministry was formed under W.  H.  Waddington on 4 February 1879, he was one of its members, and continued in the ministry until 30 March 1885, except for two short interruptions (from 10 November 1881 to 30 January 1882, and from 29 July 1882 to 21 February 1883), first as minister of education and then as minister of foreign affairs.  A leader of the Opportunist Republicans faction, he was twice premier (1880-1881 and 1883-1885). He was an active Freemason initiated on 8 July 1875, in \"La Clemante amitiee\" lodge in Paris the same day as Emile Littre. He became a member of the \"Alsace-Lorraine\" Lodge founded in Paris in 1782. Two important works are associated with his administration: the non-clerical organization of public education, and the major colonial expansion of France.  Ferry believed the path to a modernized and prosperous France lay in the triumph of reason over religion.  School reforms were a key part of his plan. Following the republican program, he proposed to destroy the influence of the clergy in universities and found his own system of republican schooling.  He reorganized the committee of public education (law of 27 February 1880) and proposed a regulation for the conferring of university degrees, which, though rejected, aroused violent polemics because the 7th article took away from the unauthorized religious orders the right to teach.  He finally succeeded in passing his eponymous laws of 16 June 1881 and 28 March 1882, which made primary education in France free, non-clerical (laique) and mandatory.  In higher education, the number of professors called the \"Republic's black hussars\" (French: hussards noirs de la Republique) because of their Republican support, doubled under his ministry. After the military defeat of France by Prussia in 1870, Ferry formed the idea of acquiring a great colonial empire, principally for the sake of economic exploitation. In 1882 Jules Ferry, as Minister of Public Instruction, decided to create a mission to explore the Regency of Tunisia.  The expedition was headed by the botanist Ernest Cosson and included the botanist Napoleon Doumet-Adanson and other naturalists.  In 1884 a geological section under Georges Rolland was added to the Tunisian Scientific Exploration Mission.  Rolland was assisted by Philippe Thomas from 1885 and by Georges Le Mesle in 1887.  In a speech on the colonial empire before the Chamber of Deputies on 28 March 1884, he declared that \"it is a right for the superior races, because they have a duty.  They have the duty to civilize the inferior races. \" Ferry directed the negotiations which led to the establishment of a French protectorate in Tunis (1881), prepared the treaty of 17 December 1885 for the occupation of Madagascar; directed the exploration of the Congo and of the Niger region; and above all, he organized the conquest of Annam and Tonkin in what became Indochina. The last endeavor led to a war with Qing dynasty China, which had a claim of suzerainty over the two provinces.  The excitement caused in Paris by the sudden retreat of the French troops from Lang Son during this war led to the Tonkin Affair: his violent denunciation by Clemenceau and other radicals, and his downfall on 30 March 1885.  Although the treaty of peace with the Chinese Empire (9 June 1885), in which the Qing dynasty ceded suzerainty of Annam and Tonkin to France, was the work of his ministry, he would never again serve as premier.  The desire for a monarchy was strong in France in the early years of the Third Republic - Henri, Count of Chambord having made a bid early in its history.  A committed republican, Ferry proceeded to a wide-scale \"purge\" by dismissing many known monarchists from top positions in the magistrature, army, and civil and diplomatic service.  In the 1890s he visited Algeria and provided a critical report.  He predicted that Algeria could not escape a conflict between Indigenes and Europeans: He was interested in providing education to the Indigenes, while the settlers were skeptical about this topic.  He was given a poor image of the settlers because they did not want to pay taxes.  He also noted that the Indigene was contributing to the Communes de plein exercice without profiting of it.  without profiting of it.  He considered the settlers were poorly chosen, and that they were too numerous He was in favor of the self-government of Algeria but considered the settler were not enough educated to do so He considered that the Muslims did not want French citizenship, Military service, French mandatory schools, civil French law.  He considered that the Muslims wanted fewer taxes, taxes more used for their needs, the authority of the cadis , Muslim city councilors involvement in Mayor election , Muslim city councilors involvement in Mayor election He also considered that the Land laws were a failure. The key to understanding Ferry's unique position in Third Republic history is that until his political critic, Georges Clemenceau became Prime Minister twice in the 20th century, Ferry had the longest tenure as Prime Minister under that regime.  He also played with political dynamite that eventually destroyed his success.  Ferry (like his 20th-century equivalent Joseph Caillaux) believed in not confronting Wilhelmine Germany by threats of a future war of revenge.  Most French politicians in the middle and right saw it as a sacred duty to one day lead France again against Germany to reclaim Alsace-Lorraine, and avenge the awful defeat of 1870.  But Ferry realized that Germany was too powerful, and it made more sense to cooperate with Otto von Bismarck and avoid trouble.  A sensible policy - but hardly popular.  Bismarck was constantly nervous about the situation with France.  Although he had despised the ineptness of the French under Napoleon III and the government of Adolphe Thiers and Jules Favre, he had not planned for all the demands he presented the French in 1870.  He only wished to temporarily cripple France by the billion franc reparation, but suddenly he was confronted by the demands of Marshals Albrecht von Roon and Helmut von Moltke (backed by Emperor Wilhelm I) to annex the two French provinces as further payment.  Bismarck, for all his abilities regarding manipulating events, could not afford to anger the Prussian military.  He got the two provinces, but he realized it would eventually have severe future repercussions.  Bismarck was able to ignore the French for most of the 1870s and early 1880s, but as he found problems with his three erstwhile allies (Austria, Russia, and Italy), he realized France might one day take advantage of this (as it did with Russia in 1894).  When Ferry came up with a radically different approach to the situation and offered an olive branch, Bismarck reciprocated.  A Franco-German friendship would alleviate problems of siding with either Austria or Russia, or Austria and Italy.  Bismarck approved of the colonial expansion that France pursued under Ferry.  He only had some problems with local German imperialists who were critical that Germany lacked colonies, so he found a few in the 1880s, making certain he did not confront French interests.  But he also suggested Franco-German cooperation on the imperial front against the British Empire, thus hoping to create a wedge between the two Western European great powers.  It did, as a result, leading to a major race for influence across Africa that nearly culminated in war in the next decade, at Fashoda in the Sudan in 1898.  But by then both Bismarck and Ferry were dead, and the rapprochement policy died when Ferry lost office.  As for Fashoda, while it was a confrontation, it led to Britain and France eventually discussing their rival colonial goals, and agreeing to support each other's sphere of influence - the first step to the Entente Cordiale between the countries in 1904. Ferry remained an influential member of the moderate republican party, and directed the opposition to General Boulanger.  After the resignation of Jules Grevy (2 December 1887), he was a candidate for the presidency of the republic, but the radicals refused to support him, and he withdrew in favor of Sadi Carnot.  On 10 December 1887, a man named Aubertin attempted to assassinate Jules Ferry, who would later die on 17 March 1893 from complications attributed to this wound.  The Chamber of Deputies gave him a state funeral.

Ferry pursued his fathers profession of law and was called to the Paris bar in 1855.  Soon, however, he made a name for himself as a biting critic of the Second Empire, especially by his articles (1867-68) in the newspaper Le Temps attacking Baron George-Eugene Haussmanns administration of Paris.

Find out who really invented movable type, who Winston Churchill called \"Mum,\" and when the first sonic boom was heard.  During the Franco-German War (1870-71), Ferry administered the departement of Seine, holding the powers of prefect, and was appointed mayor of Paris in November 1870.  His administration of the besieged and hungry capital won him the nickname \"Ferry-la-Famine,\" which haunted him the rest of his life.  Ferry was minister to Greece (1872-73) and thereafter for six years was in the republican opposition to the conservative governments and to the presidency of Patrice Mac-Mahon.  He then held several offices, serving twice (1880-81, 1883-85) as premier and once (1883-85) as minister of foreign affairs.  Ferry is best known for his governments establishment of free, compulsory, secular education, brought about mainly by a law of 1882.  This policy was accompanied by other anticlerical measures, notably decrees (1880-81) dissolving the Jesuits and other congregations not authorized under the Concordat of 1801 between France and the papacy and forbidding their members to direct or teach in any educational establishment.  Ferry also played a major part in the dramatic extension of Frances colonial territories.  Ferry and a few enthusiastic colonialists, in the face of popular apathy or hostility, were largely responsible for France acquiring Tunisia (1881), northern and central Vietnam (Tonkin and Annam; 1883), Madagascar (1885), and the French Congo (1884-85).  Public anger over the continuing expenditures needed to complete the conquest of Tonkin swept Ferry from office in March 1885.  Despite continuing unpopularity, he was elected to the Senate by Vosges in 1891 and became its president in 1893.  The violent polemics aroused against him at this time, however, caused a madman to shoot him, and he died from the wound. ", "article_2": "Modern History Sourcebook: Jules Ferry (1832-1893): On French Colonial Expansion Ferry was twice prime minister of France, from [1880-1881, 1883-1885].  He is especially remembered for championing laws that removed Catholic influence from most education in France and for promoting a vast extension of the French colonial empire.  The policy of colonial expansion is a political and economic system . . .  that can be connected to three sets of ideas: economic ideas; the most far-reaching ideas of civilization; and ideas of a political and patriotic sort.  In the area of economics, I am placing before you, with the support of some statistics, the considerations that justify the policy of colonial expansion, as seen from the perspective of a need, felt more and more urgently by the industrialized population of Europe and especially the people of our rich and hardworking country of France: the need for outlets [for exports].  Is this a fantasy? Is this a concern [that can wait] for the future? Or is this not a pressing need, one may say a crying need, of our industrial population? I merely express in a general way what each one of you can see for himself in the various parts of France.  Yes, what our major industries [textiles, etc. ], irrevocably steered by the treaties of 18601 into exports, lack more and more are outlets.  Why? Because next door Germany is setting up trade barriers; because across the ocean the United States of America have become protectionists, and extreme protectionists at that; because not only are these great markets . . .  shrinking, becoming more and more difficult of access, but these great states are beginning to pour into our own markets products not seen there before.  This is true not only for our agriculture, which has been so sorely tried . . .  and for which competition is no longer limited to the circle of large European states . . . .  Today, as you know, competition, the law of supply and demand, freedom of trade, the effects of speculation, all radiate in a circle that reaches to the ends of the earth . . . .  That is a great complication, a great economic difficulty; . . .  an extremely serious problem.  It is so serious, gentlemen, so acute, that the least informed persons must already glimpse, foresee, and take precautions against the time when the great South American market that has, in a manner of speaking, belonged to us forever will be disputed and perhaps taken away from us by North American products.  Nothing is more serious; there can be no graver social problem; and these matters are linked intimately to colonial policy.  Gentlemen, we must speak more loudly and more honestly! We must say openly that indeed the higher races have a right over the lower races . . . .  I repeat, that the superior races have a right because they have a duty.  They have the duty to civilize the inferior races . . . .  In the history of earlier centuries these duties, gentlemen, have often been misunderstood; and certainly when the Spanish soldiers and explorers introduced slavery into Central America, they did not fulfill their duty as men of a higher race . . . .  But, in our time, I maintain that European nations acquit themselves with generosity, with grandeur, and with sincerity of this superior civilizing duty.  I say that French colonial policy, the policy of colonial expansion, the policy that has taken us under the Empire [the Second Empire, of Napoleon 1111, to Saigon, to Indochina [Vietnam], that has led us to Tunisia, to Madagascar-I say that this policy of colonial expansion was inspired by. . .  the fact that a navy such as ours cannot do without safe harbors, defenses, supply centers on the high seas . . . .  Are you unaware of this? Look at a map of the world.  Gentlemen, these are considerations that merit the full attention of patriots.  The conditions of naval warfare have greatly changed . . . .  At present, as you know, a warship, however perfect its design, cannot carry more than two weeks' supply of coal; and a vessel without coal is a wreck on the high seas, abandoned to the first occupier.  Hence the need to have places of supply, shelters, ports for defense and provisioning. . . .  And that is why we needed Tunisia; that is why we needed Saigon and Indochina; that is why we need Madagascar. . .  and why we shall never leave them! . . .  Gentlemen, in Europe such as it is today, in this competition of the many rivals we see rising up around us, some by military or naval improvements, others by the prodigious development of a constantly growing population; in a Europe, or rather in a universe thus constituted, a policy of withdrawal or abstention is simply the high road to decadence! In our time nations are great only through the activity they deploy; it is not by spreading the peaceable light of their institutions . . .  that they are great, in the present day.  Spreading light without acting, without taking part in the affairs of the world, keeping out of all European alliances and seeing as a trap, an adventure, all expansion into Africa or the Orient-for a great nation to live this way, believe me, is to abdicate and, in less time than you may think, to sink from the first rank to the third and fourth.

He founded the magazines The Lady and the English Vanity Fair, and became a Member of Parliament in 1892.  He was also the maternal grandfather of the Mitford sisters. Bowles was the illegitimate offspring of Thomas Milner Gibson and a servant named Susannah Bowles.  He attended school in France and then studied for a year at King's College London.  His father gave him a yearly stipend of PS90 and helped him find a job at Somerset House. He began his journalism and publishing career by writing a column for the Morning Post in 1866.  His coverage of the Siege of Paris sent by balloon and pigeon post ensured his fame. He borrowed PS200 to found Vanity Fair in 1868.  Shattered by the death of his wife Jessica (nee Evans-Gordon) in childbirth, he sold his stake in Vanity Fair to Arthur H.  Evans in 1887 for PS20,000.  He founded The Lady magazine in 1885, supposedly spurred by advice Jessica had once given to him.  He became a competent sailor and wrote for decades in support of the Royal Navy.  Bowles (nicknamed Jehu Junior after a biblical prophet who effected the downfall of his enemies) compiled the biographical notes that went with the caricatures.  He was editor for twenty years and shaped magazine policy so that no-one was exempt from his enquiring eye.  This approach made for an entertaining and popular magazine. The targets of Jehu Junior's satire usually considered themselves honoured to have been chosen, and although the scrutiny was acute, it was humorous rather than malicious.  Bowles managed to achieve this extraordinarily difficult balancing act throughout his association with the magazine. At the 1892 general election, he was elected as Conservative Party Member of Parliament for King's Lynn and served in the House of Commons until losing his seat at the 1906 election.  He was re-elected at the January 1910 as a Liberal, but lost his seat again at the December 1910 election.  He stood in the 1916 Harborough by-election as an independent. In 1875, he married Jessica Evans-Gordon (1852-1887), daughter of General Charles Evans-Gordon (1813-1901), a descendant of \"Gordon of Lochinvar\", and his wife Catherine (nee Rose) Evans-Gordon.  His wife's brother, Sir William Evans-Gordon, also sat as a Conservative MP from 1900 to 1907.  Before her death in 1887, they were the parents of: He died on 12 January 1922 while on a holiday at Algeciras, Spain, and is buried in Gibraltar. Through his elder daughter Sydney, he was a grandfather of Nancy, Pamela, Thomas, Diana, Unity, Jessica, and Deborah Mitford. According to his granddaughter Julia Budworth, Bowles also fathered the last three of the four children of assistant Rita Shell (his children's governess, after the death of his wife Jessica Evans-Gordon), who changed her surname to Stewart.  She later became editor of The Lady.  They were Humphrey (b.  1891), Oliver (b.  1895) and Peter (b.  1900).

Its premise is summarized by the Tate: \"In the 1870s, France was devastated by the Franco-Prussian war and insurrection in Paris, driving artists to seek refuge across the Channel.  Their experiences in London and the friendships that developed not only influenced their own work but also contributed to the British art scene. \" The exhibition is huge, and the galleries were crowded on each of the two days I visited.  There is a great deal of beauty on display, but its also a very ambitious, cerebral show, so you have to pace yourself.  James Tissot fought to defend Paris in the Franco-Prussian War, served as a stretcher-bearer, participated in the bloody Commune the following spring, and fled to London in June, 1871.  For me, this show was an opportunity to view several works by Tissot never before displayed in public, as well as many of Tissots most intriguing oil paintings in a single venue.  These have been cleaned for the occasion, and the colors are as vibrant as if theyd been newly painted.  I was one of many visitors transfixed by the restored beauty of Tissots brushwork and the details revealed.  Ive created the following virtual tour for those who cannot make it to London to see this - or who have not yet seen it, and may soon.  Commentary is mine unless otherwise noted.  In the first gallery of the exhibition, with its walls painted a somber aubergine, I was one of many fascinated by sketches and watercolors Tissot made during the Franco-Prussian War.  Since I have a special interest in his life and work during the war, the Siege of Paris, and the Commune, Im afraid I may have impeded traffic in this section of the gallery.  For additional information on this tumultuous period, see my posts: James Tissot and The Artists Brigade, 1870-71 Paris, June 1871 London, June 1871 The Artists Rifles, London Tissots elegant watercolor, The Wounded Soldier (c.  1870), acquired by the Tate in 2016, is a singularly beautiful image of a restless young man in uniform perched on the arm of a sofa.  Thanks to the staff in the Tate Study Room, I had a chance to view this work closely on an earlier visit to London in the weeks before this exhibition.  It likely was painted within the city walls of Paris, where the wounded were brought to convalesce in public buildings.  The Wounded Soldier is James Tissots most sensitive, profound, and arresting work and shows him in a new light.  The exhibition text notes that he kept it in his studio all his life, never exhibiting it.  This is the first time it has been displayed in public.  Photography is prohibited in the exhibition, but click here to see an image of it.  In the bitter aftermath of the war, French citizens engaged in a bloody uprising against the new republican government.  My research indicates that Tissot participated in the Commune in some way, and like many of his peers, including Manet, Degas and Renoir, he seemed sympathetic to the plight of the Communards when the government ended the standoff with mass executions.  Tissot, renowned for painting the ruffles and ribbons of womens fashions, documented this period in French history in a way no one else did.  The exhibition features his eyewitness account in watercolor, The Execution of Communards by French Government Forces at Fortifications in the Bois de Boulogne, 29 May 1871 (private collection), displayed in public for the first time.  This horrifying image was sent along with a letter to Lady Waldegrave (1821 - 1879), a prominent Liberal hostess in London whom Tissot likely met through J. E.  Millais, if not his friend Tommy Bowles (Thomas Gibson Bowles (1841 - 1922).  The letter has been expertly translated from the original French by the exhibition curator, Dr.  Caroline Corbeau-Parsons, Assistant Curator 1850-1915 at Tate Britain.  In it, Tissot writes a graphic stream-of-consciousness narrative of executions of Communards, or suspected Communards, by government soldiers.  Dr.  Corbeau-Parsons, who organized the exhibition, notes that his \"broken language\" and his lack of grammatically correct accents betrays how traumatized he was in witnessing this horror, and yet Tissot is surprisingly thorough in relating this experience to Lady Waldegrave.  Exhibition visitors stop to read this translated letter in its entirety.  There is so little documentation on Tissot that it is as if he finally has a voice; otherwise, his work must speak for itself.  But this exhibition, with its new works by Tissot, gives him a chance to do that.  Passing through the second gallery, which refreshes the mood of the exhibition with its sky blue walls, I found my gold mine of Tissots oils in the spacious third room, where the tan walls come alive with his colors.  First, take a look at the smaller items that rarely (if ever) have been displayed in public.  Here, you will find Tissots sketch of the handsome young Bowles, used as an illustration in The Defence of Paris; narrated as it was seen, published in London in 1871, Bowles eyewitness account as a special correspondent for The Morning Post.  (Incidentally, this book is a great read, as Bowles was terribly witty and writes with a startlingly unperturbed and ironic tone. ) For additional information on the relationship between Tissot and Bowles, see my posts: 1869: Tissot meets \"the irresistible\" Tommy Bowles, founder of British Vanity Fair James Tissot & Tommy Bowles Brave the Siege Together: October 1870 Tissots graphite drawing, A Cantiniere of the National Guard (1870-71), is much more interesting than the engraving of it used as an illustration in Bowles book.  A cantiniere, the exhibition text explains, was \"something like a nurse and a sutler (supplier of provisions) accompanying the troops - cantinieres also took up arms on many occasions, playing an increasingly important role in the siege. \" Dont miss Tissots etching of Bowles wife, Portrait of Mrs.  B (1876).  Tommy Bowles was the illegitimate son of Thomas Milner Gibson and a servant, Susannah Bowles.  Jessica Evans-Gordon, daughter of Major-General C.  G.  Evans Gordon, Governor of Netley Hospital, married Bowles in December 1875 and died at 35 in 1887, having borne him four children.  Though Tommy Bowles was quite high-spirited in his youth, he was devoted to the prudent Jessie, so very sober in this image.  After her death, he wrote \"So bright and joyous, so gentle and gracious a spirit as hers. . . still more rarely has been so ordered by a sense of duty.  She was as near perfect wife and mother as may be. \" Then, indulge in the visual feast of some of Tissots best, and most well-known, oil paintings - brimming with his wit, flair, psychological insight and unparalleled ability to capture moments of Victorian life and transport us to his world.  Tissot, 33 when he painted this small picture of the debonair Captain Frederick Gustavus Burnaby (1870).  Tissot owned a villa on the most prestigious avenue in Paris (now avenue Foch), and he occasionally supplied his British friend Tommy Bowles with caricatures of prominent men for Vanity Fair, Tommys new Society magazine which had made its debut in London in 1868.  (The exhibition features Tissots caricature, Napoleon III, Emperor of France, published in Vanity Fair on September 4, 1869. ) One of Tommy Bowles closest friends was the dashing Gus Burnaby (Frederick Gustavus Burnaby, 1842 - 1885), a captain in the privileged Royal Horse Guards, the cavalry regiment that protected the monarch.  Gus, a member of the Prince of Wales set, had suggested the name, Vanity Fair, lent Bowles half of the necessary PS200 in start-up funding, and then volunteered to go to Spain to chronicle his adventures for the satirical magazine.  All Burnabys letters, which were first published on December 19, 1868 and continued through 1869, were titled \"Out of Bounds\" and signed \"Convalescent\" (he suffered intermittent bouts of digestive ailments and depression throughout his life).  Tommy Bowles was 29 when he commissioned Tissot to paint Burnabys portrait.  [To learn about another portrait commission from Bowles to Tissot (not included in the exhibition), see my post: James Tissots \"Miss Sydney Milner-Gibson\" (c.  1872). ] James Tissot fled Paris in June, 1871.  He arrived in London with less than one hundred francs, and with the help of a handful of friends, he proceeded to rebuild his career.  In 1872, Tissot exhibited Les Adieux (The Farewells, 1871) at the Royal Academy.  A sentimental costume piece calculated to appeal to the British public, it is displayed adjacent to J. E.  Millais A Huguenot (1851-52), which it greatly resembles.  [See my post, Was James Tissot a Plagiarist?] Les Adieux was reproduced as a steel engraving by John Ballin and published by Pilgeram and Lefevre in 1873 - an indication of its popularity.  This exhibition is a great opportunity to see this painting.  James Tissot exhibited Too Early at the Royal Academy in 1873, where it was his first big success after moving to London from Paris two years previously.  According to his friend, the painter Louise Jopling (1843 - 1933), Too Early \"made a great sensation. . . It was a new departure in Art, this witty representation of modern life. \" Too Early was purchased by London art dealer William Agnew (1825 - 1910) - who specialized in \"high-class modern paintings\" - and sold in March, 1873 (before its exhibition at the Royal Academy that year) to Charles Gassiot for PS1,155.  Gassiot (1826 - 1902) was a London wine merchant and art patron who, with his wife Georgiana, donated a number of his paintings to the Guildhall Art Gallery, London, including Too Early.  For more on this painting, see my post, A Closer Look at Tissots \"Too Early\".  According to interesting new research by Tissot scholar Krystyna Matyjaszkiewicz, this painting is not a smaller replica of London Visitors in the collection of the Toledo Museum of Art, as formerly believed.  Mrs.  Matyjaszkiewicz has learned from records in the National Gallery Archive that the smaller painting was completed several months before the other.  First called The Portico, the picture in this exhibition was sold by Thomas Agnew & Sons as Country Cousins.  This is a rare opportunity to see London Visitors up close.  The Empress Eugenie and the Prince Imperial in the Grounds at Camden Place, Chislehurst (c.  1874) depicts the exiled French Empress (1826 - 1920), living outside London after the collapse of the Second Empire, and her son, Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte (1856 - 1879), who would be killed at age 23, in the Zulu War.  The only child of Napoleon III of France, he was accepted to the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, in 1872 and is pictured in his uniform as a cadet.  The Empress is in her first year of mourning following the death of her husband in January, 1873, after surgery to remove bladder stones.  Alison McQueen, in Empress Eugenie and the Arts: Politics and Visual Culture in the Nineteenth Century (Routledge, 2017), states that the picture was commissioned by the Empress and adds, \"The wicker chairs and carpet reappear in A Convalescent (c.  1875-76), which further suggests Tissot constructed these scenes in his studio and was not recording mother and son from life studies executed on the property at Camden. \" According to Krystyna Matyjaszkiewicz, who wrote the exhibition catalogue entry, he painted this double portrait of the exiled French royals for the 1875 Royal Academy exhibition, but it was rejected, along with two others (while yet two others, Hush! (The Concert) and The Bunch of Lilacs, were accepted. ) The painting was purchased by Kaye Knowles, Esq.  (1835-1886), a client of London art dealer Algernon Moses Marsden [1848-1920, see Who was Algernon Moses Marsden?].  Knowles, whose vast wealth came from shares in his familys Lancashire coal mining business, owned a large collection of paintings by contemporary artists, including three other oils by Tissot.  James Tissot displayed Hush! (The Concert) at the Royal Academy exhibition in 1875, at the height of his success in London.  It depicts a crowded Kensington salon, said to have been hosted by Lord and Lady Coope, which features a performer believed to be Moravian violinist Wilma Neruda (1838 - 1911).  Though Tissot received an invitation to this soiree, he was not given permission to make portraits of any of the guests.  Acquired by the Manchester Art Gallery in 1933, Hush! is a lovely picture that, on closer inspection, is quite witty.  For more on this painting, see my post, A Closer Look at Tissots \"Hush! (The Concert)\".  By 1873, two years after Tissot arrived in London, he had established himself in a Queen Anne-style villa at 17 (now 44), Grove End Road, St.  Johns Wood.  He designed his garden as a blend of English-style flower beds and plantings familiar to him from French parks.  Gravel paths led to kitchen gardens and greenhouses for flowers, fruit and vegetables.  View of the Garden at 17 Grove End Road (c.  1874-1882) is unusual in that Tissot seldom depicted a landscape that was not a background for figures.  Previously in a private collection, View of the Garden was sold to Agnews at Sothebys, London in 2000 and purchased by the Geffrye in 2004.  Summer (A Portrait), 1876 is radiant and has benefited from recent cleaning.  The womans white muslin gown, with its lemon-yellow stain bows, shimmers, and details such as her ring, and the designs on the blue-green curtains, pull you into the scene.  This painting was exhibited by Tissot at the new Grosvenor Gallery, London, from May to June 1877 as A Portrait.  The Gallery of HMS Calcutta (Portsmouth), c. 1876, by James Tissot.  Oil on canvas, 68. 6 by 91. 8 cm.  Tate.  Though Ive visited the Tate numerous times, this is the first time Ive seen The Gallery of HMS Calcutta in person.  What can I say - its one of Tissots masterpieces, and I was rooted to the spot studying it, as was everyone around me.  You just cannot take your eyes off the gowns, the bows, the faces, the curvaceous wrought-iron railing, the way Tissot painted the caned chairs, the curves of the windows, the rigging of the ships in the distance. . . its an all-you-can-eat buffet for the eyes.  Tissot exhibited it at the Grosvenor Gallery in 1877 to rather cutting reviews.  Go see it while you can, and form your own opinion.  Also in this third gallery are a few etchings and photographs of Kathleen Newton (1854 -1882), Tissots young mistress and muse from about 1876 until her death from tuberculosis six years later.  An idea for a future exhibition would be a display of the numerous images of Mrs.  Newton that Tissot produced, with all known photographs of her and of the two of them together, but this exhibition is not about their relationship.  Keep walking, because in a further gallery showcasing images of \"British Sports, Crowds, and Parks,\" you will find more of Tissots paintings.  In Holyday (c.  1876), Tissot painted members of the famous I Zingari cricket club (which still exists, and is one of the oldest amateur cricket clubs) in their distinctive black, red and gold caps in his garden at 17 Grove End Road, St.  Johns Wood, which was only a few hundred yards from Lords cricket ground.  Holyday was owned by James Taylor, who lent it for exhibition at the Grosvenor Gallery in London from May to June, 1877.  The painting was purchased by the Tate in 1928.  Ive long wanted to see Holyday up close, and I found it so intriguing.  The painting includes a woman Id never noticed in print or digital images - she is indicated only by her white straw bonnet, behind the man leaning against a tree on the far right of the picture.  And the addition of the two other women on the picnic blanket is indicated in the bottom left corner by their skirts, one black-and-white striped, one brown, with the soles of her shoes peeking out behind her knife-pleated hemline.  Theres also a little girl, whom Ive never noticed, sitting at the feet of the old lady in the wicker chair.  This is such a merry picture! It makes you want to join this lively group for a cup of tea and a slice of cake.  The Ball on Shipboard (1874) is a large, dramatic, detailed painting that invites speculation: an enigmatic image as precise as a photograph but which evades precise meaning.  You find yourself transfixed as you try to puzzle it out.  In the center are two women wearing matching blue-and-white yachting gowns.  Scholars have written that Tissot had a fixation with twins, though in the 2013 blockbuster exhibition, \"Impressionism, Fashion, and Modernity\" exhibition curator Gloria Groom of The Art Institute of Chicago asserted that in The Ball on Shipboard, Tissot was satirizing the rise of ready-to-wear fashion (and, of course, the vulgar social climbing efforts of the nouveaux riches).  This is not Tissots only painting of women wearing identical ensembles: see In the Conservatory (1875-76, also known as The Rivals).  In fact, according to my own research, Alexandra, Princess of Wales (1844 - 1925) and her sister, at that time Grand Duchess Maria Feodorovna of Russia.  (1847 -1928, formerly Princess Dagmar of Denmark), were very close and had a habit of wearing identical ensembles when they were together, setting off a general fad for \"double-dressing. \" When the Grand Duchess and her husband the Tsarevich visited London in the summer of 1873, the two sisters wore the same costumes on at least thirteen occasions.  In \"Impressionists in London,\" it is asserted the pair of women in the center of The Ball on Shipboard actually are the Princess of Wales and Maria Feodorovna of Russia, and the occasion an afternoon dance held on the royal naval frigate HMS Ariadne on August 12, 1873, according to research by Krystyna Matyjaszkiewicz.  Im not on board with this theory.  Making royal portraits on, or of, such an occasion would have required that Tissot receive official permission.  This was unlikely, since he was a foreigner and regarded with suspicion for his participation, real or rumored, in the Paris Commune of 1871.  He was not granted permission to make portraits of any of the guests at Lord and Lady Coopes salon for Hush! (The Concert, 1873).  Had he received such permission from the royal family, it would have been common knowledge at the time.  But instead of recognizing this as a royal dance, one reviewer wrote, \"The girls who are spread about in every attitude are evidently the 'high life below stairs of the port, who have borrowed their mistresses dresses for the nonce,\" and another objected to the unseemly amount of cleavage revealed by the women wearing the blue and green day dresses (left of center).  Another critic found in the picture, \"no pretty women, but a set of showy rather than elegant costumes, some few graceful, but more ungraceful attitudes, and not a lady in a score of female figures,\" and another found it \"garish and almost repellent. \" While Tissots contemporaries (but interestingly, not Tissot himself) identified the setting as the yearly regatta at Cowes, on the Isle of Wight, no one at the time considered this a painting of a royal event.  It also makes no sense that Tissot would have made portraits of these two royal women in their matching nautical gowns - and painted the same gown in Reading the News (c.  1874).  It makes more sense that Tissot seized on the concept of a regatta scene while showcasing his skill at painting womens fashions during the craze for double-dressing, also celebrated by the pairs of women in blue and in green in the center background.  If The Ball on Shipboard had featured a double portrait of royalty, it was not purchased by anyone connected to the royal family.  London art dealer William Agnew (1825 - 1910) - who specialized in \"high-class modern paintings\" - purchased The Ball on Shipboard from Tissot that year and sold it to Hilton Philipson (1834 - 1904), a solicitor and colliery owner living at Tynemouth.  It was later owned by equine painter Alfred Munnings (1878 - 1959), who presented it to the Tate in 1937.  Remember to look behind the partition at the back of the room for On the Thames (c.  1876), a masterpiece of texture: wood, wicker, fabric, fur, leather, metal, water, and mist.  Take a long, close look at the picnic hamper.  Tissot displayed this picture as The Thames at the Royal Academy exhibition in 1876, the year he painted it.  It was attacked by reviewers for The Times, the Athenaeum, the Spectator and the Graphic as depicting a subject they considered thoroughly unBritish - prostitution.  What else would the Victorians think of a painting of a rakish officer in a boat with two attractive women and a picnic hamper with three bottles of champagne? The women were perceived as \"undeniably Parisian ladies,\" and the picture itself, \"More French, shall we say, than English?\" This criticism prompted Tissot to paint the more innocent Portsmouth Dockyard (How Happy I Could be with Either!, c.  1877).  A much smaller picture than On the Thames, it is displayed earlier in the exhibition, but I wish the two had been displayed side-by-side.  By this time, you will need to seek seating and sustenance, but your brain will be fully sparked.  The details in all Tissots paintings are extraordinary - really enthralling to observe close-up.  To learn more about a number of the Tissot oils in the show, see my posts: Tissot in the U. K. : London, at the Tate Tissot in the U. K. : London, at The Geffrye & the Guildhall Tissot in the U. K. : Northern England.  There is a great deal more to \"Impressionists in London\" than James Tissot, of course, and more than one visit is necessary to take in works by Monet - including a group of his Houses of Parliament series - Pissarro, Sisley, Alphonse Legros, sculptor Aime-Jules Dalou, Andre Derain, and others.  But if you love Tissots work and want to learn more about him, see this show if you can, and let me know what you think.  \"The EY Exhibition: Impressionists in London, French Artists in Exile (1870 - 1904),\" November 2, 2017 - May 7, 2018.

The group was sometimes collectively known as the Cambridge Mafia. [citation needed] Lamont became chairman of centre-right think tank the Bow Group between 1971 and 1972. Before entering Parliament he worked for N M Rothschild & Sons, the investment bank, and became director of Rothschild Asset Management. Lamont currently, in addition to his role as a working peer, is a director of and a consultant to various companies in the financial sector.  He is a director of the hedge fund company RAB Capital, Balli Group plc (commodities trading house), and he is an advisor to Rotch Property Group.  He is also a director of a number of investment funds. [citation needed] In December 2008 he joined the board of Phorm, an online behaviourial advertising company, and he is a non-executive director of Balli Group PLC and the Honorary President of the British Romanian Chamber of Commerce, and Chairman of the British Iranian Chamber of Commerce. Also, he is on the advisory board of OMFIF where he is regularly involved in meetings regarding the financial and monetary system. Lamont stood as a candidate for Member of Parliament in the June 1970 general election for Kingston upon Hull East.  He was defeated by John Prescott, who went on to become Tony Blair's Deputy Prime Minister.  Two years later, on 4 May 1972, Lamont won a by-election to become MP for Kingston-upon-Thames. Lamont served in successive governments under Margaret Thatcher and John Major for a total of 14 years, in the Departments of Energy, Industry, Defence and the Treasury.  In 1986, he moved to the Treasury, first as Financial Secretary to the Treasury, then Chief Secretary to the Treasury (succeeding John Major in the latter job on Major's promotion to Foreign Secretary in July 1989) under Chancellor Nigel Lawson, whom he tried unsuccessfully to persuade not to resign from the government on the morning of 26 October 1989 - Lawson resigned that evening.  Lamont remained as Chief Secretary to the Treasury under Major's Chancellorship.  In this position he acquiesced in Major's decision to join the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) at a central parity of 2. 95 Deutschmarks to the Pound, although neither he or any other Cabinet ministers were involved or informed about the decision before it had been made. The decision to join the ERM was announced on Friday 5 October 1990, the last trading day before the week of the Conservative party conference.  Shortly afterwards he successfully managed Major's election campaign to succeed Margaret Thatcher as party leader and Prime Minister.  In her memoirs, Thatcher listed Lamont along with six other Cabinet ministers as a potential successor to her. During the leadership election, Lamont clashed angrily in private with Lawson who preferred Michael Heseltine as Thatcher's successor, phoning Lawson up to remind him of his caustic remarks made about Heseltine's economic policies.  Lamont eventually slammed the phone down on Lawson in temper, though he later wrote to Lawson to offer an apology. On 16 May 1991, Lamont stated in parliament that \"Rising unemployment and the recession have been the price that we have had to pay to get inflation down.  That price is well worth paying. \" The remark is regularly, but not always approvingly, recalled by commentators and other politicians.  Seven months before Lamont made the statement, inflation (as measured by the annual change in the Retail Price Index) reached 10. 9%.  In May 1991, inflation fell to 6. 4%.  A year after the Major government was reelected in the 1992 general election, winning the most votes of any political party in British electoral history, inflation fell to 4. 3%, falling to 1. 3% a year later. However the economy continued to contract until the third quarter of 1991.  After economic growth resumed, the economy grew rapidly and by the third quarter of 1993, GDP was greater than the pre-recession peak in the second quarter of 1990. Lamont replaced Major as Chancellor in Major's new Cabinet, thereby inheriting Major's exchange rate policy.  In his memoirs, Lamont recalls a senior Treasury civil servant answering his question on why Britain had joined the ERM as replying, \"It's politics,\" to which Lamont replied, \"I don't think I would have given up the flexibility of the exchange rate. \" In public, Lamont justified the decision to join the ERM in terms of the government's counter-inflation strategy.  In the House of Commons debate shortly after the pound joined the ERM, he argued that under a regime of floating exchange rates, the consequences of depreciating the currency had been short lived in terms of output and competitiveness, \"but have been lasting in terms of inflation.  That is one of the reasons why the Government concluded that it would be right to join the ERM. \" By the time Lamont was appointed Chancellor, the Conservative government's principal economic objective was to regain control of inflation.  The Thatcher government had been elected in 1979 on a manifesto that had listed restoration of sound money as its first priority. Having peaked at 21. 9% in 1980, inflation (as measured by the 12-month increase in the Retail Prices Index) fell to 3. 3% at the beginning of 1988.  However controlling inflation through the targeting of the growth of the domestic money supply, as proposed in that manifesto, turned out to be more problematic than its authors had envisaged and during his time as Chancellor, Lawson had increasingly been drawn instead to targeting the exchange rate to provide an external monetary anchor. From its low point in February 1988, inflation rose with apparent inexorability: of the 31 months until it peaked at 10. 9% in October 1990, there were only four months when inflation fell. In response, interest rates were progressively increased, doubling from 7. 4% in June 1988 to 15% in October 1988, being cut by one point to 14% when the pound entered the ERM, the level of interest rates Lamont inherited as chancellor. As a result, the economy began to slow, contracting by 1. 1% in the third quarter of 1990 and shrinking a further 0. 7% in the final quarter of the year. Thus Lamont's period as Chancellor started with inflation at its highest level since 1982 and the economy in recession.  Asked at his first appearance as chancellor at the Treasury Select Committee whether he agreed with his predecessor's view on the depth and duration of the recession and not wishing to contradict Major, Lamont replied that \"there are reasons why one could believe that it will be relatively short-lived and relatively shallow. \" In October 1991, based on CBI and Institute of Directors business surveys, he said \"what we are seeing is the return of that vital ingredient - confidence.  The Green shoots of economic spring are appearing once again. \" The comment was widely criticised as premature. However, Gavyn Davies, then chief economist at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a newspaper article at the time of Lamont's removal from the Treasury that the \"Green shoots\" speech had turned out to be \"remarkably prescient.  From that moment onwards, output stopped declining, and within a few months, it started to rise. Estimates of Gross Domestic Product show the trough of the recession occurring in the fourth quarter of 1991, with sustained growth resuming in the third quarter of 1992, when GDP grew 0. 4% compared to the second quarter. On succeeding Thatcher, the Major government had to decide its position on the negotiations on European Economic and monetary union (EMU) which would lead to the Maastricht Treaty.  It had been Thatcher's opposition to EMU which triggered the end of her premiership.  Like Thatcher, Lamont was a long-standing opponent of EMU and the European single currency.  In his memoirs, Lamont wrote that he was \"horrified\" when Ted Heath in 1972 announced Britain that it was accepting the Werner Plan for monetary union. Newly appointed as Chancellor, Lamont therefore supported Major's idea of Britain negotiating an opt-out from the single currency.  Negotiations on the economic aspects of the proposed treaty began in earnest at the end of 1990 with monthly meetings of European finance ministers.  At an Intergovernmental Conference held in Rome on 15 December 1990, Lamont declared, \"I remain unconvinced that the potential benefits of a single currency are as great as its supporters allege. \" In a minute to the Cabinet's Defence and Overseas Policy committee the following month, Lamont set out his three objectives for the negotiations: first, to ensure that Britain did not have to join the single currency; second, to ensure the opt-out was legally water-tight; and third, to ensure that during the period in the run-up to the single currency, there should be no binding obligations on Britain. In meeting the third of these, Lamont had to overcome the resistance of the prime minister and the foreign secretary, Douglas Hurd, who told Lamont: \"I can't see what you are so worked up about.  We are in the ERM.  What difference does it make if it is in the Treaty?\" Lamont decided to ignore their objections.  At the next negotiating meeting on the treaty, he told his fellow European finance ministers that Britain would not accept membership of the ERM as a treaty obligation.  As a result, the meeting agreed to remove it. [citation needed] Lamont decided that the best way of securing the first two of his negotiating objectives was for Britain to draw up a protocol listing those parts of the treaty from which Britain would be exempted.  When Wim Kok, the Dutch finance minister chairing the finance ministers' negotiations at Maastricht, decided that the meeting should review the British opt-out line-by-line, Lamont said the text was not negotiable.  After Kok persevered, Lamont walked out of the meeting.  In his absence, the protocol was endorsed without amendment. Within the constraints of the ERM, sterling interest rates were cut seven times in 1991, falling from 14% to 10. 5% in September, with inflation halving from 9. 0% to 4. 5% over the course of the year, leaving real interest rates just 0. 5% lower. The scope for swifter cuts in interest rates was squeezed by an event that few had anticipated when Britain joined the ERM: based on OECD indices of consumer prices, inflation in Germany, which had been 2. 7% in 1990, rose to 5. 1% in 1992, whilst in Britain inflation fell from 7. 0% to 4. 3%. In response, the Bundesbank increased its discount rate from 6. 0% in 1990 to 8. 75% in July 1992, creating the conditions for the turbulence the ERM was to experience later that autumn. Because of rising German rates, Lamont was only able to cut interest rates by a further 0. 5% to 10% in May 1992, when UK conditions would arguably have warranted deeper cuts. [citation needed] Despite the Conservatives' surprise victory in the April 1992 general election, for these reasons, the ERM policy proved increasingly unsustainable and collapsed on Black Wednesday, when Lamont was forced to withdraw the pound from the ERM despite assuring the public that he would not do so just a week earlier.  He faced fierce criticism at the time for his apparent insouciance in the face of the collapse of the stated central plank of his economic policy.  Later that month, at a press conference in the garden of the British embassy in Washington, DC in response to a question as to why he appeared so cheerful, Lamont commented that it was a beautiful morning, adding, \"My wife said she heard me singing in the bath this morning,\" a response which led to the story that he was singing in the bath with happiness at leaving the ERM. After Major left office and published his memoirs, Lamont publicly denied Major's version of events, claiming that Major had effectively opted out of his responsibilities and left Lamont to carry the can for that day's actions.  On the evening of Black Wednesday and for days after, Major contemplated resigning, drafting a statement to that effect, but wrote Lamont a note instructing him not to resign. Major's verdict on the ERM was that it was the medicine that cured Britain of inflation; \"it hurt but it worked. \" Speaking a few days after Black Wednesday, the Governor of the Bank of England, Robin Leigh-Pemberton, argued that \"the decision to join the ERM two years ago in the circumstances; that, having joined, we were right to endeavour to stick it out; and that, in the circumstances which evolved, we were right to withdraw. \" Lamont's view expressed in his memoirs was more nuanced: without the discipline of the ERM, the Major government would have given up on the fight against inflation before Black Wednesday; ERM membership delivered a sharp break in Britain's inflation performance; the judgment of the markets that the higher rates needed to maintain Britain's membership was undoubtedly correct; \"the ERM was a tool that broke in my hands when it had accomplished all that it could usefully do. \" Sir Alan Budd, the Treasury's Chief Economic Adviser during the period and later appointed by Gordon Brown to the Monetary Policy Committee, in an economic assessment of Britain's membership of the ERM, has written, \"although it was certainly a political disaster, the case can be made that it was an economic triumph and marked the turning point in our macro-economic performance. \" During the autumn of 1992 Lamont became a press target in a string of largely fabricated stories: that he had not paid his hotel bill for \"champagne and large breakfasts\" from the Conservative Party Conference (in fact his bill had been forwarded on for settlement); that he was in arrears on his personal Visa credit card bill (true); that in June 1991 he had used taxpayers' money to handle the fall-out from press stories concerning a sex therapist, who was using a flat he owned (the Treasury contributed PS4,700 of the PS23,000 bill which had been formally approved by the Head of the Civil Service and the Prime Minister; there was never any suggestion that he had ever met her); and that he had called at a newsagent in a seedy area of Paddington late at night to purchase champagne and cheap \"Raffles\" cigarettes.  The last story turned out to have been entirely invented. [citation needed] Post-ERM chancellorship  Following Britain's exit from the ERM, Lamont had two major tasks: to replace the ERM with a new framework for monetary policy, and to address the sharp increase in government borrowing caused by the recession and the rapid fall in inflation.  In a letter to the Chairman of the House of Commons Treasury Select Committee in October 1992, Lamont set out a new basis for the conduct of monetary policy centred on inflation targeting.  He set a target range for inflation excluding mortgage interest rate payments of 1-4%, falling into the lower part of the range by the end of the Parliament.  In assessing progress toward meeting the inflation target, there was a target for the growth of narrow money (M0) and monitoring ranges for the growth of broad money (M4).  Decisions on interest rates would also take account of house and asset price inflation and the exchange rate.  Transparency and market credibility would be enhanced by publication of a monthly monetary assessment and the Bank of England was asked to produce a quarterly inflation report. These innovations marked a decisive break with the past and a necessary step toward central bank independence.  Inflation targeting was the basis on which the Bank of England was made independent by the Blair government in 1997, the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee being made accountable for achieving the government's inflation target. The new framework enabled interest rates to be cut from the 10% that they had been within the ERM to 6% by January 1993. Inflation continued to fall.  In June 1993, the first month after Lamont had left the Treasury, Britain recorded its lowest monthly rate of inflation since February 1964. According to Alan Budd, the Treasury's Chief Economic Adviser during the period, the important step of central bank independence could only have been successful once monetary stability had been achieved; \"In 1997 the Bank of England was not asked to succeed where politicians had failed; it was asked to maintain the rate of inflation, namely 2. 5%, that it inherited. \" In Budd's view, the essential elements of the new framework and its success in achieving low and stable inflation were the establishment of an inflation target and the institution of monthly meetings with the governor of the Bank of England to discuss interest rates.  The new framework, according to Budd, \"worked extraordinarily well. \" \"Credit must be given to those, principally Norman Lamont, who designed and implemented it. \" Lamont's second task was to reduce government borrowing, which was rising sharply because of the twofold impact of the ERM on the public finances.  The loss of output had reduced tax revenues and increased public spending as unemployment rose.  The sharp falls in inflation further reduced tax revenues compared to previous forecasts at the same time as increasing public spending after inflation, because public spending is planned in cash terms which becomes worth more in real terms if inflation falls.  The March 1993 budget forecast a Public Sector Borrowing Requirement for 1993-94 of PS50bn, equivalent to 8% of GDP. In terms of the Public Sector Net Cash Requirement, the definition currently in use to measure the UK government deficit, the actual deficit for 1993-94 of 6. 9% was the highest since 1975-76 at 9. 2% but just over half the 13. 3% deficit projected for 2009-10 in the April 2009 budget. To reduce government borrowing, the March 1993 budget announced a rising wedge of tax increases - PS0. 5bn in the first year, PS6. 7bn in the second, rising to PS10. 3bn in the third, the aim being to give markets confidence that government borrowing was under control without damaging the recovery.  Although the budget provoked a fierce reaction in some parts of the press, its reputation improved with the passage of time.  After the 2009 budget, the Sunday Times editorialised that Lamont's budget had been so badly received that he was out of his job within two months, \"but it fixed the public finances and set up the prosperity of the 1990s and beyond\" and Derek Scott, Tony Blair's economic adviser from 1997 to 2003, wrote that Lamont was \"rightly praised\" for putting in place the post-ERM framework, that stage of Lamont's career being \"due for rerating since, in addition to designing a proper framework for monetary policy (later consolidated by Bank of England independence in 1997), he also took most of the tough decisions on spending and tax to put the public finances on the road to recovery. \" Sir Alan Walters, whose opposition to the ERM as Mrs Thatcher's economic adviser triggered Nigel Lawson's resignation as chancellor, wrote on the buoyant state of the British economy in 2001 that \"all the difficult and correct decisions that produced this happy state of affairs were taken and implemented by Norman Lamont, who thus showed himself, in his Mark 2 post ERM version, to be not only the most effective but also the bravest Chancellor since the War. \" Resignation from the Major Government  During the Newbury by-election in May 1993, Lamont was asked at a press conference whether he most regretted claiming to see \"the green shoots of recovery\" or \"singing in his bath\".  He replied by quoting the Edith Piaf song \"Je ne regrette rien\", a dry response which raised a laugh at the press conference but which played poorly when quoted later on the television that evening and afterwards.  When called to defend him on Newsnight his friend the former Labour MP Woodrow Wyatt caused further merriment by claiming that Lamont could do an excellent impersonation of a Scops-owl (whose cry, Lamont later explained, \"sounds like a tennis ball emitter\"). Three weeks after the government's massive loss in the by-election, on 27 May 1993, Lamont was sacked (technically resigning from the government because he declined a demotion to become Secretary of State for the Environment), throwing (by his own account) Major's letter of regret at his departure unopened into the wastepaper basket, and giving a resignation speech in the House of Commons on 9 June, that made clear his feeling that he had been unfairly treated, saying that the government \"gives the impression of being in office but not in power\"; the then Party Chairman Norman Fowler dismissed the speech as \"dud, nasty, ludicrous and silly\". Major and Lamont agree that Lamont had offered his resignation immediately after Black Wednesday and that Major pressed him to remain in office.  Lamont came to the view that Major had sought his survival in office as a firebreak against the criticism of the ERM policy rebounding on himself. [citation needed] In the following years Lamont became a fierce critic of the Major government.  He is now regarded as a staunch euro-sceptic.  In March 1995 he voted with the Labour party in a vote on Europe, and later that year he authored Sovereign Britain in which he envisaged Britain's withdrawal from the European Union, and was talked of as a potential leadership challenger to John Major; in the event it was John Redwood who challenged for the leadership.  Lamont supported Redwood's campaign, which was managed by David Evans MP.  He is the current vice president of the euro-sceptic Bruges Group. [citation needed] Despite departing under a cloud, Lamont defends his budget record to this day.  The 1991 budget, in which he seized the opportunity presented by Thatcher's resignation to restrict mortgage interest tax relief to the basic rate of income tax and also cut the rate of corporation tax by two percentage points, was greeted by positive coverage in The Economist which dubbed him a Nimble Novice.  In the 1992 budget his proposal to advance to a 20% basic rate of income tax through a combination of a narrow initial band, a cut in tax on deposit interest and curtailment of tax allowances was hailed as an elegant way of combining populism with progressivism, though events were later to lend support to Nigel Lawson's view that this approach was strategically inept.  His final budget in 1993 was more sympathetically received by financial specialists than John Major's 1990 budget or Kenneth Clarke's budget of November 1993.  Lamont attributes the large public sector borrowing requirement (i. e.  fiscal deficit) of these years to the depth of the recession triggered by his inability to cut interest rates sooner within the ERM. [citation needed] The day after his dismissal from the Treasury, Sir Samuel Brittan wrote in the Financial Times that history was likely to record him as one of the better Chancellors, citing his structural reforms of taxation, his determination to give priority to securing and maintaining low inflation and the delayed tax increases in his final budget.  \"He leaves behind an economy with a faster growth rate than that of any other of the main G7 countries and an underlying rate of inflation lower than in most. \" According to Ruth Lea, writing 12 years later on the factors behind the subsequent performance of the British economy, Lamont had introduced path-breaking macro-economic reforms including inflation targeting and the first steps towards an independent Bank of England and had begun a programme of fiscal consolidation, which transformed the public finances.  \"These macro economic reforms, along with the Thatcher economic reforms of the 1980s, effectively transformed the British economy. In the period after his resignation, Lamont became the first leading politician to raise the prospect of Britain withdrawing from the European Union. Shortly before the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, the journalist Matthew d'Ancona wrote that someone must have dared to make the initial leap to retrieve the \"frozen thesis\" from its glacial prison.  \"In the case of Brexit, it was Norman Lamont, the former chancellor of the exchequer, who dragged the idea back from the snowy wastes. \" At a private meeting of the Conservative Philosophy Group in 1994, he argued that withdrawal from the European Union was an option that should be restored to the range of serious possibilities, d'Ancona, who attended the meeting, wrote.  Later that year at the Conservative Party conference in Bournemouth, Lamont addressed a fringe meeting of the Selsdon Group.  \"When we come to examine the advantages of our membership today of the European Union they are remarkably elusive.  As a former Chancellor, I can only say that I cannot pinpoint a single concrete advantage that unambiguously comes to this country because of our membership of the European Union,\" Lamont told the group.  He rejected the argument made by Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, who had claimed that the debate in Europe was turning Britain's way.  \"We deceive the British people and we deceive ourselves if we claim that we are winning the argument in Europe . . .  There is not a shred of evidence at Maastricht or since then that anyone accepts our view of Europe. \" Lamont implicitly challenged the view expressed by John Major, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom: \"It has recently been said that the option of leaving the Community was 'unthinkable. ' I believe that this attitude is rather simplistic. \" He stopped short of arguing Britain should unilaterally withdraw from the European Union \"today,\" but warned: \"the issue may well return to the political agenda. \" Instead, he outlined an alternative to membership of a federal EU.  \"This means looking at all the options ranging from membership of an outer tier to participating solely in the European Economic Area.  One day it may mean contemplating withdrawal. In boundary changes enacted for the 1997 general election Lamont's constituency of Kingston upon Thames was split up.  The northern parts were merged with Richmond and Barnes to form Richmond Park, and the southern parts merged with the larger Surbiton to form Kingston and Surbiton.  Lamont lost the contest for the candidacy for the new seat to the incumbent Surbiton MP Richard Tracey.  He then embarked on a high-profile search for a new constituency and was eventually adopted as the Conservative candidate for the new seat of Harrogate and Knaresborough in Yorkshire.  The move was seen as an attempt to parachute in an outsider, with Lamont seeming like an opportunist next to the Liberal Democrat candidate, Phil Willis, a local teacher and long-time local politician.  When the general election came, his unpopularity, and that of the Conservatives in general, led a massive tactical voting campaign in the constituency and the Liberal Democrats won the seat.  He was not recommended for a peerage in John Major's resignation honours, but the following year William Hague recommended him, and Lamont was made a life peer as Baron Lamont of Lerwick, of Lerwick in the Shetland Islands, on 24 July 1998. In 1998 the former military dictator of Chile, General Augusto Pinochet visited Britain to obtain medical treatment.  This prompted a debate about whether he should be arrested and put on trial over his human rights record.  Lamont joined with Margaret Thatcher in defending Pinochet, calling him a \"good and brave and honourable soldier\". His stance was highly criticised. He attempted to be selected as a candidate for the 1999 European Parliament election, but was unsuccessful. In February 2005, it was reported in The Times that Lamont and John Major had held up the release of papers concerning Black Wednesday under the Freedom of Information Act.  The two wrote to the paper to deny the reports.  Later it emerged that the source of the story had been Damian McBride, then a Treasury civil servant who as a result of this became a special adviser to the then Chancellor, Gordon Brown who in 2009 resigned from a similar position in Number 10 Downing Street following publication of emails indicating a plan to smear leading Conservative politicians. In October 2006, he complained that the new party leader David Cameron (Lamont's political adviser around the time of Black Wednesday) lacked policies. In late 2008, Cameron asked Lamont, together with fellow former chancellors Geoffrey Howe, Nigel Lawson and Kenneth Clarke, to provide him with strategic political and economic advice as Britain's banking and fiscal position worsened. In June 2007, Lamont became Honorary Patron of the Oxford University History Society, one of the university's largest societies,[citation needed] and he was, from 1996 to 2008, chairman of Le Cercle, a secret anti-Communist group which meets bi-annually in Washington, DC. In 2008, he became the President of the Economic Research Council, Britain's oldest economics-based think tank. [citation needed] In February 2015, Lamont resigned as a director of Phorm Corporation Limited, an internet personalisation technology company. Yanis Varoufakis maintained that Lamont provided him with \"counsel\", \"advice\" and was \"a pillar of strength\" while he unsuccessfully negotiated Debt relief with the Troika during his six months as Greek Finance Minister in 2015.", "article_1": "The former chancellor of the exchequer Norman Lamont yesterday became the first foreigner to be awarded the \"Star of Honour and Merit\" by the Augusto Pinochet Foundation in Chile, for \"his extraordinary and valiant attitude in defending Senator Pinochet\".  The former dictator's son, ex-military colleagues and associates gathered in front of television cameras in Santiago to pay homage to Mr Lamont.  The president of the foundation, Hernan Briones, said: \"In the last century the English Conservative party gave to humanity such distin guished people for universal history as Sir Winston Churchill and Lady Margaret Thatcher.  Today we have with us Lord Norman Lamont, the prominent Englishman to whom we owe so much. \" Lord Lamont - who did not flinch as he was repeatedly called Lord Lament by his Spanish-speaking hosts - was presented with a medal on a red ribbon.  \"This visit had been planned for some time.  I am only sad that it coincides with such unfortunate and controversial events,\" he said.  On Friday, a Chilean judge ordered Gen Pinochet to be placed under house arrest after he was indicted for his role in a series of crimes under his 17-year rule, including kidnapping, murder and torture.  Lord Lamont said he could not comment on the judicial case in Chile, \"but I would just like to say the arguments that have gone on in the UK have been arguments about history.  Sometimes people forget that there was a cold war.  \"It is easy and a mistake to judge yesterday by today's climate and today's standards. \" Gen Pinochet was a \"friend and ally\" of Britain who had been badly treated after coming to the UK in good faith, Lord Lamont said. ", "article_2": "Lord Lamont of Lerwick knows a thing or two about double digit inflation.  Speaking at the opening session of OMFIFs Global Wealth Strategy Summit in June, he recalled that when he became chancellor of the exchequer in November 1990, inflation in the UK stood at 10. 6%.  This is just below the 11% level the Bank of England is expecting by October.  A clear difference between 2022 and 1990 is that when Norman Lamont became chancellor, the Bank of Englands base rate was 14%.  Todays rate remains deeply negative in real terms.  Small wonder that Lamont was able to offer no soothing advice on how the challenge of inflation can be addressed without pain.  His prescription for reducing inflation, famously articulated in May 1991, was rising unemployment and a recession.  'It was a rough and harsh way of dealing with inflation, which was similar in its mechanism to what Volcker did in the US in the 1980s, he said.  That may send shivers down the spines of those who remember the sky high federal funds rates of the early 1980s.  'I dont think anybody wants deliberately to engineer a recession, said Lamont.  'But what you cant do is abolish the cycle.  Its difficult if not impossible to stimulate an economy and reduce inflation at the same time.  Its like balancing bubbles on a pin.  Central banks must shoulder much of the responsibility for the monetary policy conundrums they face today.  Lamont acknowledged that much of the UKs inflation has been driven by external forces, but probably not as much as the Banks apologists might claim.  'We must recognise that the core rate of inflation excluding energy costs and food is three times the Bank of Englands inflation target, he said.  This suggests that the Bank has spent too long dozing at the monetary policy wheel.  'I was an advocate last year of putting up rates, said Lamont.  'I think central banks everywhere have been somewhat complacent about this.  It suggests, too, that central banks may have had too much faith in the power of guidance to steer inflation.  Lamont recalled that he introduced inflation targeting some years before the Bank of England was made independent.  'To be honest, I always had my reservations about inflation targeting because of its essentially backward-looking nature, he said.  'One of the add-ons designed to deal with this has been forward guidance and the management of expectations.  I think central banks have almost convinced themselves too much that inflation is a phenomenon merely of expectations and that their words control inflation.  This is what [former Bank of England Governor] Mervyn King has called the Canute theory of monetary policy.  Extending the discussion to the outlook for the global economy, speakers at the summit echoed many of the dispiriting forecasts for the UK, where the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is now expecting zero growth in 2023.  This will make it the slowest growing economy in the G7 next year.  But global growth is expected to be markedly weaker in 2023 in almost all countries, according to the OECD.  Sir Vince Cable, who served as the UKs secretary of state for business, innovation and skills between 2010-15, commented that the worlds largest economic regions are each at different stages of the inflation-interest rate cycle.  Several face the risk of secular stagnation driven by weak private investment.  'Bank lending is not growing in the US in real terms, and its falling in real terms quite strongly in the euro area, particularly in southern Europe, he said.  He added that recessionary pressures across a number of economies will exert pressure on governments to fend off rising unemployment by upping public spending.  This will in turn lead to concerns about rising government debt.  'Japan has shown that you can keep this going more or less indefinitely if you have local lenders, said Cable.  'But countries like the UK have to rely on the kindness of strangers.  There are potentially serious risks if governments take too many liberties with the public debt.  A longer-term threat generated by recent economic and political dislocations may be the accelerated demise of globalisation.  'I detect that in the UK government there is a move away from open markets towards more state intervention in industry, said Lamont.  'There is growing nervousness about globalisation.  People are worried about the security of supply chains and there is more hostility towards foreign takeovers.  Lamont was joined by other speakers in identifying this as a backwards step for the UK economy, arguing that exposure to market forces and stronger international competition is a prerequisite for higher productivity.  This may matter less than some economists believe.  The chairman of OMFIFs advisory council, Lord Meghnad Desai, said that globalisation is only necessary for as long as regional specialisation exists.  'Globalisation is needed only when you have raw materials located in one place and factories in another, he said.  'Increasingly, globalisation may only be economically necessary for passenger travel.  Philip Moore is Contributing Editor at OMFIF. ", "article_3": "Greed and corruption abound in the fictional Roadkill, but British Parliament members have a very real record of getting themselves into hot water.  We turned to modern British history experts Dr.  Laura Beers of American University and the North American Conference on British Studies and Dr.  Catherine Haddon from Londons Institute for Government for a round-up of scandals that rocked recent UK politics--from a swinging sixties affair at the height of the Cold War to a staged death on a Florida beach.  1.  1929-1964: Politician, Commentator, Bounder Robert \"Bob\" Boothby was a Conservative party member as well as a recurring BBC commentator on public affairs.  He entered parliament in 1924, at a time when politicians private lives and private infidelities, however well known within Westminster, almost never made the headlines.  During his more than 30 years in parliament, Boothby had a protracted affair with Dorothy Macmillan, the wife of his Conservative colleague Harold Macmillan, beginning in the 1930s and continuing through Macmillans succession to Prime Minister in 1956.  Boothby also had a gay affair with notorious East End gangster Ronnie Kray, who with his identical twin Reggie, dominated Londons underworld for twenty years.  That illicit relationship was hushed up by the largely pro-Tory tabloid press for years before being inferred by the Daily Mirror in 1964, a year after John Profumo (see below) rose to notoriety.  The revelations sparked an MI-5 investigation but did not derail the career of the now Baron Boothby, who continued to sit in the House of Lords until his death in 1986.  2.  1961-1963: The Profumo Affair If Bob Boothby had entered politics a generation later, he may well have met the same fate as his Tory colleague John Profumo.  Profumo was British Secretary of State for War when he began an affair with 19-year-old model, Christine Keeler.  The two were introduced at an exclusive party at Lord Astors Cliveden estate, adding an extra layer of aristocratic debauchery to the story.  At the time of their relationship, Keeler was also involved with Soviet naval attache and suspected spy, Yevgeny \"Eugene\" Ivanov.  Rumors of the affair and its potential security implications spread rapidly and, unlike Boothbys underworld associations, did not stay quiet.  Profumo denied the affair to the House of Commons.  The police became involved and Keeler testified to the relationship, leading to Profumos resignation on June 5, 1963.  Profumos wife Valerie stood by him, and a \"chastened and redemptive\" Profumo became an anonymous volunteer with the poor.  After his death, declassified M15 documents from the 1930s revealed Profumo had also had an affair with a Nazi spy.  3.  1961-1979: A Very British Scandal The true story of the first British politician to stand trial for conspiracy to murder was featured in the 2018 miniseries starring Hugh Grant and Ben Whishaw.  Jeremy Thorpe was the stylish and charismatic Liberal party leader, desperate to hide a previous affair with Norman Scott, a stable hand he met while visiting a friend in 1961.  When Scott refused to stop contacting Thorpe after the married MP ended their relationship, Thorpe allegedly paid to have his former lover killed.  The October 1975 attempt on Scott failed, though his beloved Great Dane Rinka was shot.  Scott publicly accused Thorpe, who was forced to resign as leader of his party in May 1976.  But the resignation did not end the scandal, which dragged on in the press and ultimately in the courts, with Thorpe becoming the first sitting MP to stand trial for murder in May 1979.  While Thorpe was ultimately acquitted, the scandal ended his political career.  4.  1974: A Faked Death Even among British political scandals the story of John Stonehouse is a standout.  Stonehouse was a former Labour cabinet minister who fell into financial trouble and came under investigation by the Department of Trade and Industry.  Rather than face prosecution, he allegedly deposited his clothes on a beach in Miami, Florida to leave the impression that he had drowned.  As Miami police investigated his apparent demise, Stonehouse and his secretary fled to Australia to start a new life under assumed names.  The pair lasted only a month before being discovered by chance.  They were eventually deported to England where Stonehouse would stand trial in 1976 for fraud, theft and forgery.  Remarkably, Stonehouse refused to relinquish his parliamentary seat after his \"resurrection\" and sat in parliament until conducting his own defense.  He was convicted, served time in prison, and eventually wed his secretary.  5.  1993: \"Back to Basics\" The 1980s lacked the political drama of the preceding decades, but there was nonetheless a sense within the Conservative Party that the Tories needed to change their image.  While many admired Margaret Thatcher as the \"Iron Lady,\" others saw the Tories as the \"nasty party. \" When John Major took over for Thatcher in 1990, he set out to change the partys image.  In a 1993 speech, he famously declared that the country should go 'back to basics, returning to core values of \"neighbourliness, decency, courtesy\".  The slogan came to be a source of ridicule for the government over the next few years as ministers were caught in a quick succession of sex and money scandals that harkened back to those of the 1960s and 1970s.  Chancellor Norman Lamont was revealed to have a sex therapist living in his rented-out London flat.  David Mellor resigned as a minister after sordid revelations of an extra-marital affair with actress Antonia de Sancha.  Transport minister Steven Norris was reportedly having simultaneous affairs with three women who did not know about each other.  Conservative MP Stephen Milligan was tragically found dead on his kitchen table as a result of auto-erotic asphyxiation.  Major himself denied an affair with Downing Street caterer Clare Latimer.  Years later, it was revealed hed had a four-year affair with fellow conservative MP Edwina Currie.  (Their relationship is assumed to have provided fodder for Curries political novels, including A Parliamentary Affair. ) In addition to press revelations of sexual improprieties, The Guardian brought the financial misconduct of certain ministers to light.  The newspaper accused two MPs of being paid thousands of pounds to ask questions in Parliament on behalf of Harrods owner Mohammed Al-Fayed: Tim Smith resigned as Northern Ireland minister and later admitted to accepting the money; Conservative MP Neil Hamilton lost his libel suit against Al-Fayed when the court was satisfied the Harrods owner had, indeed, made his case.  The Guardian and ITVs investigative series both alleged that Conservative Cabinet minister Jonathan Aitken had improper commercial relations with Saudi businessmen.  Aitken sued the news outlets but was later jailed for perjury after lying under oath.  A far cry from the \"decency\" which Major had promised the British people! 6.  1998-2010: Third Times a Charm \"Decency\" is a word few have ever associated with Tony Blairs longtime confident and New Labour mastermind Peter Mandelson, the political Svengali who orchestrated the 1997 election campaign resulting in Labours landslide victory.  Blair rewarded Mandelson by making him a Minister with Portfolio, or senior cabinet advisor, before moving him to the Department for Trade and Industry.  \"Mandy\" was forced to resign this post after only five months when he was discovered to have accepted (and failed to declare) an Interest-free loan from a fellow ministerial colleague.  He was back in government less than a year later, however, when Blair appointed him Minister for Northern Ireland.  This time he lasted a year before being accused of inappropriately helping an Indian billionaire secure a British passport and resigned again In 2001.  In 2004, Peter Mandelson left parliament for the European Commission, where he served four years as a trade commissioner.  Blair brought him back to Westminster in 2008 and Mandelson was appointed to the House of Lords, returning to government for a third time as Business Secretary.  This time, he survived the post until the government lost office in the 2010 election. ", "article_4": "Thanks for visiting Lamontations!

Before becoming an author, Archer was a Member of Parliament (1969-1974), but did not seek re-election after a financial scandal that left him almost bankrupt. Archer revived his fortunes as a novelist.  His 1979 novel Kane and Abel remains one of the best-selling books in the world, with an estimated 34 million copies sold worldwide. Overall his books have sold more than 320 million copies worldwide. Archer became deputy chairman of the Conservative Party (1985-86), before resigning after a newspaper accused him of paying money to a prostitute.  In 1987, he won a court case and was awarded large damages because of this claim. He was made a life peer in 1992 and subsequently became Conservative candidate to be the first elected Mayor of London.  He resigned his candidacy in 1999 after it emerged that he had lied in his 1987 libel case.  He was imprisoned (2001-2003) for perjury and perverting the course of justice, ending his active political career. Jeffrey Howard Archer was born in the City of London Maternity Hospital in Holloway, London on 15 April 1940. He was two weeks old when his family moved to Somerset, eventually settling in the seaside town of Weston-super-Mare, where Archer spent most of his early life. His father, William (died 1956), was 64 years old when Jeffrey Archer was born.  Early in his career, Archer gave conflicting accounts to the press of his father's supposed, but non-existent, military career. William Archer was, in fact, a bigamist, fraudster, and conman, who impersonated another William Archer, a deceased war medal holder.  He was at different times employed as a chewing gum salesman in New York and a mortgage broker in London.  In the latter capacity, he was charged at the Old Bailey with a series of fraud offences.  On being released on bail, he absconded to the US under the name William Grimwood.  In the US, William Archer fathered a child, Rosemary Turner (21 June 1917 - 11 October 1986), Jeffrey's half-sister.  In 1940 Rosemary married lawyer Brien McMahon who went on to become the Democratic senator for Connecticut (1945-1952) and a contender for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1952.  After Brien McMahon's death that year, Rosemary married, in 1953, the Belgian ambassador to Washington, Baron Silvercruys.  The First Lady, Mamie Eisenhower, was the guest-of-honour at their wedding. As a boy Archer dreamt of being captain of the Bristol Rovers Football Club.  He is still a fan of the club. In 1951, Archer won a scholarship to Wellington School in Somerset, not Wellington College in Berkshire, as he was later inclined to claim after passing the 11-plus. At this time his mother, Lola, was employed as a journalist on Weston's local newspaper, the Weston Mercury. She wrote a weekly column entitled \"Over the Teacups\", and frequently wrote about Jeffrey, calling him 'Tuppence'. Although Archer enjoyed the local fame this brought him, it caused him to be the victim of bullying while at Wellington School. Archer left school with O-levels in English literature, art, and history.  He then spent a few years in a variety of jobs, including training with the army and a short period with the Metropolitan Police. He later worked as a physical education teacher, first at Vicar's Hill, a preparatory school in Hampshire, and later at Dover College in Kent. In 1963 Archer was offered a place at the Oxford University Department for Continuing Education to study for a Diploma of Education.  The course was based in the department, and Archer became a member of Brasenose College.  There have been claims that Archer provided false evidence of his academic qualifications to Brasenose, the apparent citing of an American institution which was actually a bodybuilding club, for instance, in gaining admission to the course. It has also been alleged Archer provided false statements about three non-existent A-level passes and a U. S.  university degree. Although the diploma course only lasted a year, Archer spent a total of three years at Oxford. At Oxford, Archer was successful in athletics, competing in sprinting and hurdling, and became president of the Oxford University Athletic Club. Television coverage survives of him making false starts in a 1964 sprint race, but he was not disqualified.  He gained a blue in athletics and went on to run for England, and once competed for Great Britain. Archer raised money for the charity Oxfam, obtaining the support of The Beatles in a fundraising drive.  The band accepted his invitation to visit the Principal's lodge at Brasenose College, where they were photographed with Archer and dons of the college, although they did not play there.  The critic Sheridan Morley, then a student at Merton, was present and recalled the occasion: At the interval I went to the toilet, and there beside me was Ringo Starr.  He asked if I knew this Jeffrey Archer bloke.  I said everyone in Oxford was trying to work out who he was.  Ringo said: 'He strikes me as a nice enough fella, but he's the kind of bloke who would bottle your piss and sell it. After leaving Oxford, Archer continued as a charity fundraiser, initially working for the National Birthday Trust, a medical charity that promoted safe childbirth, before joining the United Nations Association (UNA) as its chief fundraiser.  The then chairman of the UNA, Humphry Berkeley, alleged that there were numerous discrepancies in Archer's expense claims whilst he worked at the UNA. Around this time, Archer began a career in politics, serving as a Conservative councillor on the Greater London Council (1967-1970). Archer set up his own fundraising and public relations company, Arrow Enterprises, in 1969. That same year he opened an art gallery, the Archer Gallery, in Mayfair.  The gallery specialised in modern art, including pieces by the sculptor and painter Leon Underwood.  The gallery ultimately lost money, however, and Archer sold it two years later. At 29, Archer was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for the Lincolnshire constituency of Louth, holding the seat for the Conservative Party in a by-election on 4 December 1969. Archer beat Ian Gow to the selection after winning over a substantial proportion of younger members at the selection meeting.  The national party had concerns about Archer's selection, specifically relating to the UNA expenses allegations made by Humphry Berkeley, himself a former Conservative MP.  Berkeley tried to persuade the Conservative Central Office that Archer was unsuitable as a parliamentary candidate. Archer brought a defamation action against Berkeley and the story was kept out of the press, although a truncated version of the story did appear in The Times. The case was eventually settled out of court, with Archer agreeing to pay legal costs of around PS30,000. Louth constituency had three key areas: Louth, Cleethorpes, and Immingham.  During his time as an MP, Archer was a regular at the Immingham Conservative Club in the most working-class part of the constituency.  In 1970 he took part in the Kennedy Memorial Test, a 50-mile running/walking race from Louth to Skegness and back. In parliament, Archer was on the left of the Conservative Party, rebelling against some of his party's policies.  He advocated free TV licences for elderly people and was against museum entrance charges. In 1971, he employed David Mellor to deal with his correspondence.  He tipped Mellor to reach the cabinet.  In an interview, in February 1999 Archer said, \"I hope we don't return to extremes.  I'm what you might call centre-right but I've always disliked the right wing as much as I've disliked the left wing. In 1974, Archer was a casualty of a fraudulent investment scheme involving a Canadian company called Aquablast.  The debacle lost him his first fortune and left him almost PS500,000 in debt. Fearing imminent bankruptcy, he stood down as an MP at the October 1974 general election.  While he was a witness in the Aquablast case in Toronto in 1975, Archer was accused of stealing three suits from a department store. Archer denied the accusation for many years, but in the late 1990s he finally acknowledged that he had taken the suits, although he claimed that at the time he had not realised he had left the shop. No charges were ever brought. Archer wrote his first book, Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less, in the autumn of 1974, as a means of avoiding bankruptcy. The book was picked up by the literary agent Deborah Owen and published first in the U. S. , then eventually in Britain in the autumn of 1976.  A radio adaptation was aired on BBC Radio 4 in the early 1980s and a BBC Television adaptation of the book was broadcast in 1990. Kane and Abel (1979) proved to be his best-selling work, reaching number one on The New York Times bestsellers list.  Like most of his early work, it was edited by Richard Cohen, the Olympic fencing gold-medallist. It was made into a television mini-series by CBS in 1985, starring Peter Strauss and Sam Neill.  The following year, Granada TV screened a 10-part adaptation of another Archer bestseller, First Among Equals, which told the story of four men and their quest to become prime minister.  In the U. S.  edition of the novel, the character of Andrew Fraser was eliminated, reducing the number of protagonists to three. As well as novels and short stories, Archer has also written three stage plays.  The first, Beyond Reasonable Doubt, opened in 1987 and ran at the Queen's Theatre in London's West End for over a year. Archer's next play, Exclusive, opened at the Strand Theatre, London, in September 1989. It was not well received by critics, and closed after a few weeks.  His final play, The Accused, opened at the Theatre Royal, Windsor on 26 September 2000, before transferring to the Theatre Royal, Haymarket in the West End in December. In 1988, author Kathleen Burnett accused Archer of plagiarising a story she had written, and including it in his short-story collection, A Twist in the Tale.  Archer denied he had plagiarised the story, claiming he had simply been inspired by the idea. Whilst Archer's books are commercially successful, critics have been generally unfavourable towards his writing. Journalist Hugo Barnacle, writing for The Independent about The Fourth Estate (1996), thought the novel, while demonstrating that \"the editors don't seem to have done any work\", was \"not wholly unsatisfactory\". Archer has said that he spends considerable time writing and re-writing each book.  He goes abroad to write the first draft, working in blocks of two hours at a time, then writes anything up to 17 drafts in total. Since 2010, Archer has written the first draft of each new book at his villa in Majorca, called \"Writer's Block\". In 2011, Archer published the first of seven books in The Clifton Chronicles series, which follow the life of Harry Clifton from his birth in 1920, through to his funeral in 1993.  The first novel in the series, Only Time Will Tell, tells the story of Harry from 1920 through to 1940, and was published in the UK on 12 May 2011. The seventh and final novel in the series, This Was a Man, was published on 3 November 2016. The Short, the Long and the Tall, an illustrated collection of Archer's short stories, was published in November 2020, with watercolour illustrations by artist Paul Cox. Over My Dead Body was published in October 2021, and is the fourth book in a series featuring detective William Warwick. In January 2020 it was reported that Archer had sued his former literary agents, Curtis Brown, for PS500,000 in unpaid royalties. Deputy party chairman  Archer's political career revived in the 1980s, and he became a popular speaker among the Conservative grassroots.  He was appointed deputy chairman of the Conservative Party by Margaret Thatcher in September 1985.  Norman Tebbit, party chairman, had misgivings over the appointment, as did other prominent members of the party, including William Whitelaw and Ted Heath. During his tenure as deputy chairman, Archer was responsible for a number of embarrassing moments, including his statement, made during a live radio interview, that many young, unemployed people were simply unwilling to find work. At the time of Archer's comment, unemployment in the UK stood at a record 3. 4 million.  Archer was later forced to apologise for the remark, saying that his words had been \"taken out of context\".  Archer resigned as deputy chairman in October 1986 due to a scandal caused by an article in The News of the World, which led with the story, \"Tory boss Archer pays vice-girl\", and claimed Archer had paid Monica Coghlan, a prostitute, PS2,000 through an intermediary at Victoria Station to go abroad. Shortly after The News of the World story broke, rival tabloid the Daily Star ran a story alleging Archer had paid for sex with Coghlan, something The News of the World had been careful to avoid stating directly. Archer responded by suing the Daily Star. The case came to court in July 1987.  Explaining the payment to Coghlan as the action of a philanthropist rather than that of a guilty man, Archer won the case and was awarded PS500,000 damages. Archer stated he would donate the money to charity. However, this case would ultimately result in Archer's final exit from front-line politics some years later.  The description the judge (Mr Justice Caulfield) gave of Mrs Archer in his jury instructions included: \"Remember Mary Archer in the witness-box.  Your vision of her probably will never disappear.  Has she elegance? Has she fragrance? Would she have, without the strain of this trial, radiance? How would she appeal? Has she had a happy married life? Has she been able to enjoy, rather than endure, her husband Jeffrey?\" The judge then went on to say of Jeffrey Archer: \"Is he in need of cold, unloving, rubber-insulated sex in a seedy hotel round about quarter to one on a Tuesday morning after an evening at the Caprice?\" Although the Archers claimed they were a normal, happily-married couple, by this time, according to the journalist Adam Raphael, Jeffrey and Mary Archer were living largely separate lives.  The editor of the Daily Star, Lloyd Turner, was sacked six weeks after the trial by the paper's owner Lord Stevens of Ludgate. Adam Raphael soon afterwards found proof that Archer had perjured himself at the trial, but his superiors were unwilling to take the risk of a potentially costly libel case. The News of the World later settled out-of-court with Archer, acknowledging they, too, had libelled him. When Saddam Hussein suppressed Kurdish uprisings in 1991, Archer, with the Red Cross, set up the charity Simple Truth, a fundraising campaign on behalf of the Kurds. In May 1991, Archer organised a charity pop concert, starring Rod Stewart, Paul Simon, Sting and Gloria Estefan, who all performed free of charge.  Archer stated that his charity had raised PS57,042,000, though it was later reported that only PS3 million came from the Simple Truth concert and appeal, the rest from aid projects sponsored by the British and other governments, with significant amounts pledged before the concert. The charity would later incur further controversy.  Having been previously rejected, Archer was made a life peer on 27 July 1992 as Baron Archer of Weston-super-Mare, of Mark in the County of Somerset. Prime Minister John Major recommended him largely because of Archer's role in aid to the Kurds. Archer and Major had been friends for a number of years. In a speech at the 1993 Conservative conference, Archer urged then Home Secretary Michael Howard, to \"Stand and deliver,\" saying: \"Michael, I am sick and tired of being told by old people that they are frightened to open the door, they're frightened to go out at night, frightened to use the parks and byways where their parents and grandparents walked with freedom . . .  We say to you: stand and deliver!\".  He then attacked violent films and urged tougher prison conditions to prevent criminals from re-offending.  He criticised the role of \"do-gooders\" and finished off the speech by denouncing the opposition party's law and order policies. This was a time when Archer was actively seeking another front-line political role. On Question Time on 20 January 1994, Archer said that 18 should be the age of consent for gay sex, as opposed to 21, which it was at the time. Archer though was opposed to the age of consent for gay men being 16. Historian David Starkey was on the same edition, and said of Archer: \"Englishmen like you enjoy sitting on the fence so much because you enjoy the sensation. \" Archer has also consistently been an opponent of a return to capital punishment. In January 1994, Mary Archer, then a director of Anglia Television, attended a directors' meeting at which an impending takeover of Anglia Television by MAI, which owned Meridian Broadcasting, was discussed.  The following day, Jeffrey Archer bought 50,000 shares in Anglia Television, acting on behalf of a friend, Broosk Saib.  Shortly after this, it was announced publicly that Anglia Television would be taken over by MAI.  As a result, the shares jumped in value, whereupon Archer sold them on behalf of his friend for a profit of PS77,219. The arrangements he made with the stockbrokers meant he did not have to pay at the time of buying the shares. An inquiry was launched by the Stock Exchange into possible insider trading.  The Department of Trade and Industry, headed by Michael Heseltine, announced that Archer would not be prosecuted due to insufficient evidence.  His solicitors admitted that he had made a mistake, but Archer later said that he had been exonerated. In 1999, Archer had been selected by the Conservative Party as candidate for the London mayoral election of 2000, with the support of two former Prime Ministers, Baroness Thatcher and John Major. On 21 November 1999 the News of the World published allegations made by Ted Francis, a former friend, that Archer had committed perjury in his 1987 libel case.  Archer withdrew his candidature the following day. After the allegations broke, Archer was disowned by his party.  Conservative leader William Hague explained: \"This is the end of politics for Jeffrey Archer.  I will not tolerate such behaviour in my party. \" On 4 February 2000, Archer was expelled from the party for five years. Trial  On 26 September 2000, Archer was charged with perjury and perverting the course of justice during the 1987 libel trial. Ted Francis was charged with perverting the course of justice. Simultaneously, Archer starred in a production of his own courtroom play The Accused, staged at London's Theatre Royal Haymarket.  The play concerned the court trial of an alleged murderer and assigned the role of jury to the audience, which would vote on the guilt of Archer's character at the end of each performance. The perjury trial began on 30 May 2001, a month after Monica Coghlan's death in a road traffic collision. Ted Francis claimed that Archer had asked him to provide a false alibi for the night Archer was alleged to have been with Monica Coghlan. Angela Peppiatt, Archer's former personal assistant, also claimed Archer had fabricated an alibi in the 1987 trial.  Peppiatt had kept a diary of Archer's movements, which contradicted evidence given during the 1987 trial. Andrina Colquhoun, Archer's former mistress, confirmed that they had been having an affair in the 1980s, thus contradicting the claim that he and Mary Archer had been \"happily married\" at the time of the trial. Archer never spoke during the trial, though his wife Mary again gave evidence as she had done during the 1987 trial. On 19 July 2001, Archer was found guilty of perjury and perverting the course of justice at the 1987 trial.  He was sentenced to four years' imprisonment by Mr Justice Potts. Francis was found not guilty.  Prominent journalists admitted to having accepted Archer's hospitality after he was convicted. Archer's mother had died shortly before he was sentenced and he was released for the day to attend her funeral. Archer was initially sent to HM Prison Belmarsh, a Category \"A\" prison, but was moved to HM Prison Wayland, a Category \"C\" prison in Norfolk, on 9 August 2001.  Despite automatically qualifying as a category \"D\" prisoner given it was a first conviction and he did not pose a serious risk of harm to the public, his status as such was suspended pending a police investigation into allegations about his Kurdish charity.  He was then transferred to HM Prison North Sea Camp, an open prison, in October 2001.  From there he was let out to work, briefly, at the Theatre Royal in Lincoln, and allowed occasional home visits. Media reports claimed he had abused this privilege by attending a lunch with a friend, Education Secretary Gillian Shephard. In September 2002 he was transferred to a Category \"B\" prison, Lincoln. After three weeks, he was moved to the Category \"D\" HM Prison Hollesley Bay in Suffolk. During his imprisonment, Archer was visited by a number of high-profile friends, including actor Donald Sinden and entertainer Barry Humphries (who performs as Dame Edna Everage). In October 2002, Archer repaid the Daily Star the PS500,000 damages he had received in 1987, as well as legal costs and interest of PS1. 3 million. That month, he was suspended from Marylebone Cricket Club for seven years. On 21 July 2003, Archer was released on licence from Hollesley Bay after serving half of his sentence. He remained a peer, there being no legal provision through which his peerage could be removed at the time other than passing a new Act of Parliament. He also retained membership of the House of Lords, which did not then have the power to expel members; however, Archer has not taken an active part in the proceedings of the House.  Politically, he is a non-affiliated member. While in prison, Archer wrote the three-volume memoir A Prison Diary, with volumes fashioned after Dante's Divine Comedy, and named after the first three prisons in which he was kept. His prison term also served as inspiration for nine of the 12 short stories in the collection Cat O' Nine Tales. In July 2001, shortly after Archer was jailed for perjury, Scotland Yard began investigating allegations that millions of pounds had disappeared from his Kurdish charity. In 1991, Archer had claimed to have raised PS57,042,000. In 1992, the Kurdish Disaster Fund wrote to Archer, complaining: \"You must be concerned that the Kurdish refugees have seen hardly any of the huge sums raised in the west in their name. \" Kurdish groups claimed that little more than PS250,000 had been received by groups in Iraq. A British Red Cross-commissioned KPMG audit of the cash showed no donations were handled by Archer and any misappropriation was \"unlikely\"; however, KPMG also could find no evidence to support Archer's claims to have raised PS31. 5 million from overseas governments.  The police said they would launch a \"preliminary assessment of the facts\" from the audit but were not investigating the Simple Truth fund. In 2004, the government of Equatorial Guinea alleged that Archer was one of the financiers of the failed 2004 coup d'etat attempt against it, citing bank details and telephone records as evidence. In 2009, Archer said: \"I am completely relaxed about it.  Mr Mann [Simon Mann, the English mercenary leader of the coup] has made clear that it's nothing to do with me. \" In 2011, Mann, imprisoned in Equatorial Guinea for his role in leading the failed 2004 coup d'etat but released on humanitarian grounds later, told The Daily Telegraph that his forthcoming book, Cry Havoc, would reveal \"the financial involvement of a controversial and internationally famous member of the British House of Lords in the plot, backed up by banking records. \" He claimed documents from the bank accounts in Guernsey of two companies Mann used as vehicles for organising the coup, showed a 'J H Archer' paying $135,000 into one of the firms. Archer has been married to Mary Weeden since July 1966. They met at Oxford University, where Weeden was studying chemistry at St Anne's College. She went on to specialise in solar power. They have two children: William Archer (born 1972), a theatrical producer, and James Archer (born 1974), a financial adviser and businessman.  In 1979, the Archers purchased the Old Vicarage, Grantchester, a house associated with the poet Rupert Brooke.  Every summer, they host a lavish garden party in the grounds to celebrate their wedding anniversary. By the early 1980s, Archer was back in a comfortable financial position and began to hold shepherd's pie and Krug parties for prominent people at his London penthouse, which overlooks the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament. On 26 February 2006, on Andrew Marr's Sunday AM programme, Archer said he had no interest in returning to front-line politics and would pursue his writing instead. Archer was satirically portrayed as a misunderstood secret agent, saviour of Britain and mankind and \"overall thoroughly good chap\", by actor Damian Lewis in the BBC drama Jeffrey Archer: The Truth (2002). Scriptwriter Guy Jenkin explained that \"my Jeffrey Archer is the man who has frequently saved Britain over the last 30 years.  He's beloved of all women he comes across, all men, all dogs--he's a superhero. \" Ian Hislop and Nick Newman's 1994 BBC Radio 4 satirical series Gush purported to be \"written by master storyteller Archie Jeffries\". In the Amazon series Good Omens, a reference is made by one of the angels in Aziraphale's bookshop: \"Something smells evil. \" Aziraphale replies, \"Oh, that would be the Jeffrey Archer books, I'm afraid. \" In the Doctor Who episode Silence in the Library, the Doctor mentions that the Library has whole continents of Jeffery Archer. Archer has published 42 works, which have been translated into 33 languages, with combined sales of more than 275 million copies.

His father, William, is much older than his mother but not, as Archer sometimes intimated, a decorated first world war hero.  He was a convicted fraudster and bigamist who travelled to the United States on his dead employer's passport.  He lived out the war years duping, in the words of a 1919 newspaper article, \"many well known New York people\".  September 1951: Archer attends Wellington School in Somerset.  It was a private school but not - as some may have mistakenly believed - the much more exclusive Wellington college in Berkshire.  If you can't remember the 60s October 1963: Archer claims to have been a student at Oxford university (in Who's Who he still lists Brasenose college as his alma mater).  But according to his unauthorised biographer, Michael Crick, he was actually at the less exclusive Oxford department of education.  It is also alleged he gave false academic qualifications to get on the course, including three non-existent A-levels and a two-year US degree.  May 1964: Archer wins an Oxford blue running for the university athletics club.  Some ask whether he is eligible to take part in Varsity matches but he goes on to have an impressive career in running and is, briefly, selected to represent England and Great Britain.  July 1966: Archer marries Mary Weeden at the university church, St Mary-the-Virgin.  She describes herself in the marriage certificate as a \"research graduate\".  Her husband claims to be one too, which he is not.  Politics (part one) - a rise and a fall April 1967: Enters politics with a seat on Greater London council.  December 1969: Wins a by-election for the Tories in Louth, Lincolnshire, and, at 29 years old, becomes Britain's fourth youngest MP (not the youngest as it was later claimed).  1974: Resigns from parliament when he is declared bankrupt after Aquablast, a fraudulent Canadian cleaning firm in which he had invested his life savings, goes bust.  In Toronto to give evidence relating to the Aquablast case, Archer is detained on suspicion of shoplifting, though no charges are brought.  A man of letters April 1976: Archer re-enters public life with the publication of Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less.  The book is not appreciated by the critics, but sells well, as do his other novels.  He goes on to make a fortune with other titles such as Kane and Abel and the Prodigal Daughter.  Politics (part two) September 1985: Appointed deputy chairman of the Conservative party.  Lord Whitelaw warned the then prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, that he was \"an accident waiting to happen\".

The judge, Mr Justice Caulfield, famously questions in his summing up why a man with such a \"fragrant\" wife would pay for sex.  Archer is awarded PS500,000 in damages.  Full story June 1992: Receives a peerage from John Major in recognition of his fundraising work for displaced Kurds.  His title: Lord Archer of Weston-super-Mare.  Full story January 1994: Turns a PS78,000 profit, on behalf of a friend, on Anglia TV shares during takeover negotiations.  His wife is a member of the board, but following an investigation by the department of trade and industry no charge of insider dealing ensued.  Full story Politics (part three) May 1997: Archer expresses an interest in becoming London mayor, a post to be created by the newly-elected Labour government.  After two years' canvassing the electorate and studying the role of big city mayors worldwide, he believed the ups and downs of his life would endear him to the people.  \"When I go round the streets at night talking to people in doorways, they treat me as an equal,\" he told one interviewer.  \"They all say 'Jeffrey was in terrific debt, he's had his problems, he'll understand'. \" Less supportive were Lee Jasper, now a member of the mayor's advisory cabinet, and Trevor Philips, a potential Labour candidate - neither took kindly to his description of black women in the 1950s as \"badly dressed [and] probably overweight\".

The Tory leader, William Hague, who previously described Archer as a candidate of \"probity and integrity\", now tells him he has \"let the party down\".  Only months earlier, Archer had assured the party chairman, Michael Ancram, that there were no more damaging allegations about him which could resurface.  He is suspended from the Tory party for five years and a perjury investigation begins.

In a break from dramatic convention, the audience becomes a jury and uses electronic keypads to pass judgement on the man in the dock.  Most attention, however, derives from events in the hours before the curtain rises: Archer is committed to stand trial and charged with five counts including perjury and perverting the course of justice.

He was born in London, and brought up in the West Country.  He gained a Blue in Athletics at Oxford, was President of the University Athletics Club, and went on to run the 100 yards in 9. 6 seconds for Great Britain in 1966.  Jeffrey has served five years in the House of Commons as a Member of Parliament, and thirty years as a Member of the House of Lords.  He has written 27 novels, 7 sets of short stories, 3 prison diaries, 3 plays (all of which have been performed in London's West End) and a gospel.  His first novel, Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less was sold to 17 countries within a year.  It was also made into a successful serial for BBC Radio 4, and was later televised in 1990 by the BBC.  He won the Prix Relay du Roman dEvasion, a prize that rewards a novel in which readers can 'escape from everyday life, for his novel Paths of Glory, and the Prix Polar International Prize for the best international thriller of the year, for his novel A Prisoner of Birth.  The Clifton Chronicles, a series of seven novels published between 2011-2017, topped the bestseller lists around the world.  Famous for his discipline as a writer who works on up to fourteen drafts of each book, Jeffrey also brings a vast amount of insider knowledge to his books.  Whether its his own career in politics, his passionate interest in art, or the wealth of fascinating background detail - inspired by the extraordinary network of friends he has built over a lifetime at the heart of Britains establishment - his novels provide a fascinating glimpse into a range of closed worlds.  Jeffrey is also an amateur auctioneer, conducting up to 20 charity auctions a year.  He has been married to Dame Mary Archer, Chair of the Science Museum Group, for 55 year, and they have two sons, two granddaughters and three grandsons.

''No one should have any sympathy for Jeffrey Archer,'' said the editor, Peter Hill.  ''He is a proven liar, a cheat and a chancer, a man so arrogant that he thought he was above the law.  Now he has gotten what he deserves. '' Lord Archer-super-Mare, as he is known formally, has been the subject of fiercely denied accusations over the years ranging from serial philandering to insider trading to shoplifting suits in Canada to fabricating war hero credentials for his father and academic achievements and degrees for himself.  He has had to resign from politics in disgrace on three occasions -- in 1974 as a member of Parliament, in 1986 as deputy chairman of the Conservative Party and in 1999 as Tory candidate for mayor of London when the current case arose.  He reacted to that fall from grace in the kind of risky and brash fashion that has made him one of Britain's longest-running tabloid personalities.  He wrote a courtroom play called ''The Accused'' and cast himself in the role of the defendant.  In a striking piece of timing, he appeared for the first night in his stage role on the same day that he had to appear at a police station to be formally arrested for perjury.  Until today, he had always bounced back, writing his best-seller books and even persuading John Major, the Conservative prime minister, to make him a life peer in 1992 despite the fact that he had continually brought shame on the party.  Justice Potts told Lord Archer today that he could not overlook the fact that after committing a crime, ''you have gone from strength to strength, you resumed your political career and, at some point, were ennobled to become a member of the House of Lords.

He was born in Paris.  His two brothers Salomon Reinach and Theodore Reinach would later be known in the field of archaeology.  After studying at Lycee Condorcet, he was called to the bar in 1887.  He attracted the attention of Leon Gambetta by writing articles on Balkan politics for the Revue bleue, and joined the staff of the Republique francaise.  In Gambetta's grand ministere, Reinach was his secretary and tried to obtain a partial revision of the constitution and list proportional representation.  In the Republique francaise he waged a steady war against General Boulanger, which resulted in three duels, one with Edmond Magnier and two with Paul Deroulede.  Between 1889 and 1898, he sat for the Chamber of Deputies for Digne.  As a member of the army commission, reporter of the budgets of the ministries of the interior and of agriculture he brought forward bills for the better treatment of the insane, for the establishment of a colonial ministry, for the taxation of alcoholic beverages, and for the reparation of judicial errors.  He advocated complete freedom of the theatre and the press, the abolition of public executions, and denounced political corruption of all kinds.  However, Reinach is best known as the champion of Alfred Dreyfus.  At the time of the original trial, he attempted to secure a public hearing of the case, and, in 1897, he allied himself with Auguste Scheurer-Kestner to demand its revision.  He denounced in the Siecle the Henry forgery and Esterhazy's complicity.  His articles in the Siecle aroused the fury of the anti-Dreyfus party, especially as Reinach was a Jew and was accused by some of taking up Dreyfus's defence on racial grounds.  He lost his seat in the Chamber of Deputies and, having refused to fight Henri Rochefort, an anti-Dreyfus journalist, eventually brought an action for libel against the latter.  Finally, Dreyfus was pardoned, Reinach wrote a history of the case that was completed in 1905.  Henri Dutrait-Croyon's Joseph Reinach, historien (Paris: A.  Savaete, 1905), a violent detailed rebuttal of Reinach's history that \"became a bible for that anti-Semitic section of French public opinion convinced of the culpability of Dreyfus. \" In 1906, Reinach was re-elected for Digne.  In that year, he became a member of the commission of the national archives, and the following year a member of the council on prisons.  Reinach was a prolific writer on political subjects.  He published three volumes on Leon Gambetta in 1884 and also edited Gambetta's speeches.  Joseph and his wife Henriette-Clementine had a son, Adolphe Reinach, born in 1887.  Adolphe became an archaeologist and Egyptologist known mainly for his discovery of the Coptos Decrees.  He was killed in the first month of the First World War, in August 1914. ", "article_1": "It was through mediations of Francis Wey, a great friend of Berlioz, that the musician agreed to sit for a portrait at Courbet's studio in 1850.  Courbet must have been delighted at such an opportunity.  Berlioz, then aged about forty-five years old, was an important figure on the artistic scene, and was a good friend of Victor Hugo, whom Courbet admired.  However, the meeting was not a success.  Berlioz was a secretive man, easily offended.  Courbet, on the other hand, prided himself on his musical ability, and took advantage of the composer's presence to demonstrate his talents as a singer.  \"During the sittings\", recounted Georges Kial, \"[Courbet] took it into his head to sing his songs, \"tuneless laments\" [. . . ] and to offer them as examples of popular music.  At first Berlioz thought it was a joke; then, realising that to Courbet it was nothing of the sort, he took him for an idiot\".  We do not know if it was his annoyance over this that caused Berlioz to refuse the portrait once it was finished.  The work fits into the pictorial tradition, with the face standing out against a dark background.  It also draws on the Romantic image of the melancholic musician.  But it must be said that Courbet did not present a flattering image of the composer.  He made Berlioz look much older; the painter did not make any concessions for his gaunt face.  Keeping to his principles, Courbet took \"the true image of the model's face\", without trying to give Berlioz's thin, wiry body, the grandiloquence of his compositions.  Nadar, on the other hand, in a much later photograph, created a monumental portrait of Berlioz, using the device of a broad, thick coat.  In spite of everything Courbet was rather attached to the painting, as we can see by its presence in the artist's private exhibitions in 1855 and 1867.  Still regularly exhibited after the painter's death, this portrait has become, somewhat ironically, the most famous image of Berlioz.  Courbet Dossier", "article_2": "The Reinachs were a family of French scholars and politicians.  JOSEPH REINACH (1856-1921), political leader, journalist, and historian, was born in Paris.  He graduated from the University of Paris and became a lawyer, also writing several works on European politics.  Reinach's articles on foreign policy in the Revue Bleue were noticed by Leon Gambetta, who, when he became premier in 1881, made Reinach his chef du cabinet.  After Gambetta's death, Reinach became political editor of the Republique Francaise.  He was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1889 and reelected in 1893.  One of the first to demand a new trial for Captain *Dreyfus , Reinach was subject to bitter attacks from the anti-Dreyfusards, lost his seat in the elections of 1898, and was dismissed from the army in which he was a reserve captain.  Following Dreyfus' rehabilitation, Reinach was reinstated and reelected to parliament, where he served until his retirement in 1914.  Reinach's historical works include a seven-volume history of the Dreyfus Affair, Histoire de l'Affaire Dreyfus (1901-11).  While campaigning for the Dreyfus cause, he wrote a history of the case of Raphael Levy who was executed in 1670 on a ritual murder charge (Raphael Levy, 1898).  Reinach published many works on general history and politics.  Solomon (1858-1932), archaeologist, philologist, and historian, was a brother of Joseph.  As a member of the Ecole Francaise d'Athenes he took part in several excavations in Greece.  He taught archaeology at the Ecole de Louvre and from 1886 served as curator of the Musee d'Antiquites Nationales at his native St.  Germain-en-Laye.  In 1893 he was appointed assistant keeper of the Musees Nationales, becoming keeper in 1902.  He was a member of the Institut Francais and of the Conseil Superieur des Beaux Arts.  Reinach's scholarly work was devoted primarily to French archaeology and Gallic civilization.  He also made numerous contributions to classical and French philology, the history of art, and the history of religion.  His major work in the latter field, Orpheus; histoire generale des religions (1909, 19262; Eng.  1909, 19302; repr.  1942; Ger.  1910), is written in the Voltairean tradition of radical rationalism.  It classifies Judaism and Christianity as \"barbaric,\" and accepting the conclusions of contemporary Bible criticism, termed many biblical figures as mythical.  Reinach has nothing but disdain for the Talmud and \"for those backward Jews who follow its rules. \" Nevertheless, he took an active part in Jewish affairs.  A confirmed Dreyfusard, like his brothers, he published a French translation of H. C.  Lea's History of the Inquisition (3 vols. , 1901-03) at the height of the Dreyfus Affair as a weapon in the fight against religious intolerance.  He published various articles in the *Revue des Etudes Juives and served as president of the Societe des Etudes Juives.  He was vice president of the Alliance Israelite Universelle and helped in the establishment of the *Jewish Colonization Association .  Anti-Zionist in principle, Reinach nevertheless gave assistance to colonization in Palestine.  Theodore (1860-1928), younger brother of Joseph and Solomon, was a scholar and politician.  His studies extended to law, archaeology, mathematics, numismatics, and history of music and of religion.  Reinach was appointed professor at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes where he taught the history of religions.  He was also editor of the Revue des Etudes Grecques.  A member of the Institut de France, Reinach presented a musical interpretation of a Delphic paean and himself played this resurrection of ancient music.  He served in the Chamber of Deputies of Savoy during 1906-14.  Active in the rather ineffective movement of French Reform Judaism (Union Liberale Israelite) and a confirmed assimilationist, he strongly opposed Zionism, believing that since the French Revolution Jews no longer were a nation but only a religious community.  He presented these views in his widely read Histoire des Israelites (1884, 19104).  He also wrote a Histoire sommaire de l'affaire Dreyfus (1904, 1924).  In the field of Jewish scholarship Reinach was important as a student of Jewish numismatics (Les monnaies juives, 1887) and as the editor of an important reference book, Textes d'auteurs grecs et romains relatifs au Judaisme (1895; repr.  1963).  He was the general editor of a French translation of the works of Josephus (7 vols. , 1900-32), completed after his death by his brother Solomon.  Reinach also contributed to the Revue des Etudes Juives, and various French encyclopedias.  BIBLIOGRAPHY: H.  Rigault, M.  Joseph Reinach (Fr. , 1889); S.

He created roughly 900 oil paintings and more than 2,000 watercolors, as well as countless sketches and charcoal drawings.  His oeuvre documents worldwide travel, from Venice to the Tyrol, Corfu, the Middle East, Montana, Maine, and Florida.  Born in Florence to American parents, he was trained in Paris before moving to London, living most of his life in Europe.  He enjoyed international acclaim as a portrait painter.  An early submission to the Paris Salon in the 1880s, his Portrait of Madame X, was intended to consolidate his position as a society painter in Paris, but instead resulted in scandal.  During the next year following the scandal, Sargent departed for England where he continued a successful career as a portrait artist.  From the beginning, Sargent's work is characterized by remarkable technical facility, particularly in his ability to draw with a brush, which in later years inspired admiration as well as criticism for a supposed superficiality.  His commissioned works were consistent with the grand manner of portraiture, while his informal studies and landscape paintings displayed a familiarity with Impressionism.  In later life Sargent expressed ambivalence about the restrictions of formal portrait work, and devoted much of his energy to mural painting and working en plein air.  Art historians generally ignored society artists such as Sargent until the late 20th century. Sargent is a descendant of Epes Sargent, a colonial military leader and jurist.  Before John Singer Sargent's birth, his father, FitzWilliam (b.  1820 Gloucester, Massachusetts), was an eye surgeon at the Wills Eye Hospital in Philadelphia 1844-1854.  After John's older sister died at the age of two, his mother, Mary Newbold Singer (nee Singer, 1826-1906), suffered a breakdown, and the couple decided to go abroad to recover. They remained nomadic expatriates for the rest of their lives. Although based in Paris, Sargent's parents moved regularly with the seasons to the sea and the mountain resorts in France, Germany, Italy, and Switzerland.  While Mary was pregnant, they stopped in Florence, Tuscany, because of a cholera epidemic.  Sargent was born there in 1856.  A year later, his sister Mary was born.  After her birth, FitzWilliam reluctantly resigned his post in Philadelphia and accepted his wife's request to remain abroad. They lived modestly on a small inheritance and savings, leading a quiet life with their children.  They generally avoided society and other Americans except for friends in the art world. Four more children were born abroad, of whom only two lived past childhood. Although his father was a patient teacher of basic subjects, young Sargent was a rambunctious child, more interested in outdoor activities than his studies.  As his father wrote home, \"He is quite a close observer of animated nature. \" His mother was convinced that traveling around Europe, and visiting museums and churches, would give young Sargent a satisfactory education.  Several attempts to have him formally schooled failed, owing mostly to their itinerant life.  His mother was a capable amateur artist and his father was a skilled medical illustrator. Early on, she gave him sketchbooks and encouraged drawing excursions.  Sargent worked on his drawings, and he enthusiastically copied images from The Illustrated London News of ships and made detailed sketches of landscapes. FitzWilliam had hoped that his son's interest in ships and the sea might lead him toward a naval career.  At thirteen, his mother reported that John \"sketches quite nicely, & has a remarkably quick and correct eye.  If we could afford to give him really good lessons, he would soon be quite a little artist. \" At the age of thirteen, he received some watercolor lessons from Carl Welsch, a German landscape painter. Although his education was far from complete, Sargent grew up to be a highly literate and cosmopolitan young man, accomplished in art, music, and literature. He was fluent in English, French, Italian, and German.  At seventeen, Sargent was described as \"willful, curious, determined and strong\" (after his mother) yet shy, generous, and modest (after his father). He was well-acquainted with many of the great masters from first hand observation, as he wrote in 1874, \"I have learned in Venice to admire Tintoretto immensely and to consider him perhaps second only to Michelangelo and Titian. An attempt to study at the Academy of Florence failed, as the school was re-organizing at the time.  After returning to Paris from Florence Sargent began his art studies with the young French portraitist Carolus-Duran.  Following a meteoric rise, the artist was noted for his bold technique and modern teaching methods; his influence would be pivotal to Sargent during the period from 1874 to 1878. In 1874 Sargent passed on his first attempt the rigorous exam required to gain admission to the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, the premier art school in France.  He took drawing classes, which included anatomy and perspective, and gained a silver prize. He also spent much time in self-study, drawing in museums and painting in a studio he shared with James Carroll Beckwith.  He became both a valuable friend and Sargent's primary connection with the American artists abroad. Sargent also took some lessons from Leon Bonnat. Carolus-Duran's atelier was progressive, dispensing with the traditional academic approach, which required careful drawing and underpainting, in favor of the alla prima method of working directly on the canvas with a loaded brush, derived from Diego Velazquez.  It was an approach that relied on the proper placement of tones of paint. This approach also permitted spontaneous flourishes of color not bound to an under-drawing.  It was markedly different from the traditional atelier of Jean-Leon Gerome, where Americans Thomas Eakins and Julian Alden Weir had studied.  Sargent was the star student in short order.  Weir met Sargent in 1874 and noted that Sargent was \"one of the most talented fellows I have ever come across; his drawings are like the old masters, and his color is equally fine. \" Sargent's excellent command of French and his superior talent made him both popular and admired.  Through his friendship with Paul Cesar Helleu, Sargent would meet giants of the art world, including Degas, Rodin, Monet, and Whistler.  Sargent's early enthusiasm was for landscapes, not portraiture, as evidenced by his voluminous sketches full of mountains, seascapes, and buildings. Carolus-Duran's expertise in portraiture finally influenced Sargent in that direction.  Commissions for history paintings were still considered more prestigious, but were much harder to get.  Portrait painting, on the other hand, was the best way of promoting an art career, getting exhibited in the Salon, and gaining commissions to earn a livelihood.  Sargent's first major portrait was of his friend Fanny Watts in 1877, and was also his first Salon admission.  Its particularly well-executed pose drew attention. His second salon entry was the Oyster Gatherers of Cancale, an impressionistic painting of which he made two copies, one of which he sent back to the United States, and both received warm reviews. In 1879, at the age of 23, Sargent painted a portrait of teacher Carolus-Duran; the virtuoso effort met with public approval and announced the direction his mature work would take.  Its showing at the Paris Salon was both a tribute to his teacher and an advertisement for portrait commissions. Of Sargent's early work, Henry James wrote that the artist offered \"the slightly 'uncanny' spectacle of a talent which on the very threshold of its career has nothing more to learn. \" After leaving Carolus-Duran's atelier, Sargent visited Spain.  There he studied the paintings of Velazquez with a passion, absorbing the master's technique, and in his travels gathered ideas for future works. He was entranced with Spanish music and dance.  The trip also re-awakened his own talent for music (which was nearly equal to his artistic talent), and which found visual expression in his early masterpiece El Jaleo (1882).  Music would continue to play a major part in his social life as well, as he was a skillful accompanist of both amateur and professional musicians.  Sargent became a strong advocate for modern composers, especially Gabriel Faure. Trips to Italy provided sketches and ideas for several Venetian street scenes genre paintings, which effectively captured gestures and postures he would find useful in later portraiture. Upon his return to Paris, Sargent quickly received several portrait commissions.  His career was launched.  He immediately demonstrated the concentration and stamina that enabled him to paint with workman-like steadiness for the next twenty-five years.  He filled in the gaps between commissions with many non-commissioned portraits of friends and colleagues.  His fine manners, perfect French, and great skill made him a standout among the newer portraitists, and his fame quickly spread.  He confidently set high prices and turned down unsatisfactory sitters. He mentored his friend Emil Fuchs who was learning to paint portraits in oils. Nineteenth-century portraits  In the early 1880s, Sargent regularly exhibited portraits at the Salon, and these were mostly full-length portrayals of women, such as Madame Edouard Pailleron (1880) (done en plein-air) and Madame Ramon Subercaseaux (1881).  He continued to receive positive critical notice. Sargent's best portraits reveal the individuality and personality of the sitters; his most ardent admirers think he is matched in this only by Velazquez, who was one of Sargent's great influences.  The Spanish master's spell is apparent in Sargent's The Daughters of Edward Darley Boit, 1882, a haunting interior that echoes Velazquez's Las Meninas. As in many of his early portraits, Sargent confidently tries different approaches with each new challenge, here employing both unusual composition and lighting to striking effect.  One of his most widely exhibited and best loved works of the 1880s was The Lady with the Rose (1882), a portrait of Charlotte Burckhardt, a close friend and possible romantic attachment. Portrait of Madame X 1884 1884 His most controversial work, Portrait of Madame X (Madame Pierre Gautreau) (1884) is now considered one of his best works, and was the artist's personal favorite; he stated in 1915, \"I suppose it is the best thing I have done. \" When unveiled in Paris at the 1884 Salon, it aroused such a negative reaction that it likely prompted Sargent's move to London.  Sargent's self-confidence had led him to attempt a risque experiment in portraiture--but this time it unexpectedly backfired. The painting was not commissioned by her and he pursued her for the opportunity, quite unlike most of his portrait work where clients sought him out.  Sargent wrote to a common acquaintance: I have a great desire to paint her portrait and have reason to think she would allow it and is waiting for someone to propose this homage to her beauty.  . . . you might tell her that I am a man of prodigious talent. It took well over a year to complete the painting. The first version of the portrait of Madame Gautreau, with the famously plunging neckline, white-powdered skin, and arrogantly cocked head, featured an intentionally suggestive off-the-shoulder dress strap, on her right side only, which made the overall effect more daring and sensual. Sargent repainted the strap to its expected over-the-shoulder position to try to dampen the furor, but the damage had been done.  French commissions dried up and he told his friend Edmund Gosse in 1885 that he contemplated giving up painting for music or business. Writing of the reaction of visitors, Judith Gautier observed: Is it a woman? a chimera, the figure of a unicorn rearing as on a heraldic coat of arms or perhaps the work of some oriental decorative artist to whom the human form is forbidden and who, wishing to be reminded of woman, has drawn the delicious arabesque? No, it is none of these things, but rather the precise image of a modern woman scrupulously drawn by a painter who is a master of his art. \" Prior to the Madame X scandal of 1884, Sargent had painted exotic beauties such as Rosina Ferrara of Capri, and the Spanish expatriate model Carmela Bertagna, but the earlier pictures had not been intended for broad public reception.  Sargent kept the painting prominently displayed in his London studio until he sold it to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1916 after moving to the United States, and a few months after Gautreau's death.  Before arriving in England, Sargent began sending paintings for exhibition at the Royal Academy.  These included the portraits of Dr.  Pozzi at Home (1881), a flamboyant essay in red and his first full-length male portrait, and the more traditional Mrs.  Henry White (1883).  The ensuing portrait commissions encouraged Sargent to complete his move to London in 1886.  Notwithstanding the Madame X scandal, he had considered moving to London as early as 1882; he had been urged to do so repeatedly by his new friend, the novelist Henry James.  In retrospect his transfer to London may be seen to have been inevitable. English critics were not warm at first, faulting Sargent for his \"clever\" \"Frenchified\" handling of paint.  One reviewer seeing his portrait of Mrs.  Henry White described his technique as \"hard\" and \"almost metallic\" with \"no taste in expression, air, or modeling. \" With help from Mrs.  White, however, Sargent soon gained the admiration of English patrons and critics. Henry James also gave the artist \"a push to the best of my ability. \" Sargent spent much time painting outdoors in the English countryside when not in his studio.  On a visit to Monet at Giverny in 1885, Sargent painted one of his most Impressionistic portraits, of Monet at work painting outdoors with his new bride nearby.  Sargent is usually not thought of as an Impressionist painter, but he sometimes used impressionistic techniques to great effect.  His Claude Monet Painting at the Edge of a Wood is rendered in his own version of the Impressionist style.  In the 1880s, he attended the Impressionist exhibitions and he began to paint outdoors in the plein-air manner after that visit to Monet.  Sargent purchased four Monet works for his personal collection during that time. Sargent was similarly inspired to do a portrait of his artist friend Paul Cesar Helleu, also painting outdoors with his wife by his side.  A photograph very similar to the painting suggests that Sargent occasionally used photography as an aid to composition. Through Helleu, Sargent met and painted the famed French sculptor Auguste Rodin in 1884, a rather somber portrait reminiscent of works by Thomas Eakins. Although the British critics classified Sargent in the Impressionist camp, the French Impressionists thought otherwise.  As Monet later stated, \"He is not an Impressionist in the sense that we use the word, he is too much under the influence of Carolus-Duran. \" Sargent's first major success at the Royal Academy came in 1887, with the enthusiastic response to Carnation, Lily, Lily, Rose, a large piece, painted on site, of two young girls lighting lanterns in an English garden in Broadway in the Cotswolds.  The painting was immediately purchased by the Tate Gallery.  His first trip to New York and Boston as a professional artist in 1887-88 produced over 20 important commissions, including portraits of Isabella Stewart Gardner, the famed Boston art patron.  His portrait of Mrs.  Adrian Iselin, wife of a New York businessman, revealed her character in one of his most insightful works.  In Boston, Sargent was honored with his first solo exhibition, which presented 22 of his paintings. Here he became friends with painter Dennis Miller Bunker, who traveled to England in the summer of 1888 to paint with him en plein air, and is the subject of Sargent's 1888 painting Dennis Miller Bunker Painting at Calcot.  Back in London, Sargent was quickly busy again.  His working methods were by then well-established, following many of the steps employed by other master portrait painters before him.  After securing a commission through negotiations which he carried out, Sargent would visit the client's home to see where the painting was to hang.  He would often review a client's wardrobe to pick suitable attire.  Some portraits were done in the client's home, but more often in his studio, which was well-stocked with furniture and background materials he chose for proper effect. He usually required eight to ten sittings from his clients, although he would try to capture the face in one sitting.  He usually kept up pleasant conversation and sometimes he would take a break and play the piano for his sitter.  Sargent seldom used pencil or oil sketches, and instead laid down oil paint directly. Finally, he would select an appropriate frame.  Sargent had no assistants; he handled all the tasks, such as preparing his canvases, varnishing the painting, arranging for photography, shipping, and documentation.  He commanded about $5,000 per portrait, or about $130,000 in current dollars. Some American clients traveled to London at their own expense to have Sargent paint their portrait.  Morning Walk, 1888, private collection , 1888, private collection Clementina Anstruther-Thomson, 1889 Around 1890, Sargent painted two daring non-commissioned portraits as show pieces--one of actress Ellen Terry as Lady Macbeth and one of the popular Spanish dancer La Carmencita. Sargent was elected an associate of the Royal Academy, and was made a full member three years later.  In the 1890s, he averaged fourteen portrait commissions per year, none more beautiful than the genteel Lady Agnew of Lochnaw, 1892.  His portrait of Mrs.  Hugh Hammersley (Mrs.  Hugh Hammersley, 1892) was equally well received for its lively depiction of one of London's most notable hostesses.  As a portrait painter in the grand manner, Sargent had unmatched success; he portrayed subjects who were at once ennobled and often possessed of nervous energy.  Sargent was referred to as \"the Van Dyck of our times. \" Although Sargent was an American expatriate, he returned to the United States many times, often to answer the demand for commissioned portraits.  Sargent exhibited nine of his portraits in the Palace of Fine Arts at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Sargent painted a series of three portraits of Robert Louis Stevenson.  The second, Portrait of Robert Louis Stevenson and his Wife (1885), was one of his best known. He also completed portraits of two U. S.  presidents: Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson.  Asher Wertheimer, a wealthy Jewish art dealer living in London, commissioned from Sargent a series of a dozen portraits of his family, the artist's largest commission from a single patron. The Wertheimer portraits reveal a pleasant familiarity between the artist and his subjects.  Wertheimer bequeathed most of the paintings to the National Gallery. In 1888, Sargent released his portrait of Alice Vanderbilt Shepard, great-granddaughter of Cornelius Vanderbilt. Many of his most important works are in museums in the United States.  In 1897, a friend sponsored a famous portrait in oil of Mr.  and Mrs.  I.  N.  Phelps Stokes, by Sargent, as a wedding gift. John Singer Sargent, Portrait of Angela McInnes, 1915.  Charcoal on paper.  en turquerie.  Sargent emphasized Almina Wertheimer's exotic beauty in 1908 by dressing her Repose.  John Singer Sargent.  1911 By 1900, Sargent was at the height of his fame.  Cartoonist Max Beerbohm completed one of his seventeen caricatures of Sargent, making well known to the public the artist's paunchy physique. Although only in his forties, Sargent began to travel more and to devote relatively less time to portrait painting.  His An Interior in Venice (1900), a portrait of four members of the Curtis family in their elegant palatial home, Palazzo Barbaro, was a resounding success.  But, Whistler did not approve of the looseness of Sargent's brushwork, which he summed up as \"smudge everywhere. \" One of Sargent's last major portraits in his bravura style was that of Lord Ribblesdale, in 1902, finely attired in an elegant hunting uniform.  Between 1900 and 1907, Sargent continued his high productivity, which included, in addition to dozens of oil portraits, hundreds of portrait drawings at about $400 each. In 1907, at the age of fifty-one, Sargent officially closed his studio.  Relieved, he stated, \"Painting a portrait would be quite amusing if one were not forced to talk while working. . . What a nuisance having to entertain the sitter and to look happy when one feels wretched. \" In that same year, Sargent painted his modest and serious self-portrait, his last, for the celebrated self-portrait collection of the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, Italy. Sargent made several summer visits to the Swiss Alps with his sisters Emily and Violet (Mrs Ormond) and Violet's daughters Rose-Marie and Reine, who were the subject of a number of paintings 1906-1913. As Sargent wearied of portraiture he pursued architectural and landscapes subjects.  During a visit to Rome in 1906 Sargent made an oil painting and several pencil sketches of the exterior staircase and balustrade in front of the Church of Saints Dominic and Sixtus, now the church of the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum.  The double staircase built in 1654 is the design of architect and sculptor Orazio Torriani (fl. 1602-1657).  In 1907 he wrote: \"I did in Rome a study of a magnificent curved staircase and balustrade, leading to a grand facade that would reduce a millionaire to a worm. . . . \" The painting now hangs at the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford University and the pencil sketches are in the collection of the Harvard University art collection of the Fogg Museum. Sargent later used the architectural features of this stair and balustrade in a portrait of Charles William Eliot, President of Harvard University from 1869 to 1909. Sargent's fame was still considerable and museums eagerly bought his works.  That year he declined a knighthood and decided instead to keep his American citizenship.  From 1907 on, Sargent largely forsook portrait painting and focused on landscapes.  He made numerous visits to the United States in the last decade of his life, including a stay of two full years from 1915 to 1917. In April 1917 Sargent was visiting the Miami estate of James Deering and was invited to cruise the Florida Keys with James and his brother Charles Deering aboard James' yacht Nepenthe.  Sargent was much more interested in the \"mine of sketching\" that was the estate, not at all interested in fishing, and made the cruise \"reluctantly,\" doing some watercolor sketches (including Derelicts, 1917). By the time Sargent finished his portrait of John D.  Rockefeller in 1917, most critics began to consign him to the masters of the past, \"a brilliant ambassador between his patrons and posterity. \" Modernists treated him more harshly, considering him completely out of touch with the reality of American life and with emerging artistic trends including Cubism and Futurism. Sargent quietly accepted the criticism, but refused to alter his negative opinions of modern art.  He retorted, \"Ingres, Raphael and El Greco, these are now my admirations, these are what I like. \" In 1925, shortly before he died, Sargent painted his last oil portrait, a canvas of Grace Curzon, Marchioness Curzon of Kedleston.  The painting was purchased in 1936 by the Currier Museum of Art, where it is on display. Gondoliers' Siesta, c.  1904, watercolor , c.  1904, watercolor During Sargent's long career, he painted more than 2,000 watercolors, roving from the English countryside to Venice to the Tyrol, Corfu, the Middle East, Montana, Maine, and Florida.  Each destination offered pictorial stimulation and treasure.  Even at his leisure, in escaping the pressures of the portrait studio, he painted with restless intensity, often painting from morning until night.  His hundreds of watercolors of Venice are especially notable, many done from the perspective of a gondola.  His colors were sometimes extremely vivid and as one reviewer noted, \"Everything is given with the intensity of a dream. \" In the Middle East and North Africa Sargent painted Bedouins, goatherds, and fisherman.  In the last decade of his life, he produced many watercolors in Maine, Florida, and in the American West, of fauna, flora, and native peoples.  Muddy Alligators, 1917, watercolor , 1917, watercolor With his watercolors, Sargent was able to indulge his earliest artistic inclinations for nature, architecture, exotic peoples, and noble mountain landscapes.  And it is in some of his late works where one senses Sargent painting most purely for himself.  His watercolors were executed with a joyful fluidness.  He also painted extensively family, friends, gardens, and fountains.  In watercolors, he playfully portrayed his friends and family dressed in Orientalist costume, relaxing in brightly lit landscapes that allowed for a more vivid palette and experimental handling than did his commissions (The Chess Game, 1906). His first major solo exhibit of watercolor works was at the Carfax Gallery in London in 1905. In 1909, he exhibited eighty-six watercolors in New York City, eighty-three of which were bought by the Brooklyn Museum. Evan Charteris wrote in 1927: To live with Sargent's water-colours is to live with sunshine captured and held, with the luster of a bright and legible world, 'the refluent shade' and 'the Ambient ardours of the noon. ' Although not generally accorded the critical respect given Winslow Homer, perhaps America's greatest watercolorist, scholarship has revealed that Sargent was fluent in the entire range of opaque and transparent watercolor technique, including the methods used by Homer. Theodore Roosevelt, 1903.  Sargent had Roosevelt hold his pose when he turned around with impatience to address the artist while they were walking around the , 1903.  Sargent had Roosevelt hold his pose when he turned around with impatience to address the artist while they were walking around the White House surveying possible locations for the portrait. As a concession to the insatiable demand of wealthy patrons for portraits, Sargent dashed off hundreds of rapid charcoal portrait sketches, which he called \"Mugs\".  Forty-six of these, spanning the years 1890-1916, were exhibited at the Royal Society of Portrait Painters in 1916. All of Sargent's murals are to be found in the Boston/Cambridge area.  They are in the Boston Public Library, the Museum of Fine Arts, and Harvard's Widener Library.  Sargent's largest scale works are the mural decorations that grace the Boston Public Library depicting the history of religion and the gods of polytheism. They were attached to the walls of the library by means of marouflage.  He worked on the cycle for almost thirty years but never completed the final mural.  Sargent drew on his extensive travels and museum visits to create a dense art historical melange.  The murals were restored in 2003-2004. Sargent worked on the murals from 1895 through 1919; they were intended to show religion's (and society's) progress, from pagan superstition up through the ascension of Christianity, concluding with a painting depicting Jesus delivering the Sermon on the Mount.  But Sargent's paintings of \"The Church\" and \"The Synagogue\", installed in late 1919, inspired a debate about whether the artist had represented Judaism in a stereotypical, or even an anti-Semitic, manner. Drawing upon iconography that was used in medieval paintings, Sargent portrayed Judaism and the synagogue as a blind, ugly hag, and Christianity and the church as a lovely, radiant young woman.  He also failed to understand how these representations might be problematic for the Jews of Boston; he was both surprised and hurt when the paintings were criticized. The paintings were objectionable to Boston Jews since they seemed to show Judaism defeated, and Christianity triumphant. The Boston newspapers also followed the controversy, noting that while many found the paintings offensive, not everyone was in agreement.  In the end, Sargent abandoned his plan to finish the murals, and the controversy eventually died down.  Upon his return to England in 1918 after a visit to the United States, Sargent was commissioned as a war artist by the British Ministry of Information.  In his large painting Gassed and in many watercolors, he depicted scenes from the Great War. Sargent had been affected by the death of his niece Rose-Marie in the shelling of the St Gervais church, Paris, on Good Friday 1918. Sargent was a lifelong bachelor with a wide circle of friends including both men and women such as Oscar Wilde (whom he was neighbors with for several years), lesbian author Violet Paget, and his likely lover Albert de Belleroche.  Biographers once portrayed him as staid and reticent. However, recent scholarship has theorised he was a private, complex and passionate man whose homosexual identity was integral to shaping his art. This view is based on statements by his friends and associations, the overall alluring remoteness of his portraits, the way his works challenge 19th-century notions of gender difference, his previously ignored male nudes, and some nude male portraits, including those of Thomas E.  McKeller, Bartholomy Maganosco, Olimpio Fusco, and that of aristocratic artist Albert de Belleroche, which hung in his Chelsea dining room. Sargent had a long friendship with Belleroche, whom he met in 1882 and traveled with frequently.  A surviving drawing suggests Sargent might have used him as a model for Madame X, following a coincidence of dates for Sargent drawing each of them separately around the same time, and the delicate pose suggestive more of Sargent's sketches of the male form than his often stiff commissions.  It has been suggested that Sargent's reputation in the 1890s as \"the painter of the Jews\" may have been due to his empathy with, and complicit enjoyment of their mutual social otherness. One such Jewish client, Betty Wertheimer, wrote that when in Venice, Sargent \"was only interested in the Venetian gondoliers\". The painter Jacques-Emile Blanche, who was one of his early sitters, said after Sargent's death that his sex life \"was notorious in Paris, and in Venice, positively scandalous.  He was a frenzied bugger. \" There were many relationships with women: it has been suggested that those with his sitters Rosina Ferrara, Virginie Gautreau, and Judith Gautier may have tipped into infatuation. As a young man, Sargent also courted for a time Louise Burkhardt, the model for Lady with the Rose. Sargent's friends and supporters included Henry James, Isabella Stewart Gardner (who commissioned and purchased works from Sargent, and sought his advice on other acquisitions), Edward VII, and Paul Cesar Helleu.  His associations also included Prince Edmond de Polignac and Count Robert de Montesquiou.  Other artists Sargent associated with were Dennis Miller Bunker, James Carroll Beckwith, Edwin Austin Abbey and John Elliott (who also worked on the Boston Public Library murals), Francis David Millet, Joaquin Sorolla and Claude Monet, whom Sargent painted.  Between 1905 and 1914, Sargent's frequent traveling companions were the married artist couple Wilfrid de Glehn and Jane Emmet de Glehn.  The trio would often spend summers in France, Spain or Italy, and all three would depict one another in their paintings during their travels. Arsene Vigeant, 1885, Musees de Metz , 1885, Musees de Metz In a time when the art world focused, in turn, on Impressionism, Fauvism, and Cubism, Sargent practiced his own form of Realism, which made brilliant references to Velazquez, Van Dyck, and Gainsborough.  His seemingly effortless facility for paraphrasing the masters in a contemporary fashion led to a stream of commissioned portraits of remarkable virtuosity (Arsene Vigeant, 1885, Musees de Metz; Mr.  and Mrs.  Isaac Newton Phelps-Stokes, 1897, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) and earned Sargent the moniker, \"the Van Dyck of our times. \" Still, during his life his work engendered negative responses from some of his colleagues: Camille Pissarro wrote \"he is not an enthusiast but rather an adroit performer,\" and Walter Sickert published a satirical turn under the heading \"Sargentolatry. \" By the time of his death he was dismissed as an anachronism, a relic of the Gilded Age and out of step with the artistic sentiments of post-World War I Europe.  Elizabeth Prettejohn suggests that the decline of Sargent's reputation was due partly to the rise of anti-Semitism, and the resultant intolerance of 'celebrations of Jewish prosperity. ' It has been suggested that the exotic qualities inherent in his work appealed to the sympathies of the Jewish clients whom he painted from the 1890s on.  Nowhere is this more apparent than in his portrait Almina, Daughter of Asher Wertheimer (1908), in which the subject is seen wearing a Persian costume, a pearl encrusted turban, and strumming an Indian tambura, accoutrements all meant to convey sensuality and mystery.  If Sargent used this portrait to explore issues of sexuality and identity, it seems to have met with the satisfaction of the subject's father, Asher Wertheimer, a wealthy Jewish art dealer. Claude Monet Painting by the Edge of a Wood, 1885, the , 1885, the Tate , London Foremost of Sargent's detractors was the influential English art critic Roger Fry, of the Bloomsbury Group, who at the 1926 Sargent retrospective in London dismissed Sargent's work as lacking aesthetic quality: \"Wonderful indeed, but most wonderful that this wonderful performance should ever have been confused with that of an artist. \" And, in the 1930s, Lewis Mumford led a chorus of the severest critics: \"Sargent remained to the end an illustrator . . .  the most adroit appearance of workmanship, the most dashing eye for effect, cannot conceal the essential emptiness of Sargent's mind, or the contemptuous and cynical superficiality of a certain part of his execution. \" Part of Sargent's devaluation is also attributed to his expatriate life, which made him seem less American at a time when \"authentic\" socially conscious American art, as exemplified by the Stieglitz circle and by the Ashcan School, was on the ascent. After such a long period of critical disfavor, Sargent's reputation has increased steadily since the 1950s. In the 1960s, a revival of Victorian art and new scholarship directed at Sargent strengthened his reputation. Sargent has been the subject of large-scale exhibitions in major museums, including a retrospective exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1986, and a major 1999 traveling show that exhibited at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the National Gallery of Art Washington, and the National Gallery, London.  In 1986, Andy Warhol commented to Sargent scholar Trevor Fairbrother that Sargent \"made everybody look glamorous.  Taller.  Thinner.  But they all have mood, every one of them has a different mood. \" In a TIME magazine article from the 1980s, critic Robert Hughes praised Sargent as \"the unrivaled recorder of male power and female beauty in a day that, like ours, paid excessive court to both. In 1922 Sargent co-founded New York City's Grand Central Art Galleries together with Edmund Greacen, Walter Leighton Clark, and others. Sargent actively participated in the Grand Central Art Galleries and their academy, the Grand Central School of Art, until his death in 1925.  The Galleries held a major retrospective exhibit of Sargent's work in 1924. He then returned to England, where he died at his Chelsea home on April 14, 1925, of heart disease. Sargent is interred in Brookwood Cemetery near Woking, Surrey. Memorial exhibitions of Sargent's work were held in Boston in 1925, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and at the Royal Academy and Tate Gallery in London in 1926. The Grand Central Art Galleries also organized a posthumous exhibition in 1928 of previously unseen sketches and drawings from throughout his career. Portrait of Robert Louis Stevenson and his Wife was sold in 2004 for US$8. 8 million and is located at Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art at Bentonville, Arkansas.  In December 2004, Group with Parasols (A Siesta) (1905) sold for US$23. 5 million, nearly double the Sotheby's estimate of $12 million.  The previous highest price for a Sargent painting was US$11 million. In 2018, Comedy Central star Jade Esteban Estrada wrote, directed and starred in Madame X: A Burlesque Fantasy, a story based on the life of Sargent and his famous painting, Portrait of Madame X.

In 1874 he was accepted at the Paris atelier of the portraitist Emile Auguste Carolus-Duran, and attended drawing classes at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts.  He began to exhibit at the Salon in 1877.  Over the next few years several experiences had a significant impact on Sargent's artistic development: during a trip to Spain in 1879 he copied paintings by Velasquez at the Prado, in 1880 he visited Belgium and Holland, where he copied works by Hals, and in 1881 he met Whistler in Venice.  The scandal engendered by Sargent's daring portrait of Madame Gautreau at the Salon of 1884 precipitated his departure to London the following year.  In 1887 he visited and worked with Monet at Giverny, and made his first professional trip to America.  In 1897 he was elected an academician at the National Academy of Design, New York, and the Royal Academy of Art, London, and he was made a member of the Legion of Honor in France.  By the turn of the century Sargent was recognized as the most acclaimed international society portraitist of the Edwardian era, and his clientele consisted of the most affluent, aristocratic, and fashionable people of his time.  Noted for his dazzling technical virtuosity and painterly technique, he influenced an entire generation of American portraitists.  Sargent resented the limitations of portraiture, however, and from the beginning of his exceptionally successful career took every opportunity to paint a wide range of genre subjects.  Around 1906 he abandoned portraiture and worked primarily in watercolor, a medium in which he was extraordinarily gifted.  Although an expatriate who lived in London, Sargent was commited to America's cultural development and executed important mural decorations for the Boston Public Library (1890-1919), the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (1916-1925), and Harvard University's Widener Library (1921-1922).  He died in London in 1925.  [This is an edited version of the artist's biography published in the NGA Systematic Catalogue]", "article_2": "John Singer Sargent, (born January 12, 1856, Florence, Italy--died April 15, 1925, London, England), Italian-born American painter whose elegant portraits provide an enduring image of Edwardian Age society.  The wealthy and privileged on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean came to his studio in London to be immortalized.  Sargent was reared abroad and first saw the United States in 1876, when he established citizenship.  Serious and reserved, he had a talent for drawing, and in 1874 he went to Paris to study painting with Carolus-Duran, a fashionable society portraitist.  During this time he also began to experiment with the techniques of the Impressionists.  In 1879 Sargent traveled to Madrid to study the works of Diego Velazquez and to Haarlem, Neth. , to see the works of Frans Hals.  Some critics believe that his best work, executed in a rich dark palette, was done in the years immediately after this trip, including a series of paintings depicting the daily labours of the Venetian working class.  Britannica Quiz Ultimate Art Quiz From symbolism to sculpture, this quiz will put you in touch with your artistic side.  At the Salon of 1884, Sargent showed what is probably his best-known picture, Madame X, a portrait of Madame Gautreau, a famous Parisian beauty.  Sargent regarded it as his masterpiece and was disagreeably surprised when it caused a scandal--critics found it eccentric and erotic.  Discouraged by his Parisian failure, Sargent moved permanently to London.  His work was too Continental and avant-garde to appeal immediately to English taste: The Misses Vickers (1884) was voted worst picture of the year by the Pall Mall Gazette in 1886.  It was not until 1887 that this critical reception changed.  That year his Carnation, Lily, Lily, Rose (1885-86), a study of two little girls lighting Japanese lanterns, captured the hearts of the British public, and he began to experience the phenomenal acclaim in England and the United States that he would enjoy for the rest of his life.  Sargents broad, slashing brushstrokes and brilliant palette evoke a sense of the accidental and of capturing a particular moment.  He was surprisingly unrepetitive in his portraiture, responding to each sitter differently, and was masterfully able to manipulate props and painterly effects to suggest the class and sometimes the occupation of his subjects.  His best portraits capture his sitters in a revealing, off-guard moment.  Fashionable clients flocked to his Chelsea studio and paid, on average, 1,000 guineas, or $5,000, for a full-length portrait.  After 1910 Sargent gave up portraiture and devoted the rest of his life to painting murals and Alpine and Italian landscapes in watercolour.  With stenographic brilliance Sargent pursued transparency and fluidity beyond the experiments of J. M. W.  Turner and Winslow Homer, sometimes creating works that were prophetically or accidentally expressionistic, as in Mountain Fire (1895).  From 1890 to 1910 he worked on a commission for the Boston Public Library to execute murals on the history of the Jewish and Christian religions.  He also executed murals in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.

Sargent was born in Florence, Italy to American parents.  Sargent studied in Italy and Germany, and then in Paris under Emile Auguste Carolus-Duran.  Sargent studied with Carolus-Duran, whose influence would be pivotal, from 1874-1878.  Carolus-Duran's atelier was progressive, dispensing with the traditional academic approach which required careful drawing and underpainting, in favor of the alla prima method of working directly on the canvas with a loaded brush, derived from Diego Velazquez.  It was an approach which relied on the proper placement of tones of paint.

Presenting more than 90 of Sargents dazzling works, this exhibition, co-organized with the Brooklyn Museum, combines for the first time the two most significant collections of watercolor paintings by John Singer Sargent (1856-1925), images created by a consummate artist with daring compositional strategies and a complex technique.  \"John Singer Sargent Watercolors\" also celebrates a century of Sargent watercolors at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.  \"John Singer Sargent Watercolors\" offers visitors an unprecedented opportunity to view the magnificent works Sargent produced between 1902 and 1911, when he was at the height of his artistic powers and internationally recognized as the greatest American painter of his age.  His bold and experimental approach to the medium caused a sensation in Britain and great excitement in America.  The Brooklyn and Boston holdings (never before explored in a focused exhibition) were purchased by the two museums straight from Sargents only two American watercolor exhibitions, held at Knoedler Gallery in New York.  (Brooklyn acquired its collection in 1909, and the MFA in 1912. ) These daringly conceived compositions (along with a select group of oils), made in Spain and Portugal, Greece, Switzerland and the Alps, regions of Italy, Syria and Palestine, demonstrate the unity of Sargents artistic vision after the turn of the 20th century, when he sought to liberate himself from the burden of portrait commissions and to devote himself instead to painting scenes of landscape, labor, and leisure.  The exhibition is accompanied by a full-color catalogue exploring Sargents engagement with watercolor painting and examining the technical mastery that led to such brilliant work.

He entered the Paris studio of Carolus-Duran in 1874, where he stayed as student and assistant until 1878.  He visited America in 1876, and the following year exhibited his first at the Paris .  He travelled to Spain and Morocco in 1879-80, and to Haarlem in 1880, where he copied works by Velasquez and Frans Hals.  He lived in Paris until 1884, then settled in London in 1885 following the stormy reception of his Madame Gautreau at the 1884 Paris Salon.  Sargent exhibited at the Royal Academy and the Grosvenor Gallery from 1882, and with the , of which he was a founding member, from 1886.  He held a one-man exhibition at the St Botolph Club, Boston, Massachusetts in 1888.  He exhibited at Knoedler's, New York in 1909 and 1912.  He was made an Associate of the Royal Academy in 1894, and a full member in 1897.  His murals for the Boston Public Library were begun in 1891.  He travelled widely in Europe, and visited the Holy Land in 1905-6.  Sargent's international reputation as a portraitist reached its peak in the 1890s and early 1900s, and he painted many of the distinguished personalities of his day, including the actress Dame Ellen Terry (Tate Gallery N02053), the art dealer Asher Wertheimer and his family (Tate Gallery N03705-13, T07104), Coventry Patmore and Henry James.  Many of his clients were Americans: Roosevelt, Rockefeller, H. G.  Marquand, and Lady Randolph Churchill.  By 1910 he had given up all but the occasional portrait, devoting himself to and the murals at Boston.  His most important war picture, Gassed (1919), is in the Imperial War Museum, London.  A retrospective exhibition was held at the Grand Central Art Galleries, New York, in 1924.  Sargent died in London.  He remained an American citizen throughout his life.  Memorial exhibitions of his work were held in Boston in 1925, and at the Royal Academy, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York and Tate Gallery in 1926.

A prolific artist, he produced around 900 oil paintings, over 2,000 watercolors and even more sketches and preliminary studies.  Born in Italy to American parents, Sargent spent his childhood traveling through Europe.  He showed his artistic inclinations at a young age, and in 1874 he began his formal training at the Paris studio of Carolus-Duran .  After leaving the studio in 1878, Sargent concentrated on building his craft, traveling through Europe and methodically studying works of old masters in Holland, Spain, and Venice.  During his travels, he painted many genre scenes, such as Rosina, Capri (1878) and Venetian Bead Stringers (1880-1882).  Sargent also experimented with Impressionist techniques at the influence of Claude Monet , whom he met at the second Impressionist exhibition in 1876.  In Sargents case, the use of the Impressionist technique is noticeable in landscape paintings like Washerwomen (ca.  1880) and Landscape at Broadway (1885).  In the late 1870s and early 1880s, Sargent was building his reputation in Paris.  He received positive critiques for portraits like Portrait of Frances Sherborne Ridley Watts (1877) and subject paintings like El Jaleo (1882).  Sargents career suffered a setback at the 1884 Paris Salon where he exhibited Madame X (1883-1884), the portrait of the young socialite Virginie Amelie Avegno Gautreau.  While the painting received some praise, it was mostly ridiculed and dismissed as a distasteful display of vanity.  Sargent defended his work and refused to take it down even in the face of mounting pressure from Gautreaus mother, who blamed the portrait for ruining her daughters reputation.  Discouraged and humiliated by the scandal, Sargent left Paris and moved to London.  The scandal of Madame X followed Sargent to England: London patrons were wary of Sargents \"French style\" and he struggled to secure commissions.  However, this changed in 1887 when he exhibited the painting Carnation, Lily, Lily, Rose (1885-1886), an image of two children lighting Chinese lanterns at dusk.  The painting dazzled critics and audiences, and Sargent was once again in demand.  He enjoyed an upscale clientele of aristocrats, wealthy businesspeople, artists, and performers from Europe and America.  His international reputation reached its peak in the 1890s and early 1900s.  At that time Sargent painted portraits of distinguished figures like Theodore Roosevelt, actress Dame Ellen Terry and author Henry James.  By 1910 Sargent gave up portraiture and focused his attention on painting murals and landscapes.  One of his significant later works was the war painting Gassed (1919).  The painting was commissioned by the British government who asked Sargent to create a large painting that embodied the idea of Anglo-American cooperation during World War I.  In 1924, Sargents retrospective exhibition was held at the Grand Central Art Galleries in New York.  After the retrospective, the artist returned to London, where he died of heart disease.  Memorial exhibitions were held on both sides of the Atlantic: in Boston, New York, and London in 1925-1926.  John Singer Sargent (/'sa:rdZ@nt/; January 12, 1856 - April 14, 1925) was an American artist, considered the \"leading portrait painter of his generation\" for his evocations of Edwardian era luxury.  During his career, he created roughly 900 oil paintings and more than 2,000 watercolors, as well as countless sketches and charcoal drawings.  His oeuvre documents worldwide travel, from Venice to the Tyrol, Corfu, the Middle East, Montana, Maine, and Florida.  His parents were American, but he was trained in Paris prior to moving to London.  Sargent enjoyed international acclaim as a portrait painter, although not without controversy and some critical reservation; an early submission to the Paris Salon, his Portrait of Madame X, was intended to consolidate his position as a society painter, but it resulted in scandal instead.  From the beginning his work was characterized by remarkable technical facility, particularly in his ability to draw with a brush, which in later years inspired admiration as well as criticism for a supposed superficiality.  His commissioned works were consistent with the grand manner of portraiture, while his informal studies and landscape paintings displayed a familiarity with Impressionism.  In later life Sargent expressed ambivalence about the restrictions of formal portrait work, and devoted much of his energy to mural painting and working en plein air.  He lived most of his life in Europe.  Art historians generally ignored the society artists such as Sargent until the late 20th century.  Before Sargent's birth, his father, FitzWilliam (b.  1820 Gloucester, Massachusetts), was an eye surgeon at the Wills Eye Hospital in Philadelphia 1844-1854.  After John's older sister died at the age of two, his mother, Mary (nee Singer), suffered a breakdown, and the couple decided to go abroad to recover.  They remained nomadic expatriates for the rest of their lives.  Although based in Paris, Sargent's parents moved regularly with the seasons to the sea and the mountain resorts in France, Germany, Italy, and Switzerland.  While Mary was pregnant, they stopped in Florence, Tuscany, because of a cholera epidemic.  Sargent was born there in 1856.  A year later, his sister Mary was born.  After her birth, FitzWilliam reluctantly resigned his post in Philadelphia and accepted his wife's entreaties to remain abroad.  They lived modestly on a small inheritance and savings, living a quiet life with their children.  They generally avoided society and other Americans except for friends in the art world.  Four more children were born abroad, of whom only two lived past childhood.  Although his father was a patient teacher of basic subjects, young Sargent was a rambunctious child, more interested in outdoor activities than his studies.  As his father wrote home, \"He is quite a close observer of animated nature. \" His mother was convinced that traveling around Europe, and visiting museums and churches, would give young Sargent a satisfactory education.  Several attempts to have him formally schooled failed, owing mostly to their itinerant life.  Sargent's mother was a fine amateur artist and his father was a skilled medical illustrator.  Early on, she gave him sketchbooks and encouraged drawing excursions.  Young Sargent worked with care on his drawings, and he enthusiastically copied images from The Illustrated London News of ships and made detailed sketches of landscapes.  FitzWilliam had hoped that his son's interest in ships and the sea might lead him toward a naval career.

Regarded as one of the best-known designers in Britain, Mellor specialised in metalwork and especially cutlery.  He also produced many other designs, including for bus shelters and the traffic light system in use across the United Kingdom, British Crown Dependencies, and British overseas territories. Mellor was born in Ecclesall, Sheffield, where his father was a toolmaker for the Sheffield Twist Drill Company.  From the age of eleven, Mellor attended the Junior Art Department of Sheffield College of Art, receiving an intensive training in craft skills.  He made his first piece of metalwork - a sweet dish - at this early age.  He studied at the Royal College of Art in London from 1950.  Mellor's first cutlery, \"Pride\", designed while he was still a student, is still in production.  Mellor also studied at the British School at Rome. Returning to Sheffield, Mellor set up a silversmithing workshop-studio making one-off pieces of specially commissioned silverware.  His work included a collection of modern silver tableware commissioned by the government for British embassies in a drive to give Britain a more forward-looking image. Alongside silversmithing Mellor was stimulated by the relatively new design potential of stainless steel.  His \"Symbol\" cutlery, manufactured from 1963 at Walker & Hall's purpose-built modern factory at Bolsover in Derbyshire, was the first high-quality stainless steel cutlery to be produced in quantity in the UK.  Mellor was subsequently commissioned by the government to redesign standard issue cutlery for canteens, hospitals, prisons and the railways, reducing the traditional 11-piece place set to five pieces and thereby reducing costs.  The traffic light system Mellor designed for the United Kingdom, Crown Dependencies Isle of Man, The Channel Islands, and British overseas territories, used across the nations since 1965.  Mellor worked for the Midlands engineering firm Abacus Municipal on the design of street lighting, bus shelters, public seating and litter bins.  Around 140,000 of his bus shelters having been installed since they were first produced in 1959.  In 1965 he was commissioned by the Department of the Environment to redesign the national traffic light system as part of an overhaul of traffic signs.  Mellor's redesigned traffic lights are still in use. In 1973 Mellor made the decision to begin manufacturing his own cutlery designs.  To house his factory he renovated a large historic mansion, Broom Hall, in central Sheffield.  The building was then derelict.  The machines were moved into the extensive Georgian wing.  The conversion of the building received a European Architectural Heritage Award.  As well as introducing new concepts in cutlery he rethought the traditional methods of production.  Workers in the Sheffield cutlery industry had up to then specialised in a single operation, but he introduced a new system whereby his cutlery makers rotate from task to task, increasing job satisfaction through a sense of involvement in the project.  In 1990, Mellor finally realised a long-held ambition by commissioning a new purpose-built cutlery factory designed by Michael Hopkins.  This factory, known as the Round Building, was built on the circular foundations of the redundant village gas works at Hathersage in the Peak District National Park, 12 miles from Sheffield. The first David Mellor shop opened at 4 Sloane Square, London, in 1969.  It was followed by shops in James Street, Covent Garden; King Street, Manchester; and 22 Shad Thames, Butlers Wharf, London (since closed).  A shop and a design museum was opened in Hathersage, alongside the Round Building factory in 2006. Mellor was the youngest Royal Designer for Industry, elected in 1962 at the age of 32.  In the early 1980s he chaired the wide-ranging Design Council Committee of Inquiry into standards of design in Consumer Goods in Britain.  He has been Chairman of the Crafts Council and a trustee of the Victoria & Albert Museum.  He was awarded honorary doctorates from the University of Sheffield, De Montfort University, Sheffield Hallam University, Loughborough University and the Royal College of Art.  In 1981 he was appointed OBE and CBE in 2001.  A large-scale retrospective exhibition \"David Mellor Master Metalworker\" was held at the Design Museum, London, in 1996.  There is a David Mellor Design Museum in a building alongside the cutlery factory at Hathersage. Mellor retired from designing in 2005 at the age of 74.  Mellor was married to Fiona MacCarthy, a biographer and cultural historian.  They have two children, Corin (born 1966), product and interior designer, who is Creative Director of David Mellor Design; and Clare, a graphic designer with her own London practice.  Mellor died on 7 May 2009 at the age of 78.

As a member of the Conservative Party, he served in the Cabinet of Prime Minister John Major as Chief Secretary to the Treasury (1990-92) and Secretary of State for National Heritage (April-September 1992), before resigning in 1992.  He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Putney from 1979 to 1997.  Since leaving Parliament, Mellor has worked as a newspaper columnist, a radio presenter, and an after-dinner speaker.  He also served as Chairman of the government's 'Football Task Force'. Born in Wareham, Dorset, Mellor was educated at Swanage Grammar School, and Christ's College, Cambridge, during which time he was Chairman of the Cambridge University Conservative Association and a contestant on University Challenge.  After briefly working for Jeffrey Archer (at the time a Member of Parliament) while studying for his bar exams, Mellor was called to the Bar in 1972.  He ceased to practise in 1979 upon being elected as an MP, and he remains \"non-practising\". [citation needed] He was appointed Queen's Counsel in 1987. After contesting West Bromwich East in the general election in October 1974, Mellor became the MP for Putney in the general election of 1979.  He was re-elected in the general elections of 1983, 1987, and 1992. Mellor was made Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department of Energy in 1981.  In 1983, Mellor was appointed as a minister in the Home Office[full citation needed] where he was involved in several pieces of legislation, including the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 (which established the Crown Prosecution Service).  He was also involved with legislation enabling the re-investigation of miscarriages of justice, and with the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. [citation needed] In 1987, Mellor was moved to the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office by Thatcher, and was made responsible for the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and the Soviet Union (before the revolutions of 1989). [citation needed] At this point he made an extended appearance on the Channel 4 discussion programme After Dark speaking about the Mafia.  Mellor was briefly Secretary of State for Health and Social Care in 1988, where he was responsible for health service reforms.  He was made a Privy Councillor in 1990 by Thatcher, shortly before she resigned as Prime Minister. [citation needed] Mellor was briefly Minister for the Arts in 1990 before entering John Major's new Cabinet as Chief Secretary to the Treasury in November of that year.  He was interviewed in December 1991 on the TV programmne Hard News following the establishment of the Calcutt Review inquiring into Press Standards.  Mellor said during the interview that \"the press - the popular press - is drinking in the last chance saloon\" and called for curbs on the \"sacred cow\" of press freedom to curb their more extreme activities. Following the 1992 United Kingdom general election Mellor remained a Cabinet Minister as Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport in the newly created Department of National Heritage (now the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport), during which period he was occasionally referred to as the \"Minister for Fun\" after comments he made to the waiting press on leaving 10 Downing Street on his appointment. Retaliation from the media for his \"last chance saloon\" comment came in July 1992, when Mellor's former mistress, actress Antonia de Sancha, sold her \"kiss and tell\" story of Mellor's extra-marital affair with her for PS35,000.  Their telephone conversations had been secretly recorded by de Sancha's landlord, an activity which at the time was legal in England. The Sun, relying on material supplied by the publicist Max Clifford, made a number of untrue claims about the relationship, that de Sancha later admitted. This was subsequently confirmed by David Mellor in 2011 at the Leveson Inquiry into Press Behaviour. The Prime Minister John Major supported Mellor, but the media maintained their interest.  A libel case brought by Mona Bauwens against The People, which came to the High Court in September 1992, led to the revelation that Mellor had accepted the gift of a month-long holiday in Marbella from Bauwens for his family which took place in August 1990. Mellor's connection to Bauwens, the daughter of Jaweed al-Ghussein, the finance director of the PLO (formally the Palestine National Fund) maintained the pressure on him.  Mellor resigned on 24 September 1992. Mellor contested the 1997 general election, but was defeated by the Labour Party's Tony Colman as one of the most notable Tory casualties as Labour won by a landslide to end nearly 20 years of Conservative government.  The election night was memorable for Mellor's showdown with the Referendum Party founder Sir James Goldsmith -- Mellor was taunted by Goldsmith and Michael Yardley, the Spokesperson for the Sportsman's Alliance (who gave him a slow hand clap and shouted \"Out! Out! Out!\") during Mellor's concession speech.  Mellor retorted: . . .  and Sir James. . .  has got nothing to be smug about, and I would like to say that 1,500 votes is a derisory total.  We have shown tonight that the Referendum Party is dead in the water, and Sir James can get off back to Mexico knowing your attempt to buy the British political system has failed! Goldsmith would die from pancreatic cancer two months later on 18 July 1997. Mellor was chairman of the incoming Labour government's 'Football Task Force' from August 1997 until its dissolution in 1999.  Among the recommendations accepted by the Labour government and introduced into law was the criminalisation of racial abuse by an individual spectator, as distinct from a group.  Mellor has also pursued a career in journalism, and has written columns for six national newspapers including the Evening Standard, The Guardian and The People, often on current affairs, but also his specialist interests of sport and the arts.  He regularly presented football-related programmes on BBC Radio 5 until 2001, and classical music programmes on BBC Radio 2 and BBC Radio 3 for six years.  Since 2000, Mellor has also been a radio presenter at Classic FM (UK). He is Opera and Classical Music critic for British newspaper The Mail on Sunday.  He is a regular contributor to the radio station LBC, on which he previously co-hosted a Saturday morning politics and current affairs discussion programme for eight years with former London Mayor Ken Livingstone.  This continued until 2016, when Livingstone was sacked and Mellor's contract was not renewed. In June 2010, it was reported in The Daily Telegraph and the Daily Mirror that Mellor called a chef a \"fat bastard\" during a licensing wrangle at the River Lounge restaurant near his home at St Katharine Docks, East London.  The articles claimed Mellor used bad language and told the chef he should \"do his PS10-an-hour job somewhere else\".  In November 2014 The Daily Telegraph and The Independent reported that Mellor had been secretly recorded by a taxi driver, saying \"you think that your experiences are anything compared to mine?\" In the secret recording of an encounter on 21 November, Mellor and the cab driver argue over which is the better route to their destination.  The article alleged that he swore at the driver.  Mellor later told the media that he regretted losing his temper but blamed the driver for provoking him. Mellor married Judith Hall in Worthing on 20 July 1974.  The couple had two sons before divorcing in 1995. Mellor currently lives with his partner, Penelope Lyttelton, Viscountess Cobham.", "article_2": "1992: Mellor resigns over sex scandal David Mellor has resigned as heritage minister, blaming his departure on a constant barrage of hostile stories in the tabloid press.  In a letter to the prime minister he said he had become a burden to his colleagues and a point of weakness in the government, leaving him with no option to resign.  Mr Mellor's decision comes despite saying in an interview two days ago he would fight on.  He also said John Major and not the tabloid editors should decide his fate.  There have been a constant stream of stories about the married MP in the press since the July disclosure of his affair with the actress Antonia de Sancha.  Embarrasment Mr Mellor handed his letter of resignation to the prime minister at 1600 BST, after informing him of his decision before this morning's cabinet meeting.  Mr Major's response said he admired the courage of his colleague and only accepted the resignation with deep regret.  But Mr Mellor was reportedly told last night he was becoming an embarrassment to Mr Major in a phone call from Sir Marcus Fox - chairman of the influential backbench 1922 Committee.  The revelations about the heritage secretary's personal life were followed with allegations about his business and social connections.  In the past three weeks there have been newspaper reports about a free holiday in August 1990 as the guest of a Palestinian Liberation Official's daughter and another paid for by the ruler of Abu Dhabi.  But tabloid editors have rejected Mr Mellor's claim he was hounded out of office.  Bill Hagerty, editor of the People said: \"This is the first time in ages that David Mellor has done the decent thing.  \"We published the details of his affair with Antonia de Sancha because I felt it was in the public interest. \"", "article_3": "From 9pm on a Saturday evening, David presents a specially curated selection of music perfect for weekend listening, including personal favourites, exciting new releases and rediscovered gems from his musical archive.

Ask David Mellor a question about any type of classical music from the last 100 years, and you can be pretty sure hell have a fact about it tripping off his tongue before youve finished speaking.  His knowledge of the repertoire really is remarkable - and, as youll discover if you join him this weekend, Davids lightness of touch and enthusiasm for everything he plays marks his programme out as one of the most accessible on the entire station.  Each Saturday, David chooses a different, intriguing theme and uses it to weave all sorts of anecdotes and fascinating asides into the music hes playing.  One week, the programme will be a celebration of American classical music to mark Independence Day; the next, hes paying tribute to great singers of the 20th century like Kathleen Ferrier and Joan Sutherland by featuring some of the finest recordings from the archive.  Davids selections are always eclectic - but always inclusive, too.  We exhort him to quite deliberately play music which doesnt feature elsewhere on the station; after all, Saturday evenings are usually a time when you can listen to the radio quite actively, and really lend us your ears.  The visitors have gone, the shoppings been done, and its just you, Classic FM and some great music (plus potentially a rather large pile of ironing to tackle before the morning).  David therefore takes the opportunity to tell a few stories about the music hes playing, and to treat you to pieces that wouldnt always fit so nearly at other times of the day.  David is always delighted to receive your thoughts on the music he plays - especially if theres a theme you think would work well on a Saturday night.  Let him know your thoughts via the form below or tweet @ClassicFM, and listen this Saturday evening for a wonderfully indulgent and enjoyable journey of discovery on Classic FM. "}}

He served as the eighth Premier of Western Australia from 1906 to 1910 and, following service in the First World War, was a member of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom from 1918 to 1932.  He was the father of Sir Rodney Moore. Captain Newton Moore, Bunbury Rifle Volunteers, 1900 Newton Moore was born in Fremantle, Western Australia, son of James Moore, auctioneer and later mayor of Bunbury, and Elizabeth Dawson, schoolteacher.  He was educated at Arthur Street Primary School in Bunbury before attending Prince Alfred College in Adelaide, South Australia.  In 1886, he was apprenticed as a surveyor to Alexander Forrest.  After qualifying in 1894, he worked as a contract surveyor in and around the Bunbury area.  In April 1898 he married Isabella Lowrie, sister of William Lowrie.  In 1899 Moore was elected to the Bunbury Municipal Council, and was Mayor of Bunbury from 1900 to 1904.  In 1903 he was also a member of the Royal Commission on Forestry, and during 1904 and 1905 he was President of the Municipal Association of Western Australia.  Moore was also involved in the Western Australian militia, commencing a long career as a private with the BRV (Bunbury Rifle Volunteers) in 1894.  By 1900 he had risen to captain and was instrumental in assisting in the formation of the BRV Mounted Infantry Section, which was later incorporated into the WAMI (Western Australian Mounted Infantry).  After the Commonwealth reorganisation of 1903, the unit was renamed the 18th (WAMI) Australian Light Horse.  Moore served as acting commander until 1908, when he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and officially appointed the commanding officer.  In August 1908, Moore was appointed commanding officer of the 5th Military District Intelligence Section, where he remained until March 1914. In 1901, Moore contested the Western Australian Legislative Assembly seat of Bunbury, but was unsuccessful.  In 1904 he contested the seat again and won.  In August 1905, he was appointed Minister for Lands and Agriculture in Cornthwaite Rason's government.  On Rason's resignation on 7 May 1906, he became Premier of Western Australia.  At 36 years old, he was at the time the youngest ever premier.  He remains the most inexperienced politician ever to hold the office, having served in parliament for less than two years at the time of his appointment.  Moore's emphasis as Premier was on agricultural development.  He personally retained the Lands and Agriculture portfolio, and pursued a policy of cheap land for settlers.  His government laid the foundations of the Wheatbelt, and brought the state into line with the rest of Australia through an Income and Land tax, despite opposition from the conservative Legislative Council.  In September 1907, after a dispute with the Legislative Council, Moore resigned as premier.  However, Governor Bedford would not accept his resignation, nor would he consent to an early dissolution, so Moore resumed office.  In 1908, Moore led the Liberal Party to another election victory.  As the state had previously seen nine Premiers in a little over five years, this was a welcome respite from a period of great instability.  Moore was Minister for Justice from 14 May 1909 until 30 June 1909, when he relinquished both the Agriculture and Lands portfolio and the Justice portfolio, and took up the office of Colonial Treasurer.  On 16 September 1910, Moore resigned as Premier and Colonial Treasurer on the grounds of ill health. Moore was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in June 1908, and knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in June 1910.  In February 1911, he resigned his Bunbury seat to take up the office of Agent-General for Western Australia in London.  In 1915, while still Agent-General, the Australian government appointed him General Officer Commanding Australian Imperial Forces in the United Kingdom.  He held that position until 1917, during which time he was promoted to the rank of major general. In 1918, Moore resigned as Agent-General after being invited by the Conservative Party to stand for the British House of Commons seat of St George's, Hanover Square, which had been made vacant by the death of former Prime Minister of Australia George Reid.  He was elected to the seat on 4 October 1918.  In the 1918 general election on 14 December he instead stood for and won the seat of Islington North.  After a break from politics in 1923 and 1924, he won the seat of Richmond upon Thames in the general election of 29 October 1924, and held it until his resignation on 13 April 1932.  For ten years, he was Chairman of the Standing Orders Committee of the House of Commons.  He established himself as an excellent representative of Australia, and his opinion on Empire matters was highly valued by British ministers.  After retiring from politics, Moore became President of the British Empire Steel Corporation, a company with interests in Western Australia and Canada.  He was also a director of several important companies.  He died on 28 October 1936 at a nursing home in London, following surgery.  Newton Moore Senior High School in Bunbury is named after him.", "article_1": "School in Australia Newton Moore Senior High School is a comprehensive independent public co-educational high day school, located in South Bunbury, a suburb of Bunbury, 175 kilometres (109 mi) south of Perth, Western Australia. The school was established in 1966 and by 2012 had an enrolment of 611 students between Year 8 and Year 12, approximately 14% of whom were Indigenous Australians.  The school was opened in 1966 to cater for the rising population of Bunbury and the lack of available space around Bunbury Senior High School.  The school is named after the eighth Premier of Western Australia, Sir Newton James Moore.  A longstanding competitor in the High School Country Week tournament, the school won the champion school award in 1991, 1992, 2005 and 2006.

Born in San Salvatore Monferrato, his military career was cut short by ill health, and in 1865 he settled in Milan.  Here he entered literary study, becoming part of the Scapigliatura, a literary movement animated by a spirit of rebellion against traditional culture.  He worked on several newspapers and published a torrent of short stories, novels, and poems. He contracted tuberculosis and died in poverty at the age of 29.  Tarchetti published his plagiarized translation of \"The Mortal Immortal\" (1833) by Mary Shelley as \"The Elixir of Immortality\", with small but significant changes but without attribution.  He also appropriated foreign texts in the Gothic tradition, such as works by E.  T.  A.  Hoffmann, Edgar Allan Poe and Theophile Gautier. Lawrence Venuti, who discovered the antecedents of \"Mortal Immortal\" while translating Tarchetti's Fantastic Tales, considers his appropriation as serving the social agenda of Scapigliatura.  Fantastic Tales was the first ever translation of Tarchetti into English. Fosca, written in 1869, was the basis for Ettore Scola's 1981 film, Passione d'amore, which in turn served as the basis for James Lapine and Stephen Sondheim's 1994 musical Passion.", "article_1": "Come here for a different spread of horror and fantastical stories to what you've found anthologised countless times before.

The first work, as was too often the norm in the 1860s when this was written, takes an inordinate amount of waffle to be endured before we crack on with the story, a mystical visit to a world of either dream or nightmarish past lives.  What comes next was much more snappy - almost too brief, indeed - and was an amusing vignette about a poor man who is the village's worst violinist.  'A Spirit in a Raspberry' has exactly that - but it's actually a wonderful look at possession, and a baron forced to discover the woman within him.  'Bouvard' gave me a strong sense of deja vu, although that may have come not from me reading it before, but from the fact that what it does in struggling for something profound over forty pages, Poe could do in three.  While rhyming.  Concerning the second half, we have a fine short chiller from the world of the seance, in contrast to 'The Lake of the Three Lampreys', which is equally good but with what is a very traditional folk tale mood.  Next we see the results of drinking the alchemist's latest potion, but the story brings a frisson of love to things - and not for the only time in these pages - which shows this author, I think, to be quite a human and humane one, and one capable of having much more in the way of character for his narrators than the usual redoubtable young man or fusty old academic.  That said, the madman narrator is also rather more familiar than he might be - yet the reason for the instance of it in the next piece is really quite fun and different.  Or plain silly, if you're less charitable.  And we close with one of this book's longer, more flowery instances of dark drama, but to these eyes the one that seemed the most original.  What would be worse, after all, than one person who spreads misfortune and death wherever they go? Why, two of them, of course.  So there you have it, nine pieces in this selection.  I see other editions have only had five contents, but there is not much here you could call disposable filler - if this is how it was presented in Italian in the 1860s they were on to a winner.  I would wish for a brief introduction to the author, for my digital copy at least came with no information or education about him.  He deserves at least that on this evidence.  Genre fans I think would really appreciate the chance to discover these lost pieces.  While 'Bouvard' and a beat here and a beat there were a little old-fashioned for my tastes, this as a whole was well worth a strong set of four shiny ones.

\"Scapigliatura\" refers to an interdisciplinary art movement born in Milan in the post-Risorgimento period.  The word itself (translated into English as \"dishevelment\" but perhaps closer in meaning to \"bohemianism\") was first defined in an 1862 novel written by Cletto Arrighi (1828-1906) titled La Scapigliatura e il 6 febbraio.  The novel recounts the story of a failed Milanese revolt against Austrian oppression in 1853.  Among the traits of a scapigliato as defined by Arrighi, are \". . . revolt and opposition to all established order. \" He goes on to elaborate upon the subtleties of Scapigliatura thinking stressing that \". . . hope is its religion; pride its uniform, poverty its essential character. \" Arrighis description put into place most of the ideas central to Scapigliatura comportment: individualism, bohemianism, anti-authoritarianism, and revolutionary zeal contained within a personality of excessive and anarchic behavior.  Most members of Scapigliatura died young, many taking their own lives, while others fell prey to poor health, bad luck, and poverty.  Among the most important members of the movement, in addition to Arrighi, were the writers Giovanni Rovani (1818-1874), Emilio Praga (1839-1875), and Iginio Ugo Tarchetti (1841-1869); the poet/composer Arrigo Boito (1842-1918) and his architect brother Camillo (1836-1914); the painters Tranquillo Cremona (1837-1878) and Daniele Ranzoni; and the sculptor Giuseppe Grandi (1843-1894).  Iginio Ugo Tarchetti (the pseudonym of Igino Pietro Teodoro Tarchetti, (1) born San Salvatore Monferrato 1839, died Milan 1869) was a seminal literary figure in Scapigliatura.  A poet, novelist, journalist, and translator, he was among the first in the group open to the foreign influences of writers like E. T. A.  Hoffmann (1776-1822), Mary Shelley (1797-1851), Edgar Allan Poe (1809-1849), and Charles Baudelaire (1821-1867).  The two sonnets that appear below bear the same title, Nel di dei morti, and were published in a posthumous collection of Tarchettis poetry titled Disjecta: Versi, (Fragments), (Zanichelli, Bologna, 1879).  The sonnets first appeared in November 1867, in the magazine L'Illustrazione universale (IV, 213, 28 novembre 1867).  They appeared again in the journal Il Presagio: Strenna del 1868 (Bonta and Co. , Milan, 1868).  It was in this latter publication that a place and date for the compositions were cited: \"Milan, November 1, 1867. \" The sonnets were written on All Saints Day, preceding the commemoration of the dead on the day to follow, November 2 or All Souls Day.  Space in this brief essay does not allow for an extensive analysis of the influences and imagery in these two important poems by Tarchetti.  In both, the poet has entered a landscape of the dead - the cemetery where his fathers tomb is located.  It is a mild autumn day, a lovely day in fact, were it not for the dark ruminations upon which the poet fixates.  Slowly, as in the stories and poems of Poe, a malaise is felt.  The poets meditations dwell upon burial itself, the eternal silence of the dead, and thoughts on the chronic unhappiness that had characterized his fathers life.  Such macabre themes were an integral part of both Tarchettis writings specifically, and Scapigliatura thinking generally.  The second sonnet stresses and explores many of the same themes and motifs as the first, heightening the emotional impact in places.  It becomes a dialogue between the poet and his deceased father.  While no response is forthcoming from the grave, through the poets act of remembrance, embodied in the last rays of the setting sun and the smile of nature, solace and comfort may still be possible for those who remain.  Many of the Gothic elements present in these two poems would be expanded upon in Tarchettis more famous collection of short stories Racconti fantastici (1869) (his first work translated into English) and his novels Paolina (1865) and Fosca (1869).  Like so many of his Scapigliatura friends and colleagues, Tarchettis life ended prematurely.  He died of tuberculosis at the age of 29 in 1869.  His imaginative works, however, would go on to influence such 20th century Italian writers as Dino Buzzati (1906-1972) and Italo Calvino (1923-1985).  (1) Tarchettis baptismal certificate indicates that Igino Pietro Teodoro Tarchetti was born on June 29, 1839, in San Salvatore Monferrato, a village in the Piedmont.  The confusion over his name started in infancy: on the certificate, \"Igino\" is scrawled in to correct the form \"Iginio,\" which had been written first.  Tarchetti later preferred the error, \"Iginio,\" to grace his letters and publications.  (See: L.  Venuti, \"The Hyenas Laugh: I. U.  Tarchetti and the Birth of Italian Gothic,\" Los Angeles Review of Books, December 4, 2020.  www. lareviewofbooks. org/article/the-hyenas-laugh-i-u-tarchetti-and-the-birth-of-italian-gothic/", "article_4": "As if I didnt have enough to do, a new series: The Uncanny in Translation! Regular readers of this blog might have noticed that I have an interest in non-Anglophone weird fiction.  In this series, I plan to share interesting works in translation that I come across, which are possibly less well-known to English language readers.  First up: Fantastic Tales (Racconti Fantastici), by nineteeth century Italian author Iginio Ugo Tarchetti (1839 - 1869), translated by Lawrence Venuti.  According to the book cover, Tarchetti was \"the first Italian writer to experiment with the gothic style,\" and is \"often compared to Edgar Allan Poe. \" He was part of the Scapigliatura movement in Italian literature, a sort of anti-bourgeois, anti-establishment movement influenced by German Romanticism, French bohemians, Baudelaire -- and Poe.  While a comparison to Poe is almost inevitable for any author of gothic sensibilities, he wasnt the first author I thought of when reading Tarchetti.  Maybe its because I read them so recently, but I thought Tarchettis stories were more akin to the stories in Tales of the Dead and Evening Tales for the Winter.  That is, I think of Tarchetti as having been influenced more directly by the British and European authors who also influenced Poe.  The most extreme example of this is \"The Elixir of Immortality (In Imitation of the English). \" Not just an imitation! Its actually a \"plaigiarized translation\" of Mary Shelleys \"The Mortal Immortal,\" first published in The Keepsake for 1834.  As my Dark Tales Sleuth project has showed me, it was unfortunately common in the nineteenth century for translators to not attribute a work, or even to pass it off as their own.  So Tarchetti was not unique.  But I still think Venutis New York Times article about it was a little too kind to him.  Overall, though, I enjoyed Fantastic Tales.  The stories varied from the overtly gothic, to more folkloric and fairy-taleish offerings, with some interesting surreal pieces between.  On the gothic end, we have \"The Legends of the Black Castle,\" which I think would have been quite at home in the Gespensterbuch, or any of the similar German ghost story collections of the early nineteenth century.  On the other end, we have my favorite story in the collection: the delightful gender-bending crime story/fairy tale \"A Spirit in a Raspberry. \" Also on the folkloric end is \"The Lake of the Three Lampreys (A Popular Tradition),\" a charming piece that reminded me of Tarchettis Spanish contemporary Gustavo Bequer.  I dont think there is any direct influence though; Bequer has always struck me as a conservative writer; a good Catholic.  Tarchettis tale, while religious, is also anti-clerical, in the understated way that many folktales are.  \"Captain Gubarts Fortune\" is a fairy-taleish but nonsupernatural tale; \"A Dead Mans Bone\" is reminiscent of a humorous English ghost story.  Both were enjoyable, fun reads.  \"The Fated\" is an intriguing tale about malign influences that definitely reminds me of something, though I cant put my finger on what; E. T. A.  Hoffman, maybe? \"The Letter U (A Madmans Manuscript)\" feels like something Horacio Quiroga would have written.  And Quiroga, of course, greatly admired Poe.  so in a way, theres a Poe connection, after all.  The only story I didnt fully enjoy was \"Bouvard,\" a more philosophical, and rather angsty piece (think The Sorrows of Young Werther).  The story had some lovely passages, but I found that it kind of dragged, and frankly, was a bit too misogynistic.  Still, eight out of nine stories is a good hit rate for a collection.  Im sure that a reader of more wideranging and less haphazard reading habits than mine would situate Tarchettis work differently than I just did (and probably more accurately).  Still, I hope Ive gotten my impressions of him across.  If you like gothic literature and nineteenth-century tales of the uncanny, you will probably enjoy Tarchettis Fantastic Tales.  Recommended.

In this Spanish name , the first or paternal surname isand the second or maternal family name is Juan Carlos Garrido Fernandez (born 29 March 1969) is a Spanish football manager.  He managed Villarreal and Betis in La Liga before working for several years in the Arab world, winning the CAF Confederation Cup with Al Ahly and Raja CA. Born in Valencia, Garrido started managing at only 24, his first club being local amateurs El Puig Club de Futbol.  In the 1998-99 season he coached CD Onda in Tercera Division as the side was Villarreal CF's farm team, a club to which he would be closely associated in the following years.  In 2003, Garrido led the reserves- Onda was now an independent team - to a fourth-division promotion, then was in charge of them for a couple of months in 2004 also in that tier.  In October 2004, he was again named manager of the B side in the place of Jose del Solar, and narrowly missed out another promotion after finishing fifth.  After the appointment of Luis Garcia as manager in May 2005, Garrido returned to his previous duties in the backroom staff. On 18 January 2008, he replaced sacked Juan Carlos Oliva at the helm of Villarreal B, eventually leading them to the 11th position in Segunda Division B and achieving a first-ever Segunda Division promotion the following campaign. On 1 February 2010, Garrido was appointed first-team manager following the dismissal of Ernesto Valverde after a 0-2 home loss against CA Osasuna. On 26 April, before the season in La Liga was over, he was handed a contract set to expire in June 2011; the side finished in seventh position but, after RCD Mallorca were deemed ineligible for participation in the UEFA Europa League by UEFA due to financial irregularities, the Valencians took their place. In his first full season, Garrido led the club to the fourth place in the league, with the subsequent qualification to the UEFA Champions League. The team also reached the semi-finals in the Europa League, being ousted by eventual winners FC Porto. Garrido and Villarreal could not manage one single point in the Champions League in 2011-12, and the latter ranked dangerously close to the relegation zone in the league in that period. On 21 December 2011, following a 0-2 home loss against CD Mirandes in the round of 32 of the Copa del Rey (1-3 on aggregate), he was sacked. On 15 November 2012, Garrido replaced fired Georges Leekens at Club Brugge KV. He was relieved of his duties in September of the following year, replacing fired Pepe Mel at the helm of Real Betis two months later; on 19 January 2014, after only nine official matches and only one win, he was himself sacked after three consecutive defeats - the last one in the league 5-0 at home to Real Madrid - and with the Andalusians finishing dead last. On 8 July 2014, Garrido was appointed at Al Ahly SC in the Egyptian Premier League.  Late into the month, he led his new team to a 1-0 win against Sewe FC for the CAF Confederation Cup which the club eventually won, also conquering the Egyptian Super Cup; on 3 May 2015, however, he was dismissed. On 6 November 2016, Garrido was appointed manager of Ettifaq FC in the Saudi Professional League, signing a seven-month deal with an option for another season according to result and team performance. He was relieved of his duties the following February, with the side in eighth place after 22 matches. Garrido switched clubs and countries again in June 2017, joining Raja CA from Morocco. His first game in charge of the latter took place on 10 September, in a 1-1 away draw against Olympique Club de Khouribga. He won the year's Throne Cup with a penalty shootout victory over Difaa Hassani El Jadidi on 18 November, and a year later the CAF Confederation Cup with a 4-3 aggregate win over AS Vita Club from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. A month after being sacked by Raja, in February 2019 Garrido replaced Zoran Mamic at UAE Pro League club Al Ain FC for the rest of the season. At its closure, he was succeeded by another Croat, Ivan Leko. Garrido was hired by Tunisia's Etoile Sportive du Sahel on 20 November 2019, on a deal until June 2021. Less than three months later, however, he was dismissed due to poor results. On 25 February 2020, Garrido returned to Casablanca, joining Raja's rivals Wydad AC. He was fired in September despite taking the team to the Champions League semi-finals, as they were trailing Raja by four points on the domestic front. Garrido returned to Spain on 12 January 2021 after nearly seven years, being appointed manager of CD Castellon in the second division. He was dismissed on 21 May, as the club faced relegation with two games remaining. As of 20 May 2021 Honours  Al Ahly Raja Casablanca", "article_1": "Its not been all great news for ex-Villarreal managers this month.  Javi Calleja has done very well (and I think all Villarreal fans are pleased for him), taking over an Alaves squad that looked doomed and leading them to safety.  In fact, if they defeat Sevilla on Sunday, theyll end up tied on points with Paco Lopezs Levante.  But while Calleja has prospered, Juan Carlos Garrido, who took over Segunda club Castellon, has not.  He took over for Oscar Cano in mid-January and, while after winning his first match the team dropped four in a row, the club went 5-2-2 in the mid-February to mid-April period, and it seemed they would be able to survive for another year.  But since then, they have lost their last three matches, havent won in five, and have scored only one goal in 450 minutes of football.  So, Castellon now find themselves three points away from safety with two matches left in the regular season, and the board has fired Garrido.  This is clearly a desperation move, with Castellons next match against a Rayo Vallecano side that is trying to make it into the promotion playoffs.  The fundamental problem is that Castellons squad is, even by Segunda standards, just not very good, especially when it comes to putting the ball in the net.  The only thing that might save them is their last match is against Malaga, a team that won two matches in early April to get to 48 points and then said \"You know what? Im done here. \" As for Garrido, hes bounced around from place to place after Villarreal fired him in December 2011; hes spent more than a season with only one club, Raja Casablanca, and even that was only 18 months.  This was his first venture into Spanish coaching since his ill-fated 10-game stint with Real Betis in the 2013-14 season.  He finishes with 6 wins, 4 draws, and 9 defeats.

In this Spanish name , the first or paternal surname isand the second or maternal family name is Aitor Karanka de la Hoz ( Basque and Spanish pronunciation: [aj'tor ka'raNGka]; born 18 September 1973) is a Spanish football manager and former player who is currently the head coach of Segunda Division club Granada.  Save for a brief spell in the United States at age 32, Karanka played solely in Spain for Athletic Bilbao and Real Madrid, appearing in 275 La Liga matches over 13 seasons and winning six honours with the latter.  Karanka started his managerial career in the late 2000s, working as assistant manager at Real Madrid during Jose Mourinho's tenure as manager from 2010 to 2013. He was appointed manager of EFL Championship club Middlesbrough in 2013, guiding them to promotion to the Premier League in 2016 before being dismissed the following year.  He became Nottingham Forest manager in January 2018, leaving the role just over a year later in 2019.  He was appointed as head coach of another Championship club, Birmingham City, in July 2020 and stepped down in March 2021. Athletic / Real Madrid  Born in Vitoria-Gasteiz, Alava, Karanka played as a youth with hometown club Deportivo Alaves and finished his formation with Basque neighbours Athletic Bilbao.  He made his senior debut with the reserves of the latter in 1992, competing in the Segunda Division.  Karanka was promoted to the main squad by Jupp Heynckes in 1993 following the departure of Rafael Alkorta.  He made his La Liga debut on 7 November in a 1-1 away draw against Celta de Vigo (90 minutes played), going on to feature in exactly 100 league matches in his three full seasons before joining the German coach at Real Madrid in 1997 (replacing Alkorta, who had just rejoined Athletic Bilbao). Karanka was used mostly as a backup with the capital-based team but appeared in 33 UEFA Champions League matches for them, including the final of the 1999-2000 edition against Valencia CF (3-0 win). He missed the vast majority of the 1998-99 campaign due to a heart condition. Karanka training with Athletic in December 2003.  For 2002-03, Karanka returned to Athletic Bilbao on a three-year contract with a EUR40 million buyout clause. He helped the Lions qualify for the UEFA Cup in his second year after finishing in fifth place in the league.  In 2006, Karanka joined Major League Soccer (MLS) club Colorado Rapids in the United States. In his only season in MLS, he helped Colorado to the Western Conference play-off final, despite having his attempt saved by Dario Sala in the penalty shootout victory over FC Dallas in the semi-finals. Karanka only played once for Spain at senior level, on 26 April 1995 against Armenia in Yerevan (2-0 win) for the UEFA Euro 1996 qualifiers. He made 14 appearances for the under-21s and was a member of the team that finished runners-up at the 1996 European Championship in a final lost to Italy. Karanka also represented the nation in the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, playing in four matches in an eventual quarter-final exit. Karanka's first role in management was with the Spanish under-16s national team. [citation needed] In June 2010, Karanka was appointed assistant manager at former side Real Madrid by newly appointed manager Jose Mourinho. Three years later, he left the club following the arrival of Carlo Ancelotti, who brought his own coaching staff. On 13 November 2013, Karanka was appointed manager of Championship club Middlesbrough, replacing Tony Mowbray. His first match in charge ended in a 1-2 away defeat against Leeds United, ten days later. On 25 April 2015, in the club's penultimate game of the season away to Fulham, Karanka sent goalkeeper Dimitrios Konstantopoulos forward for an added-time corner kick with the score 3-3.  With the goalkeeper out of position, the opponents scored a winner through Ross McCormack, which sent Watford into the Premier League and jeopardised Middlesbrough's own chances of promotion. He did qualify his team to the play-off final after a 5-1 aggregate win over Brentford, but they lost the decisive match 0-2 to Norwich City at Wembley Stadium. On 7 August 2015, Karanka signed a new four-year contract. Boro were consistently in high positions during the campaign, but on 11 March 2016 he unexpectedly left the training ground after an argument and considered his future at the club.  Responsibilities for the subsequent match, at Charlton Athletic, were handed to his assistant Steve Agnew, but the Spaniard returned to lead the team to the top division after a seven-year absence, as league runners-up. In 2016-17, Karanka led Middlesbrough to the last eight of the FA Cup, where they were eliminated by Manchester City.  He was sacked on 16 March 2017 with the team three points from top-flight safety and without a league win in the new year (while their defence was the fifth best in the division, their attack was the worst with just 19 goals from 27 matches, and he had disagreements with players, fans and the board). Club and manager parted ways by mutual consent, as the latter believed he could take the team no further. On 8 January 2018, Karanka returned to the Championship after being appointed as manager of Nottingham Forest. He replaced Gary Brazil, who had been acting as caretaker manager following the dismissal of Mark Warburton on 31 December 2017, who had in turn left the side sitting 14th in the league. His first match in charge saw Forest suffer a 1-0 defeat to Aston Villa, just days after his appointment. Karanka met his former club Middlesbrough for the first time on 7 April, where Forest were defeated 2-0. During his first summer transfer window in charge, prior to his first full season as manager, Forest signed Joao Carvalho from Benfica for PS13. 2 million, the club's most expensive transfer acquisition. Forest began the season very well, which originally saw them establish a five-match undefeated run. They continued their positive form up until December, where they only won one out of six matches during the final month of the year, which would ultimately cost Karanka his position. On 11 January 2019, he departed the City Ground after requesting to be released from his contract.  He left the team in seventh position, four points behind the play-off places. A key reason behind Karanka's departure was the breakdown in relationship between him and Forest's Chief Executive, Ioannis Vrentzos.  Forest's ambitious board were dissatisfied with Forest's play-off challenge and felt that the club should have been challenging for the automatic promotion places. On 31 July 2020, after 18 months away from management, Karanka was appointed head coach of EFL Championship club Birmingham City on a three-year contract. On 16 March 2021, the club confirmed that he had stepped down from his role after a run of just three wins in 19 matches left the team just outside the relegation zone.  Former Charlton Athletic manager Lee Bowyer was announced as his successor shortly afterwards. In May 2021, Karanka organised an online coaching conference in association with the Royal Spanish Football Federation, under the name AK Coaches' World.  The event focused on women's football, and participants included Ronaldo Nazario, Julen Lopetegui, Monchi, Iraia Iturregi, Jorge Vilda and Mila Martinez. Following a 4-1 defeat at home to Levante on 17 April 2022, Granada dismissed interim head coach Ruben Torrecilla and appointed Karanka as his replacement, tasked with using the remaining six matches to avoid relegation from La Liga. He made his debut on 20 April, securing a goalless draw at reigning champions Atletico Madrid, and won two of the remaining fixtures, but a final-day draw against Espanyol was not enough to secure safety. Karanka was confirmed as the club's head coach for the coming season. Karanka's younger brother, David, is also a former footballer.  A striker, he also appeared for Athletic Bilbao's first team but with much less impact, going on to spend the vast majority of his professional career in the second level or the lower leagues.

This year they shocked Spain by suffering relegation on the final day of the season.  It was Aitor Karanka who was in charge that day, but many thought that perhaps if he had been on the touchline sooner, Granada might have stayed up.  Next season, Karanka will have the chance to take them back to La Liga.  It was announced on Tuesday evening that the former Real Madrid Assistant Manager would be continuing with Los Nazaries next season via the official website.

It wasnt sufficient to keep them up however, as a late missed penalty on the final day of the season condemned Granada to a 0-0 draw with Espanyol and relegation by one point.  The consensus was that Karanka did a good job in his short spell.  His job next season will be a vastly different proposition and most likely with a vastly different squad at his disposal.  He does however have experience of doing so, having won promotion with Middlesbrough in 2016. ", "article_2": "Manager Bio Aitor Karanka made his Premier League bow in 2016/17 after guiding Middlesbrough back to the top flight to end a seven-year absence.  Apart from one sole year at Colorado Rapids in the MLS, the Spaniard spent his entire playing career between Athletic Bilbao and Real Madrid.  Seven major honours were won with Los Blancos, which is where his coaching career got off the ground.  The three-time UEFA Champions League winner was appointed assistant manager to Jose Mourinho in 2010, with Real achieving La Liga, Copa del Rey and Supercopa de Espana success before Carlo Ancelotti arrived three years later and brought in his own backroom team.  Karanka was given his first managerial role later that year, replacing Tony Mowbray at Middlesbrough, only a few months into the 2013/14 Championship season.  By 2014/15, his first full term at the helm, Boro were challenging for a place in the Premier League but lost 2-0 to Norwich City in the Championship Play-off Final.  The 2015/16 season was a different story for Middlesbrough as they secured a return to the top flight after the Spaniard led the club to automatic promotion from the Championship.  Middlesbrough and Karanka parted ways in March 2017, with the club 19th in the Premier League table. ", "article_3": "The rationale behind Steve Gibsons long-standing reluctance to sack Aitor Karanka and the reason he ultimately felt impelled to dismiss Middlesbroughs first foreign manager were, paradoxically, both encapsulated by the Basques handling of Adama Traore.  A force-of-nature type winger, the former Barcelona prodigy turned Aston Villa flop was invariably instructed to switch flanks at half-time by Karanka.  This, Boros manager revealed, was to ensure Traore always operated within earshot of the home technical area so he could receive coaching throughout the game.  Such micro-management succeeded in producing a startling turnaround in Traores game and, most specifically, his decision-making, but it also sometimes unbalanced a team whose improvisational instincts were quashed by an ultra-controlling coach.  The detailed managerial instructions stemming from the mind-boggling 80-page dossiers Karanka compiled on opponents left Boro playing with the handbrake on and go a long way towards explaining why they have won four Premier League games this season and scored only 19 goals.  They are set up to play on the break and their conservative formation has left them lacking attacking outlets.  Debates behind the scenes between the manager and senior players anxious to adopt a more attacking approach are understood to have led to dissension between Jose Mourinhos former Real Madrid assistant and, among others, Alvaro Negredo, Gaston Ramirez, Antonio Barragan, Stewart Downing and Patrick Bamford.  Matters came to a head after last Saturdays 2-0 FA Cup defeat at home to Manchester City when Karanka was asked why Downing and Bamford had been excluded from the squad and replied he \"only wanted fighters\" playing for him.  Whereas Bamford, a PS6m January signing from Chelsea, has clearly been struggling, the omission of Downing - a Teessider the manager never really wanted to sign last season - stemmed from a training-ground row with the former England winger.  Downing, a popular and influential dressing-room figure, proved the wrong man for Karanka to fall out with.  All-round relations had been deteriorating for some weeks, months even, with the new year seeing Karanka turning on fans for shouting \"attack, attack\" and the board for failing to sign Robert Snodgrass in January, and even blaming a member of the clubs medical staff for confusion over the fitness of the left-back George Friend.  Stewart Downing, scoring here for Middlesbrough against Bournemouth, is influential in the dressing room and proved the wrong man for Aitor Karanka to fall out with.  Photograph: Scott Heppell/Reuters As grudges festered results declined to the point where Boro have gone 10 league games without a win, scoring only three goals during that run.  Somewhere during the transition from autumn to winter the stubbornness that served the former Real Madrid defender so well in winning automatic promotion last season changed, almost imperceptibly, into an increasingly self-destructive force.  One of Karankas favourite motivational slogans is: \"Tough situations dont last; tough people do. \" But his mistake was to see compromise and delegation as signs of weakness.  Intensely proud of his Basque heritage, the 43-year-old has a volatile side that led to the 2014 departure of Craig Hignett after nine months as his assistant, when the former Boro midfielder crossed him once too often.  Almost exactly a year ago a managerial tantrum led to his suspension by the club after a training-ground disagreement on the Friday before a Sunday defeat at Charlton.  Briefly placed on gardening leave and denied admittance to the club, Karanka remained at home while his team played.  Dismissal was widely expected but instead Gibson offered him the benefit of the doubt and was rewarded with automatic promotion.  Although the squad was strengthened appreciably during the summer - Negredo, Barragan, Marten de Roon and Traore were among the arrivals - and the boardroom harboured hopes of a mid-table finish, Karanka consistently maintained finishing 17th would be a triumph.  Resisting repeated calls to field two strikers, he persisted with one up front, resulting in a litany of draws and one of the divisions best defensive records.  In reality the system itself was not so much a problem as his rigid, low-risk interpretation of it, which often left Negredo isolated and led to his team-mates being censured for attempting to \"mix things up\" by sometimes unleashing long, early balls.  This purist philosophy drew admiration.  \"Boro are so sophisticated,\" enthused Alan Pardew, the then Crystal Palace manager, but it was Sean Dyches highly direct, distinctly non-frilly, fellow Premier League new boys, Burnley, who cantered into mid-table security.  Hints of tensions had emerged last summer when Steve Agnew, Hignetts replacement, appeared tempted to join his friend Steve Bruce at Aston Villa.  Ultimately Agnew stayed but there were strong suggestions the respected coach was not consulted and confided in as much as he should have been by a manager whose controlling characteristics were possibly made more pronounced during those seasons in Madrid spent studying the Mourinho mind games songbook.  Agnew was disappointed to see Jordan Rhodes, his nephew, sidelined by the manager and offered no chance to show whether his Championship goalscoring feats could be replicated in the top tier.  Part of the problem was Karanka felt Rhodes, now at Sheffield Wednesday, did not fit into his 4-2-3-1 system and could not operate as a lone striker.  Although Rudy Gestede and Bamford, Rhodess January replacements, theoretically fitted the configuration, both have proved alarmingly ineffective.  Tellingly Ben Gibson, the nephew of the owner, Steve, recently indicated a flawed philosophy was costing Boro dear.  \"We might have a very good defensive record but its hard to defend for as long as we defend sometimes,\" said the centre-half.  \"It takes 11 people to be working their socks off and pulling in the right direction. \" On Thursday his uncle acted on that message.

He is chiefly known for having written the draft of the libretto of the opera Don Pasquale for its composer Gaetano Donizetti. Ruffini had been condemned to death as an enemy of the state and was living in exile in Paris in 1842 when it was suggested to him by Jules Janin (newly appointed director of Theatre-Italien) that he might offer his services to Donizetti as a librettist .  Donizetti told him exactly what he required for his latest opera project, Don Pasquale, but not that he intended to re-use music already written for other purposes.  Ruffini duly wrote the draft libretto from the original text dating back to 1810, but Donizetti changed so much of Ruffini's version that librettist became angry and refused to allow his name to be mentioned in the programme for the premiere at the Theatre Italien in Paris 3 January 1843.  Although Ruffini refused acknowledgement of his work for the libretto, Donizetti paid him 500 francs, which was competitive for both the length and the genre at the time.  Ruffini also reportedly enjoyed working with Donizetti in the early stages of their collaboration, though he wrote to family and friends that the composer continually pressed him to work faster. Ruffini wrote several novels which were published in English by Thomas Constable & Company in Edinburgh, including Lorenzo Benoni Or Passages in the Life of an Italian (1853), The Paragreens on a Visit to the Paris Universal Exhibition (1856) and Doctor Antonio: A Tale (1858).

It really runs the gamut.  We remain resolutely in support of a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation, and we will continue to work in that direction.  And I have to say we were pleased by the renewal of the mandate at the United Nations just a week ago.

After completing his secondary education in Cyprus he studied medicine at the University of Lyon, France, from which he graduated with an M. D.  in 1974.  While at University, he co-founded an association to represent Cypriot students attending French universities and colleges.  Afterwards he moved to London where he obtained his specialization in geriatrics in 1981 at the Royal London Hospital (formerly London Hospital): during this period he also worked as a hospital doctor and as a lecturer.  After his degree he returned to Nicosia, where he started practising medicine privately. He began his political career with the centre-right Democratic Rally (DISY) in 1985 and obtained various positions in its youth Organisation, before being elected Chairman of the party's youth Organisation in 1990.  In 1991 he was elected to parliament, and two years later obtained his first governmental role as spokesman, a role he would keep until 1997.  That year he was appointed to the post of foreign minister in the second cabinet of President Clerides, a post he would hold until the 2003 elections.  He is heavily credited with having facilitated the accession talks of Cyprus into the EU, together with his government - thanks also to his long periods spent in France and Britain as a student.  He also took steps in improving relations with Turkey and the Turkish-Cypriot community. Always a convinced supporter of the EU and of accession, he was among the first group of Cypriot MEPs to be elected in 2004.  Once in Strasburg, he joined the Committee of Foreign Affairs, the Delegation for Relations with the Palestinian Legislative Council and the delegation to the Euro-Mediterranean Assembly, and is a substitute in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and in the delegation for relations with Canada.  In June 2009, he was elected Vice-Chairman of the European's People Party parliamentary Group, responsible for Foreign Affairs. In February 2008, he ran as a presidential candidate against incumbent President Tassos Papadopoulos in the general elections.  He was seen as the candidate backed by the international community, which believed he was the best suited to continue on the road towards reunification, especially after the hard-liner Papadopoulos.  Despite accessing to the run-off ballot with 33. 51% of votes, he was defeated by the left-wing party Akel's candidate Christofias.  Nevertheless, Kasoulides remains rather popular with Cypriot voters due to his open-mindedness and propensity to listen and negotiate.  He has received many honours from the Cypriot, Palestinian, Lebanese and Maltese governments for his diplomatic efforts. Ioannis Kasoulidis is married to Emy Droushiotou and has one daughter, Joanna.

Bernardino Ochino was born in Siena, the son of the barber Domenico Ochino, and at the age of 7 or 8, in around 1504, was entrusted to the order of Franciscan Friars.  From 1510 he studied medicine at Perugia. Bernardino Ochino in a 16th-century engraving.  At the age of 38, Ochino transferred himself in 1534 to the newly founded Order of Friars Minor Capuchin.  By then he was the close friend of Juan de Valdes, Pietro Bembo, Vittoria Colonna, Pietro Martire, Carnesecchi.  In 1538 he was elected vicar-general of his order.  In 1539, urged by Bembo, he visited Venice and delivered a course of sermons showing a sympathy with justification by faith, which appeared more clearly in his Dialogues published the same year.  He was suspected and denounced, but nothing ensued until the establishment of the Inquisition in Rome in June 1542, at the instigation of Cardinal Giovanni Pietro Carafa.  Ochino received a citation to Rome, and set out to obey it about the middle of August.  According to his own statement, he was deterred from presenting himself at Rome by the warnings of Cardinal Contarini, whom he found at Bologna, dying of poison administered by the reactionary party. Ochino turned aside to Florence, and after some hesitation went across the Alps to Geneva.  He was cordially received by John Calvin, and published within two years several volumes of Prediche, controversial tracts rationalizing his change of religion.  He also addressed replies to marchioness Vittoria Colonna, Claudio Tolomei, and other Italian sympathizers who were reluctant to go to the same length as himself.  His own breach with the Roman Catholic Church was final. In 1545 Ochino became minister of the Italian Protestant congregation at Augsburg.  From this time dates his contact with Caspar Schwenckfeld.  He was compelled to flee when, in January 1547, the city was occupied by the imperial forces for the Diet of Augsburg.  Ochino found asylum in England, where he was made a prebendary of Canterbury Cathedral, received a pension from Edward VI's privy purse, and composed his major work, the Tragoedie or Dialoge of the unjuste usurped primacie of the Bishop of Rome.  This text, originally written in Latin, is extant only in the 1549 translation of Bishop John Ponet.  The form is a series of dialogues.  Lucifer, enraged at the spread of Jesus's kingdom, convokes the fiends in council, and resolves to set up the pope as antichrist.  The state, represented by the emperor Phocas, is persuaded to connive at the pope's assumption of spiritual authority; the other churches are intimidated into acquiescence; Lucifer's projects seem fully accomplished, when Heaven raises up Henry VIII of England and his son for their overthrow.  Several of Ochino's Prediche were translated into English by Anna Cooke; and he published numerous controversial treatises on the Continent.  Ochino's Che Cosa e Christo was translated into Latin and English by the future Queen Elizabeth I of England in 1547. In 1553 the accession of Mary I drove Ochino from England.  He went to Basel, where Lelio Sozzini and the lawyer Martino Muralto were sent to secure Ochino as pastor of the Italian church at Zurich, which Ochino accepted.  The Italian congregation there was composed mainly of refugees from Locarno.  There for 10 years Ochino wrote books which gave increasing evidence of his alienation from the orthodoxy around him.  The most important of these was the Labyrinth, a discussion of the freedom of the will, covertly undermining the Calvinistic doctrine of predestination.  In 1563 a long simmering storm burst on Ochino with the publication of his Thirty Dialogues, in one of which his adversaries maintained that he had justified polygamy under the disguise of a pretended refutation.  His dialogues on divorce and against the Trinity were also considered heretical. Ochino was not given opportunity to defend himself, and was banished from Zurich.  After being refused admission by other Protestant cities, he directed his steps towards Poland, at that time the most tolerant state in Europe.  He had not resided there long when an edict appeared (August 8, 1564) banishing all foreign dissidents.  Fleeing the country, he encountered the plague at Pinczow; three of his four children were carried off; and he himself, worn out by misfortune, died in solitude and obscurity at Slavkov in Moravia, about the end of 1564. Ochino's reputation among Protestants was low.  He was charged by Thomas Browne in 1643 with the authorship of the legendary-apocryphal heretical treatise De tribus Impostoribus, as well as with having carried his alleged approval of polygamy into practice.  His biographer Karl Benrath justified him, representing him as a fervent evangelist and at the same time as a speculative thinker with a passion for free inquiry.  The picture is of Ochino always learning and unlearning and arguing out difficult questions with himself in his dialogues, frequently without attaining to any absolute conviction.

At the age of 7 or 8, in around 1504, he was placed in the care of the Franciscan Friars.  From 1510 he studied medicine at Perugia.  In 1534, Ochino obtained permission to transfer to the newly founded Order of Friars Minor Capuchin.  He was already a close friend of 'oratorio' spirituali such as Juan de Valdes, Pietro Bembo, Vittoria Colonna, Vermigli, and Carnesecchi.  In 1538 he was elected vicar-general of his order.  The next year, urged by Bembo, he visited Venice and delivered a course of sermons showing a sympathy with the doctrine of 'justification by faith', something explained even more clearly in his Dialogues (1539).  Prior to Ochinos exile he published his Lucchese sermons (delivered 1538/published 1541), his Venetian sermons (delivered 1539/published 1541) and his Dialogi Sette (1540, 1542), all in Italian.  A satirical writing by Ochino entitled Imagine di Antechristo, first printed at Geneva by Jean Gerard in 1542, later translated into French and German (1545), Spanish (1557), and Latin (1558), enjoyed special success.  (Caponetto 1999, p.  31) He was denounced, but evaded Church action until the establishment of the Roman Inquisition in June 1542.  Ochino received a citation to deliver himself to Rome, which he started to obey until he was deterred by the warnings of Cardinal Contarini, whom he found at Bologna, dying of poison administered by the reactionary party.  Some authors also connect the flight of Vermigli to the subsequent flight of Ochino.  Instead of continuing on to Rome, Ochino turned aside to Florence, and then went across the Alps to Geneva where he was welcomed by John Calvin.  Over the next two years he published a series of five books of Prediche, apologetic tracts defending his change of religion and addressing his Italian sympathizers such as Vittoria Colonna, Claudio Tolomei, among others.  These totalled some 295 sermons.  There were quite a number of Italian Protestant exiles in places such as Strasbourg, Zurich, and Augsburg, and so in 1545 Ochino became minister of the Italian Protestant congregation in the latter.  When in January 1547 the city was occupied by the imperial forces for the Diet of Augsburg, he was forced to flee once again.  This time he found asylum in England, where his fame went before him.  He was made a prebendary of Canterbury Cathedral, received a pension from Edward VI's privy purse, and composed his major work (in Latin) the Tragoedie or Dialoge of the unjuste usurped primacie of the Bishop of Rome (of which only a 1549 translation remains).  The Tragoedie is a series of dialogues depicting the papacy as the work of Lucifer and his demons which seems set to conquer all before it, when Heaven raises up Henry VIII of England and his son for their overthrow.  Several of Ochino's Prediche were translated into English by Anna Cooke; and he published numerous controversial treatises on the Continent.  Ochinos Che Cosa e Christo was translated into Latin and English by Elizabeth I herself (1547).  In 1553 the accession of Mary to the throne drove Ochino, Vermigli and others from England.  He went to Basel, and then Zurich, having been invited by Lelio Sozzini and Martino Muralto to pastor an Italian church there composed mainly of refugees from Locarno.  Ochino's flow of publications demonstrated that he was not well-aligned with the Calvinist mainstream of Swiss reformed thought.  His was an adventurous faith seeking individual experience of the love of God, and his theology was thus exploratory ('anti-dogmatic'), synthetic and idiosyncratic.  The Labyrinth, a discussion of the freedom of the will, critiqued the doctrine of predestination.  In 1563 Ochino published his Thirty Dialogues, the arguments in which relating to polygamy, divorce and the Trinity were considered by many to be heretical.  Ochino was summarily banished from Zurich, and took refuge in the relatively liberal state of Poland.  This safe haven was then denied him when an edict appeared (8 August 1564) banishing all foreign dissidents.  Fleeing the country, he encountered the plague at Pinczow; three of his four children died and he himself, worn out by misfortune, died in solitude and obscurity at Slavkov in Moravia, about the end of 1564.  Magisterial Protestant memory wasn't kind to Ochino's reputation, and unlike Vermigli, he ceased to have an extensive influence in the Protestant world.  Wenz, however, considers that his publications probably did more than any other to help form the diasporic Italian Protestant imagination.  His exile, Wenz suggests, provided him with the opportunities of the free printing press, which in turn allowed him to become 'the primary teacher of Italian Protestantism to his followers throughout Europe'.  Cantimori notes that he was 'perhaps the most important of the Italian reformers'.

Due to their indisputable importance, Ochino's work and role have been examined both in major studies (e. g. , the monographs by Karl Beinrath and Roland Bainton) and in recent critical editions devoted to a selected part of his many treaties.  Scholarly attention has been chiefly directed toward Ochino's \"reformed\" period, that is, the time following his notorious flight of 1542.  In that crucial year, the Capuchin friar, having suspected the Inquisitorial action against him by Paul III's Roman curia, reached the decision to leave both Italy and his order, and head toward Calvinist Geneva; this very move turned into a lifelong exile, which ended only with Ochino's death in Moravia, in 1564.  This past year, Michele Camaioni has released a monumental work on Ochino's Italian years.  During this time Ochino was a famous preacher (firstly as an observant Franciscan, then as a Capuchin who enjoyed prestigious positions within his order); was admired by the ecclesiastical authorities; and was widely acclaimed for the sermons he delivered throughout the country.  At this very time, Ochino acted (at least, from a given moment in time, only in appearance) according to the expectations of the Catholic higher clergy.  And, yet, he was progressively and simultaneously developing his own religious convictions.  Camaioni's volume comprises four chapters; the first three reconstruct the three decisive phases Ochino experienced before 1542.  The first pertains to the friar's training years and first preaching activity (up to about the mid-1530s), when he carried out his mission not only in his native Siena, but also in the Veneto region; there Ochino came into contact with leading personalities, such as Gian Matteo Giberti (bishop of Verona) and the Venetian cardinal Gasparo Contarini.  The following chapter focuses on the \"evangelical preaching\" triennium/biennium (1535-37) when Ochino reached the pinnacle of his preaching career and entered into contact with the Valdesian milieu.  The third chapter deals with the remaining years up to Ochino's flight.  Camaioni focuses in particular on Ochino's success and on his decisive transition to a concealed preaching style.  The latter is a sort of Nicodemitic expedient, necessary to avoid giving the appearance of deviating from ecclesiastical directives and, yet, not to renounce his own, new, religious and spiritual convictions.  It is inevitable, however, that the preaching in disguise could not have satisfied the Capuchin's own yearning for truth--he was living through a religious identity crisis at the time--confirmed by the continued \"heterodox proselytism,\" carried out in private gatherings and concurrent to the display of a regular public mission.  Such a perilous situation had definitely made him disagreeable to Cardinal Carafa, and eventually precipitated the decision to abandon altogether the church and his homeland.  Pertinently, a fourth chapter follows as a sort of corollary, and is centered on the first period of Ochino's exile: the arrival in Geneva (where he took on the role of community preacher for the local Italian exiles); his intense publishing activity, mostly consisting of sermons; his Augsburg sojourn; and the role he played for the Schmalkaldic League.  Camaioni's fine reconstruction is not merely a patient collection of historical data, but is rather, and most importantly, a story of how the Sienese's peregrination fits into, and contributes to, not simply a personal history of development and growth, but a broader historical period.  This reconstruction is carried out through the study of a body of documentary and bibliographic data.  Moreover, the author offers interpretative guides pertaining to the figure of Ochino, which become indispensable reading-keys for the entire legacy of the Sienese heterodox.  The word limit forces me to highlight only one aspect, namely Ochino's role as preacher.  This went beyond pastoral care and assumed the connotations of an extraordinary course of social and political commitment.  Indeed, on several occasions, Camaioni underscores how the words delivered from the pulpit called for charitable actions toward others in the search for God; such exhortation established a link between the personal sphere of faith and the public display of charity, which in sixteenth-century Italy had predominantly a collective dimension, as it entailed a close cooperation with the civil authorities.  This very aspect of Ochinian thought is, furthermore, revealing of the role assumed by one's works in binomial unity with one's faith: true charity does not amount to the execution of empty actions; it is rather the indispensable outcome of a deep search within, which ought to nurture one's trust in God and in his grace.  There is still much to be noted regarding Camaioni's book, rich as it is in ideas and interpretative suggestions.  What is certain is that this work is demonstrably a milestone within sixteenth-century Italian Reformation studies, and as such an irreplaceable text to know and understand an important period--thus far neglected--of the religious and existential parable of Bernardino Ochino. ", "article_3": "In discussing the authorship of the anonymous Treatise of the Three Impostors, the French Huguenot scholar Prosper Marchand reminded his readers that the text had been attributed to the Italian heretic Bernardino Ochino, \"the founder and patriarch of the Capuchin order\" who \"became a heretic, and then a Jew, and finally a Turk.  After all that, he turned out to be quite vindictive and wrote against all three, whom he called the greatest impostors of the world, among whom he counted Christ our savior, Moses, and also Mahomet\" (Dictionnaire historique [Pierre de Hondt, 1758], 1:316, no.  J).  Marchand's reference to Ochino was not an isolated example.  In the Republic of Letters, the Italian heretic enjoyed remarkable posthumous fame, almost becoming a celebrity in the circles of the libertinage erudit and the Radical Enlightenment.  While Gabriel Naude in his Avis pour dresser une bibliotheque suggested that Ochino be included in any respectable library, Bayle dedicated an article to him in the Dictionnaire historique et critique.  In the twentieth century, Ochino scholarship flourished thanks to historians such as Delio Cantimori, Roland Bainton, Benedetto Nicolini, Philip Mc Nair, and, more recently, Gigliola Fragnito, Massimo Firpo, Emidio Campi, Anne Overell, and Miguel Gotor.  While situating himself in this rich historiographical tradition, Michele Camaioni's recent book, Il Vangelo e l'Anticristo: Bernardino Ochino tra francescanesimo ed eresia (1487-1547), breaks new ground and offers what is so far the most detailed study of Ochino's life.  Camaioni traces Ochino's education and activity up to 1547, the year of the Battle of Muhlberg and a turning point in the history of the Reformation.  To be sure, Camaioni's goal is to reconsider not just the biography of one prominent religious reformer but, more generally, the religious crisis of sixteenth-century Italy, paying special attention to the fluid period before the opening of the Council of Trent when confessional boundaries were not yet rigidly defined and a reunification of the church still seemed possible.  Moving away from Cantimori's and Bainton's image of Ochino as a heretic \"with respect to all churches,\" Camaioni's first chapter (1-144) meticulously studies Ochino's Franciscan religious background, shaped on the one hand by the radicalism of figures such as Angelo Clareno and Ubertino da Casale and on the other by Bernardino of Siena.  The second and the third chapters (145-463) follow Ochino's movements during the 1530s and the early 1540s, when he joined the Capuchin order, becoming its vicar general in 1538.  Camaioni retraces in detail Ochino's relationship with several patrons and interlocutors, from Vittoria Colonna to Caterina Cibo to Juan de Valdes, as well as his strategy as a preacher, convinced that it was possible to reform the church from within and to reconcile the doctrine of the justification by faith alone with the obedience to Rome.  It was in this period, during which he earned the admiration of humanists and artists such as Bembo, Aretino, and Tiziano that Ochino preached \"Christo mascherato\" in order to reach different audiences while avoiding exposing himself to the guardians of orthodoxy (290-291).  Intertwining religious and political history, Camaioni also recovers Ochino's strong ties with the Colonna family and with \"l'Italia dell'imperatore\" (cf.  Elena Bonora, Aspettando l'imperatore [Turin, 2014]), whose anticlericalism and opposition to Rome often led them to sympathize with the Reformation.  Finally, the fourth chapter (465-574) considers the first years of Ochino's exile, when the failure of the Colloquy of Regensburg convinced him to leave Italy.  Examining the period that he spent in Geneva and Augsburg, Camaioni brings the book to its conclusion, highlighting how, in rebutting the attacks of Catholic polemicists such as Girolamo Muzio and Ambrogio Catarino Politi, Ochino broke away once and for all from Rome and from his Franciscan past.  Il Vangelo e l'Anticristo belongs to a new phase of scholarship that, in the wake of the \"post-Cantimori pardigim shift,\" has succeeded in contextualizing the ideas of the Italian heretics in the religious crisis of Renaissance Italy, moving beyond old disciplinary boundaries and intertwining religious and political history.  Camaioni's investigation into Ochino's Franciscan background deserves special praise.  The effort to study the social and political impact of Ochino's preaching is also highly interesting and especially relevant in an age in which oral communication continued to play a crucial role, despite the traditional historiographical insistence on the \"printing revolution. \" In this respect, Camaioni fruitfully dialogues with the recent scholarship on early modern orality, developed by scholars such as Giorgio Caravale, Stefano Dall'Aglio, Brian Richardson, Massimo Rospocher, and others.  One might regret that the book ends with 1547, leaving aside the years in which Ochino interacted with Sebastian Castellio and Elizabeth I and argued against Calvin on the Servetus affair.  Indeed, when Ochino left for England in 1547, he did not abandon his Italian contacts.  Tudor England offered refuge to many Italian exiles, who often reciprocated keeping communication open with Counter-Reformation Italy, acting as intelligencers and cross-confessional brokers in the midst of the religious strife.  More attention could have been dedicated also to the wide circulation of Ochino's writings, translated into many different languages, which were appropriated and misread by Catholic censors, European reformers, and later by libertines and philosophes.  But these are only minor shortcomings of Camaioni's rich and stimulating book, which will be of interest for anyone working on the religious crisis of sixteenth-century Italy and on its relationship with the European Reformation.

Bernardino Ochino (1487-1564), the son of a Sienese barber, had a highly successful career within the Roman Catholic Church.  He made meteoric progress in two religious orders, especially if one considers he also studied medicine for a time: he was Definitor General of the Franciscan Friars Observant and General of the Capuchins.  He became so famous for his asceticism and preaching that Pope Paul III personally took charge of arranging Ochinos speaking engagements.  His public saw Ochino as the embodiment of the ideals of St.  Francis.  Some in religious orders agreed, others saw in him the Antichrist.  The Dialogi sette, completed in 1542, are among Ochinos few extant pre-exilic works and show how this master of the spoken word preached \"Christ in a mask\" for many years.  By subtle use of the dialogue form Ochino was able to deal repeatedly with such controversial themes as justification by faith and the church of the elect.  By 1542 Ochino could no longer safely stay in his beloved homeland for fear of the Inquisition.  Contrary to his hopes, Ochino spent the last part of his life at odds with established Protestant theologians.  In the end he died an outcast from mainstream Protestantism as well as Roman Catholicism.  The Editor: Rita Belladonna is Associate Professor of Italian at York University.  Her other works include numerous articles on the circulation of Protestant ideas in early sixteenth-century Siena, Alessandro Piccolominis LAlessandro and George Chapmans May-Day, Bartolomeo Carli Piccolomini and his imitation of Juan Valdes Alfabeto Cristiano and other related subjects.

Taking his surname from the Sienese district dellOca, Ochino joined the Franciscan order in the Roman Catholic church about 1504, but in 1534 he left for the stricter Capuchin order, of which he became vicar-general (1538-42).  His renown as a preacher soon prompted papal regulation of his appearances.  After being commissioned to read and refute works by Protestant Reformers, and after meeting the Spanish religious writer Juan de Valdes in Naples in 1536, Ochino was converted to Protestantism.  At first he withheld his open support because he hoped that Italy would embrace the Protestant cause for reform, but in 1542, when the Roman Inquisition summoned him, he fled over the Alps to the community of John Calvin at Geneva.  There he demonstrated his Protestantism by marrying, and in 1545 he was made a pastor in the German community of youthful bankers at Augsburg.  Fleeing Augsburg after its fall in the Schmalkaldic War (1546-47), Ochino went to England.  There he played a prominent part in the Reformation under King Edward VI, praising the reforms of Edward and Henry VIII in his Tragoedie or Dialoge of the Unjuste Usurped Primacie of the Bishop of Rome (1549).  When the Catholic queen Mary I ascended the English throne in 1553, Ochino returned to Europe to become a pastor to Italian refugees at Zurich.  He antagonized city officials, however, by strident tracts against the Roman Catholic doctrine of purgatory and by minimizing the differences between Calvinist and Lutheran views concerning the Lords Supper.  Attempting to avoid local censorship, he issued at Basel his Dialogi XXX (1563), in one of which he appeared to advocate polygamy.  For this and for alleged anti-Trinitarian attitudes he was banished, and in December 1563 he left for Poland, where his Tragoedie was published in Polish in an edition adapted to the local situation.  Polish Catholics managed to have him banished, and he died from the plague while traveling in Moravia. "}}

He was born at Fregenal de la Sierra, in Extremadura, and died at Seville.  He is the subject of an Elogio historico by Tomas Gonzalez Caral in the Memorias de la Real Academia de la Historia (Madrid), vol. After studying at the universities of Seville and Alcala, he took orders about the year 1559.  He became a clerical member of the Military Order of St.  James, and accompanied the Bishop of Segovia to the Council of Trent (1562) where he won great distinction. [citation needed] On his return he retired to a hermitage at Aracena whence he was summoned by Philip II (1568) to supervise a new polyglot edition of the Bible, with the collaboration of many learned men.  The work was issued from the Plantin Press (1572, 8 volumes) under the title Biblia sacra hebraice chaldaice, graece et latine, Philippi II regis catholici pietate et studio ad sacrosanctae Ecclesiae usum, several volumes being devoted to a scholarly apparatus biblicus.  Arias was responsible for a large part of the actual matter, besides the general superintendence, and in obedience to the command of the king took the work to Rome for the approbation of Pope Gregory XIII.  Final Judgement by by Johannes Wierix , illustration of the 'Humanae Salutis Monumenta' (1571) Leon de Castro, professor of Oriental languages at Salamanca, to whose translation of the Vulgate Arias had opposed the original Hebrew text, denounced Arias to the Roman, and later to the Spanish Inquisition for having altered the Biblical text, making too liberal use of the rabbinical writings, in disregard of the decree of the Council of Trent concerning the authenticity of the Vulgate, and confirming the Jews in their beliefs by his Chaldaic paraphrases.  After several journeys to Rome Arias was freed of the charges (1580) and returned to his hermitage, refusing the episcopal honours offered him by the king.  He accepted, however, the post of a royal chaplain, but was only induced to leave his retirement for the purpose of superintending the Escorial library and of teaching Oriental languages.  He led the life of an ascetic, dividing his time between prayer and study.  In addition to the works written in connection with the polyglot, the most celebrated of which is Antiquitatum judaicarum libri IX (Leyden, 1593), Arias left many commentaries on various books of the Bible; also: Humanae salutis monumenta (Antwerp, 1571); a Latin translation of the Itinerary of Benjamin of Tudela, and other works on widely varying subjects.  He was also celebrated as a poet, his verses being chiefly of a religious nature. References ", "article_1": "Biografia Arias Montano, Benito.  Fregenal de la Sierra (Badajoz), 1527 - Sevilla, 6. VII. 1598.  Hebraista, biblista, supervisor de la Biblia Poliglota de Amberes y humanista destacado de la Contrarreforma.  Nacio en el seno de una familia perteneciente a la baja nobleza, hidalga aunque empobrecida y cristiana vieja.  Su padre desempenaba el cargo de notario del Santo Oficio de la Inquisicion.  Un padrino suyo acomodado lo envia a estudiar a Sevilla, donde a la edad de catorce anos escribe un Discurso del valor y correspondencia de las antiguas monedas castellanas con las nuevas, y por un soneto que escribe se sabe que Alonso Garcia Matamoros, Cristobal Valdotano y Pedro Mexia fueron sus primeros maestros.  Con diecinueve anos se matricula en la universidad sevillana en un curso de artes.  Por entonces, en la ciudad del Guadalquivir florecia el erasmismo y el protestantismo espanol daba sus frutos a traves de los sermones de Juan Gil y Constantino Ponce de la Fuente.  Con esos conocimientos y vivencias, se traslada a Alcala de Henares en cuya universidad (1550) y en sus destacados saberes hebraicos se matricula, impartidos por los antiguos maestros del Colegio Trilingue.  Cipriano de la Huerga, monje cisterciense, Andres de la Cuesta y Luis de la Cadena le ensenan su metodo de estudio biblico, consistente en un constante apoyarse en el texto hebreo y su confrontacion con la Vulgata para revisarla y corregirla a la luz de la erudicion humanistica y la exegesis filologica.  Sera cursando sus estudios en la universidad cisneriana cuando conozca al tambien alumno fray Luis de Leon, cuya sincera amistad le acompanara toda la vida.  Son por entonces los ultimos anos del reinado de Carlos V recorridos en el plano del pensamiento por los planteamientos erasmistas de la philosophia Christi.  Arias Montano comienza a demostrar que es un buen poeta.  Asi, escribe una coleccion de poemas de corte horaciano no solo contra el proceder de Lutero, sino tambien de encomio hacia maestros y amigos con el titulo de Rethorica, siendo laureado por la universidad (1552) en renido certamen.  Y por su notable conocimiento y dominio de las lenguas hebrea, caldea y siriaca comienza a llamarsele el Jeronimo espanol.  Viajes por Italia y Espana, la compra de libros a los herederos de Sebastian Fox Morcillo, y estancias en su retiro familiar de la Pena de Aracena ocupan los siguientes anos a sus primeros estudios universitarios, ya que vuelve a las aulas sevillanas --en 1556 y 1558--, y decide tambien aprender Medicina y Botanica junto al medico Francisco de Arce.  Con treinta y tres anos (1560) pide ser admitido como sacerdote en la Orden de Santiago y tras una minuciosa investigacion para descartar toda posible ascendencia de sangre judia, de linaje manchado, es admitido en el monasterio de San Marcos de Leon.  Muy pronto su excepcional valia le llevara a ocupar un destacado lugar en la trama politica, espiritual e intelectual de su epoca.  El obispo Martin Perez de Ayala lo selecciona para incorporarlo a la delegacion espanola presente en el Concilio de Trento (1545- 1563), donde tuvo una meritoria intervencion con dos discursos sobre el divorcio y sobre la comunion bajo las dos especies.  De regreso a Espana es nombrado capellan del Rey y comienza a percibir una pension anual por sus servicios a la Iglesia y a la Corona.  Su obra Comentaria in XII Prophetas ocupa los anos siguientes, hasta que con cuarenta anos (1568) recibe el encargo mas importante de su vida: ser en Amberes el supervisor real de la nueva Biblia Poliglota en cinco lenguas que desde hacia unos anos estaban llevando a cabo un grupo de eruditos franceses y flamencos.  El contacto con la realidad politica, social y religiosa de los Paises Bajos, influira decisivamente en todo su pensamiento y actitudes.  El ambicioso proyecto biblico habia sido puesto en marcha por el impresor Plantino (1566) movido a ello por el hebraista Andreas Masius (Maes).  Sabio y erudito impresor, pero tambien habil hombre de negocios, habia fundado su taller (1554) gracias al dinero que mercaderes ricos pertenecientes a la secta espiritual Familia Charitatis (Familia del Amor) y discipulos del profeta Hendrik Niclaes le habian prestado, con la intencion de difundir desde aquellas prensas los escritos del carismatico fundador.  La pertenencia a la secta del propio Plantino y de aquellos ricos hombres --Charles de Bomberghe, Graphaeus, Santforts, De la Faille y el banquero converso Marcos Perez-- permanecia en el mas absoluto secreto.  Todos ellos tuvieron activa participacion en la efervescencia religiosa de los Paises Bajos y mientras unos abrazaron el protestantismo, otros se hicieron calvinistas.  Ante el Iconoclasmo (1566) y la llegada del duque de Alba huyeron a Alemania o a Suiza.  Plantino, para salvar su negocio prefirio atraerse la voluntad de Felipe II.  Buscando la proteccion del cardenal Granvela, escribio al secretario real Gabriel de Zayas manifestandole su profunda \"ortodoxia\" y adhesion a la Corona espanola.  Su astucia dio resultado: tras consultar el Monarca a los teologos de Alcala y de Salamanca y obtener una respuesta afirmativa unanime, acepta el mecenazgo, recibiendo Plantino el nombramiento de \"prototipografo del rey\".  En cuanto a la labor de Arias Montano, esta consistiria en revisar las pruebas y redactar unos cuantos tratados de erudicion biblica que constituirian el ultimo volumen de la Poliglota.  Los cuatro anos que duro esta mision fueron extraordinariamente intensos en acontecimientos publicos y privados.  Al principio, Montano se muestra partidario admirador del duque de Alba y aprueba la politica de Felipe II en los Paises Bajos.  Fernando Alvarez de Toledo y Pimentel, tercer duque de Alba (1507-1582), habia logrado terminar con la revuelta de los gueux o \"mendigos\", la confederacion de nobles de tendencias protestantes y calvinistas opuestos a la politica real entre los que se hallaban Luis de Nassau, hermano de Guillermo de Orange --antiguo paje de Carlos I-- Juan y Felipe de Marnix, Felipe Broderode, el conde de Egmont y Felipe de Montmorency, conde de Horn y almirante de Flandes.  Todos ellos habian suscrito un documento llamado \"Compromiso de Breda\" en el que la Confederacion se proponia abolir la Inquisicion y conseguir la libertad de conciencia.  Cuando al de Alba se le encarga la represion de la revuelta en Flandes, tenia sesenta anos.  Embarca en Cartagena rumbo a Genova en abril de 1567 y en Italia organiza un ejercito integrado principalmente por espanoles con algunos contingentes de italianos magnificamente equipados, entre los que figuraban cuerpos de mosqueteros.  Apreso a los cabecillas de la rebelion, los condes de Egmont y de Horn, a sus secretarios y al burgomaestre de Amberes, Antonio de Stralen.  La audacia de este golpe atemorizo a las gentes y el vencedor escribio a Felipe II: \"Gracias a Dios, el pais entero esta tranquilo\".  El duque constituyo el Tribunal de los Tumultos para juzgar a los supuestos culpables de los desordenes, conociendose entre el pueblo como el Tribunal de la Sangre.  En aquellos anos de completa pacificacion, purgado el pais de calvinistas, Arias Montano estaba entregado por completo a su trabajo de la Biblia Poliglota, que seria conocida tambien como Biblia Regia o Biblia de Amberes.  Hoy ya no cabe la menor duda de que toda la gloria de la ingente labor correspondio al esplendido equipo de sabios linguistas y filologos reunidos en torno al taller de Plantino y pertenecientes en secreto a la Familia del Amor.  Sin embargo, su papel de supervisor y su participacion --en especial en la redaccion de los tratados del ultimo volumen-- en el diseno y contenido de la Poliglota, fueron decisivos, con consecuencias insospechadas a favor y en contra en los circulos teologicos y humanisticos de Espana y Europa, lo que le acarrearia incomprension, sospecha inquisitorial y desengano.  Concluida la labor filologica en mayo de 1570, Arias Montano envia su Praefatio a las Universidades de Lovaina y de Paris que le dan su aprobacion.  Seis meses mas en la imprenta para disponer todos los textos y por fin la obra ve la luz a finales de 1571, encuadernada en ocho volumenes.  Con el texto dispuesto en dos series de columnas en cada pagina, los volumenes del I al IV contienen: el texto hebreo, el mismo que figura en la Poliglota de Cisneros y que editara Charles de Bomberghe en la imprenta de Felix Pratensis (1516-1517) y en Venecia en la imprenta de Yaaqob ben Hayyim (1524-255); la Septuaginta y su traduccion latina, el Targum --traduccion al arameo del Antiguo Testamento con parafrasis-- casi completo y su traduccion latina debida a los hebraistas judeo-conversos del Estudio Salmantino, Pablo Coronel y Alonso de Zamora, colaboradores en la Poliglota de Alcala.  El volumen V contiene: el Nuevo Testamento en tres versiones, griega, latina de la Vulgata y siriaca con traduccion latina de Guido (o Guy) Lefevre de la Boderie.  Los volumenes VI, VII y VIII son conocidos como Apparatus.  El volumen VI contiene: el Nuevo Testamento en griego y traduccion interlineal de la Vulgata; particularidades de la lengua hebrea redactada por Arias Montano; el Antiguo Testamento y traduccion latina debida a Sancte Pagnino (o Sanctes Pagninus).  El volumen VII contiene: diccionario y gramatica griegos, tal vez de Arias Montano; un vocabulario siriaco debido a Andreas Masius (Maes), asi como una gramatica siriaca; un diccionario siro-arameo debido Guido Lefevre de la Boderie; en latin un Thesaurus hebraicae-linguae de Sanctes Pagninus y un Apendice de Francisco Raphelengius.  El volumen VIII contiene: dieciocho tratados filologicos y arqueologicos, varios de ellos debidos a Montano; los Prefacios de Arias Montano; los Prologos de san Jeronimo a la Vulgata; cartas de Felipe II, del duque de Alba y de Arias Montano, y los privilegios de publicacion y las censuras de Arias Montano.  Asi pues, la nueva Biblia, obra en esencia de los humanistas del norte de Europa, venia a ser una reedicion, pero critica, de la Poliglota de Cisneros, empleando como ella las ediciones hebreas del Antiguo Testamento impreso en Venecia pero presentando un centenar de lecturas diferentes respecto de la cisneriana, y mas cercanas a la edicion veneciana.  En cuanto a esa serie de gramaticas y vocabularios, la moderna investigacion los considera un material bastante problematico y a veces poco preciso.  Pero su gran novedad, que seria en su tiempo su gloria y su condena, fue la incorporacion de la ciencia hebraica --Targum, Pesitta--, y, por lo tanto, saber heterodoxo, sospechoso de herejia.  Este \"monumento de la Contrarreforma\", obra de intelectuales de dudosa ortodoxia catolica, impresa en un taller creado en principio para publicar los escritos del lider espiritual Niclaes, cuyo impresor habia pedido prestados los tipos hebreos al protestante Charles de Bomberghe, y el \"supervisor\" real habia tenido la intencion de sustituir el texto canonico de la Vulgata --al que apenas le reconocia valor filologico-- por la traduccion latina de la Biblia hecha por Sanctes Pagninus (Lyon, 1527), aunque al final tuvo que transigir e incluyo ambos textos, fue vista como una obra reaccionaria contra los principios del Concilio de Trento y la infalibilidad de la Vulgata de san Jeronimo.  Roma tenia que juzgarla, y para defenderla se nombro al teologo espanol Pedro de Fuentiduena.  Su exposicion fue inutil.  Aquellas innovaciones hebreas y rabinicas, aquellas rectificaciones a la Poliglota de Cisneros que era tanto como enmendar la Vulgata, suscitaron graves recelos y objeciones entre los miembros de la comision papal que la desaprobaron.  Ante tal fracaso, las cartas se cruzan impresiones contrariadas y los contactos politicos y diplomaticos se suceden.  Arias Montano recibe el encargo real de salir inmediatamente para Roma.  Felipe II escribe al duque de Alba: \"Creo que podra explicar el asunto de manera que ponga punto final a todas las dudas\".  Y asi fue, porque ya en Roma (1572) logra en pocos meses la ansiada aprobacion, aunque provisional.  Contribuyo a ello el sucederse de algunos acontecimientos como la subida al solio pontificio de Gregorio XIII, muy favorable a Espana.  La victoria de Lepanto contra los turcos favorecio tambien el fortalecimiento de las relaciones entre el Vaticano y la Corona espanola.  Mientras, Arias Montano se ganaba el apoyo de los cardenales de talante humanista Granvela y Sirleti.  Pero la aprobacion provisional de la Congregatio Concilii no logro acallar la polemica que se avivaba por momentos y que, en definitiva, siempre estuvo latente o manifiesta en el seno de las discusiones teologicas del siglo XVI en torno a que texto de la Biblia, el hebraico --visto con recelo por amplios sectores--, o la traduccion latina de san Jeronimo (Vulgata), era el correcto.  Como escribe B.  Rekers: \"Arias Montano intento aplicar un metodo de traduccion puramente literal basado en la erudicion filologica; es decir, pretendio traducir exactamente lo que estaba escrito en el texto original\".  Ponia en practica la intencion de Erasmo de \"predicar a Cristo desde las fuentes\".  Solo que el biblista espanol hacia caso omiso de toda la tradicion exegetica catolica y su \"simbolismo\", prefiriendo buscar el sentido a traves de las fuentes exegeticas rabinicas, mas acorde con los nuevos metodos de investigacion y estudio humanisticos, que pretendian rescatar la pureza original del texto biblico.  La Iglesia era consciente de las imperfecciones de la Vulgata, y queria a toda costa evitar nuevas traducciones, y como medida \"disciplinar y defensiva\", el Concilio de Trento declaro \"autentica\" la Vulgata latina.  Este sentir explica la respuesta reaccionaria a su Poliglota.  En los Paises Bajos, Guillermo Lindano, obispo de Rurmond, arremete contra el, haciendo todo lo posible por desacreditar su labor biblica.  Por el contrario, no faltaron sabios de Lovaina y de Paris que se erigieron en paladines de su metodo, como Harlemio, Genebrard y Francisco Lucas.  La reaccion espanola fue la mas virulenta: en Castilla, en los circulos teologicos agustinos de Salamanca se alzo en contra la voz del maestro Leon de Castro --hermano de habito de fray Luis de Leon y su delator ante el tribunal inquisitorial--, quien como tantos otros \"que ponian enfermedad\" en la nueva Biblia, redacto sus objeciones en seis folios que leyo en la Corte, sin mucho exito.  En su escrito argumentaba que los originales hebraicos y caldaicos estaban corrompidos por los judios y tenian que ser corregidos a la luz de la Vulgata y no al reves, como se habia hecho en la Biblia Regia.  Esta conviccion volvia sobre el viejo asunto de la hebraica veritas de la Espana judia y las viejas disputas del siglo XV.  Y por si fuera poco, el termino \"judaizante\" --tan lleno de tristes y no tan lejanos recuerdos-- se aplicaba ahora a todo aquel que defendia la legitimidad del texto hebreo y la revision critica de la Vulgata.  Los amigos de Montano, pertenecientes al ambito universitario salmanticense, le tuvieron bien informado de las maniobras del maestro Leon.  Fray Luis de Estrada le escribe: \"Cierta persona ha querido persuadir, y por ventura tiene persuadida a casi toda Espana, que los originales hebraicos y caldaicos de la divina Scriptura estan corrompidos por los judios [. . . ] que en la mesma emprenta (se refiere a la de Plantino) sin ser sentidos los herejes habian introducido traicion\".  Y Pedro de Fuentiduena en carta (1574) al secretario real, Gabriel de Zayas, expone: \"[. . . ] y despues aca he entendido que el maestro Leon fue a la corte y alla trato con esos senores del consejo de la Inquisicion sobre esto de la biblia de Flandes [. . . ] y asi lo da a entender a todos, tanto que ayer me dijo un maestro desta universidad que le habia oido decir que si estando revestido para decir misa, lo dejase por ir a quemar a Benito Arias, le parece que haria gran servicio a N.  Sr. \"; Francisco de Salinas le hace saber (1574): \"[Hable] con el buen maestro Leon, porque es amigo muy antiguo y fue mi maestro en la ninez; el cual me dio muchas disculpas y excusas con decir que no podia dejar de estar apasionado por su madre la Iglesia, y su principal negocio, es decir que V.  M.  quiere destruir la Vulgata y que no sigue la interpretacion de ningun santo ni le alega sino la de los rabinos\".  En este ambiente tan tenso se alzo la palabra escrita del canonigo Juan del Cano (1575) increpando el mal entendido celo del fraile agustino que \"atropella a sus proximos con voces vocalisimas y con su autoridad [. . . ] destruye a cuantos no se guardan de trabar con V.  M.  disputaciones\".  A pesar de tantos sinsabores, Arias Montano no cejo en su estudio biblico.  Fruto de ello en colaboracion con la Universidad de Lovaina fue su Biblia Sacra, impresa por Plantino en 1574.  Las circunstancias le obligan a volver a Roma para afrontar la segunda defensa de la Poliglota.  Intento vano, pues el maestro Leon habia logrado atraer a su causa la opinion de la Curia Papal.  Encabezada por el cardenal Belarmino se pronuncia: \"Esta Congregacion General ha sentenciado que nada contrario al texto latino de la Vulgata puede ser cambiado, ni siquiera una palabra, una silaba o una letra\".  Pero, como habia en juego factores politicos, se aprueba toda la Biblia Poliglota excepto el Apparatus, debido a Montano.  Gregorio XIII prefiere dejar el dictamen final en manos de los teologos espanoles.  La causa del maestro Leon parecia que habia triunfado.  Y Arias Montano escribe una carta en agosto de 1575 al obispo de Cuenca e inquisidor general, Pedro de Portocarrero, buscando su proteccion: \"Cuasi por todo este postrer ano que he estado en Flandes, he sentido un grande rumor que un maestro Leon de Castro, que vive en Salamanca, ha levantado en aquella universidad, reprendiendo y desacreditando la mayor obra que jamas en genero de letras ha salido al mundo impresa, que es la biblia real [. . . ] el asa que ha tomado para decir mal de ella, ha sido ver alli en el Aparato una parte de la biblia de Sanctes Pagnino [. . . ] le suplico sea servido de mandarme dar aquella parte desta noticia [. . . ] que me sea a mi util [. . . ] para que con brevedad y equidad [. . . ] se deshagan con entera luz estos nublados\".  La sentencia final sobre la Biblia de Amberes le correspondio al jesuita Juan de Mariana (1577).  Su defensa la limpio de escrupulos y de recelos, a pesar del intento de los dominicos de Sevilla (1579) de reavivar la polemica.  Y en 1587 la curia romana intentara, sin mucho exito, eliminar las variantes de los diversos textos de la Vulgata latina.  Habria que esperar a la Biblia Clementina (1592) con su revision mucho mas segura del texto latino.  Con su regreso a Espana (1576) como bibliotecario de El Escorial, concluyen sus densos ocho anos de estancia en los Paises Bajos.  Se traia una desencantada vision de la politica espanola en Flandes, que en otro tiempo admirara, y su rendida adhesion a la secta espiritual flamenca de la Familia del Amor (Familia Chraritatis), entre las posturas catolica y protestante y cuyos principios --tolerancia, no violencia, paz, devocion de tendencia quietista, la \"identificacion personal con el ser divino\", y el alejamiento de los ritos y dogmas aunque sin romper el vinculo con la Iglesia Catolica-- profesaban la mayor parte de las personas cultas y de negocios de Amberes que formaban el circulo del impresor Plantino, seguidor en un principio de Niclaes, de tendencia protestante, para despues preferir la doctrina simbolico-esoterica de tendencia catolica del maestro Henrik Jansen Barrefelt, apodado Hiel (Luz de Dios).  Como bibliotecario, elaboro la lista de todos los manuscritos existentes --superaban la cifra de cuatro mil--, inventario los libros impresos e invirtio buena parte de los fondos puestos a su disposicion en la adquisicion de escritos semiticos de los que la biblioteca escurialense estaba bastante escasa: \"empero de Sangrada Escritura y materia de religion tiene falta\".  Esta labor la alterno con la de profesor de hebreo en el colegio del monasterio.  Su sabio magisterio supo aunar la ensenanza de la lengua biblica con la difusion entre sus discipulos de la espiritualidad de Hiel.  Fray Jose de Siguenza, Lucas de Alaejos, Martin de la Vera, Francisco Trujillo y Gaspar Centol, continuadores en su momento de la labor escrituristica de Montano, supieron de la ideologia familista y de la interpretacion \"visionaria\", en esta epoca ya aceptada por Montangal o, de los textos biblicos.  Si la Orden Jeronima habia sido a lo largo del siglo XV un intenso foco de criptojudaismo, ahora el familismo de Hiel prendia en ella a traves del magisterio biblico del sabio espanol.  El mismo no habia dejado de pedir a su amigo Plantino que le enviara todos los comentarios posibles de Hiel, en especial sus comentarios al Apocalipsis.  Como ha demostrado Sabbe, \"nueve decimos del latin de Arias Montano son copia exacta de las Sendbrieffe de Hiel\".  Despues de su ultima mision politica en asuntos relacionados con el rey Sebastian de Portugal, sobrino de Felipe II, Arias Montano pudo residir en su retiro de Extremadura (1586), y a intervalos en el convento sevillano de Santiago.  En la Pena de Aracena enseno hebreo a Pedro de Valencia, \"criado a los pechos de la santa y universal doctrina de Montano\" a decir de su contemporaneo Covarrubias, y que seria su secretario y el editor en Amberes de sus obras postumas.  Benito Arias Montano murio en Sevilla (1569) en casa de Ana Nunez.  En la ciudad del Guadalquivir logro reunir en torno a su persona un grupo de intelectuales progresistas espanoles, donde no faltaron miembros conversos como Diego y Francisco Nunez Perez, emparentados con conversos de Amberes, que si bien no tuvieron el peso espiritual del grupo escurialense, supieron establecer vias de intercambio cientifico y pensamiento liberal, segun el espiritu montaniano, entre las Universidades de Sevilla y Leyden.

He received a substantial literary training, and became a preceptor and boon companion of Giovanni dei Medici, the future Pope Leo X (from 1513 to his death in 1521).  In November 1494, when the Medici were banished, he supported them.  Soon afterwards he was rewarded with the protection of Julius II and many honours at the Roman court.  In 1513 his arduous efforts on behalf of his lifelong patron secured the election of Giovanni dei Medici to the pontifical throne.  Leo X repaid such services by naming him a Cardinal in the Consistory of 23 September 1513, and appointing him Cardinal Deacon of S.  Maria in Porticu.  Leo continued to show his favor by appointing Bibbiena his treasurer and entrusting him with many important missions, among them the command of the Papal army in the War of Urbino (1517) and a legation to France (1518).  Later on, the cardinal's strong sympathies for France lost him Leo's confidence.  As cardinal he steadily extended his generous patronage of the arts - he was a close friend of Raphael, whom he had known since his youth, and arranged his engagement to his niece.  Raphael painted a number of works for him, including frescoes of a classical and erotic style for his bathroom in the Vatican. His literary fame is mainly connected with the first comedy of note written in Italian prose, La Calandra (also, known as Il Calandro and La Calandria), was probably given for the first time at Urbino, about 1507.  It was performed elaborately at Rome, seven years later, in the presence of Leo X and Isabella Gonzaga d'Este, Marchioness of Mantua.  Though containing glaringly immoral scenes, using the plot of Plautus's Menaechmi, it possessed the features of modern comedy and won plaudits for its sparkling wit and fine characterization.  The main character, Calandro or Calandrino, was borrowed from Giovanni Boccaccio's Decameron in which he appears as a character in four stories.  The author of the comedy sympathizes with Fulvia, and her lover Lidio, mocking the foolish husband of Calandro, who falls in love with Lidio, who changes into women's dress.  The speeches of Fesenio, the servant of Calandro, shine with Italian sparkling jokes.  Ariosto and Machiavelli imitated this comedy in their plays.  A Paduan poet serving at the Dresden Court, Stefano Benedetto Pallavicino, wrote a libretto based on the same story for the comic opera Calandro by Giovanni Alberto Ristori.  It was first staged in 1726 at the castle of Pilnitz near Dresden, and in 1731 in Moscow it was the first ever opera performed in Russia.  There were also the operas by: Antonio Sacchini, L'avaro deluso, o Don Calandrino (24 November 1778 London) (24 November 1778 London) Johann Georg Schurer, Calandro (20 January 1748 Dresden) (20 January 1748 Dresden) Giuseppe Gazzaniga, Il Calandrino (1771 Venice) See also  References ", "article_1": "Public Transit to Via Cardinale Bernardo Dovizi - Montalone in Arezzo How to get to Via Cardinale Bernardo Dovizi - Montalone in Arezzo, Italy?

He made a 20-volume epitome of Verrius Flaccus's voluminous and encyclopedic treatise De Verborum Significatione.  Flaccus had been a celebrated grammarian who flourished in the reign of Augustus.  Festus gives the etymology as well as the meaning of many words, and his work throws considerable light on the language, mythology and antiquities of ancient Rome.  He made a few alterations, and inserted some critical remarks of his own.  He also omitted such ancient Latin words as had long been obsolete; these he apparently discussed in a separate work now lost, entitled Priscorum verborum cum exemplis.  Even incomplete, Festus' lexicon reflects at second hand the enormous intellectual effort that had been made in the Augustan Age to put together information on the traditions of the Roman world, which was already in a state of flux and change.  Of Flaccus' work only a few fragments remain; of Festus' epitome, only one damaged, fragmentary manuscript.  The rest is further abridged in a summary made at the close of the 8th century, by Paul the Deacon.  The Festus Lexicon Project has summed up Paul's epitome of Festus' De Verborum Significatu as follows: The text, even in its present mutilated state, is an important source for scholars of Roman history.  It is a treasury of historical, grammatical, legal and antiquarian learning, providing sometimes unique evidence for the culture, language, political, social and religious institutions, deities, laws, lost monuments, and topographical traditions of ancient Italy. The 11th-century Codex Farnesianus at Naples is the sole surviving manuscript of Festus.  It was rediscovered in 1436 at Speyer by the Venetian humanist and bishop Pietro Donato. When he found it, half of the manuscript was already missing, so that it only contains the alphabetized entries M-V, and not in perfect condition.  It has been scorched by fire and disassembled.  Collating these fragmentary abridgments, and republishing them with translations, is a project being coordinated at University College London, with several objectives: to make this information available in usable form, to stimulate debate on Festus and on the Augustan antiquarian tradition upon which he drew, and to enrich and to renew studies on Roman life, about which Festus provides essential information.

Bibliography  Further reading ", "article_1": "Festus, Sext.  Pompeius a lexicographer of uncertain date.  He certainly lived after Martial, whom he quoted (Vespae), and before Macrobius, who refers to him more than once (3. 3, 5, comp.  8. ).  From his remarks upon the wordwe conclude that he must have belonged to an epoch when the ceremonies of the Christian religion were familiar to ordinary readers, but Saxe has no authority for fixing him down to the close of the fourth century (A.  D.  398).  Works The name of Festus is attached to a dictionary or glossary of remarkable Latin words and phrases, which is divided into twenty books, and commonly bears the title Sexti Pompeii Festi de Verborum Significatione.  This is a compilation of the highest value, containing a rich treasure of learning upon many obscure points, connected with antiquities, mythology, and grammar; but before we can make use of it with safety it is necessary that we should understand the history of the work, and be made acquainted with the various constituents of which it is composed.  De Obscuris Catonis De Plauti Calculis De Jure Sacro et Augurali M.  Verrius Flaccus, a celebrated grammarian, in the reign of Augustus [FLACCUS VERRIUS], was the author of a very voluminous treatise, De Significatu Verborum.  This was compressed into a much smaller compass by Festus, who made a few alterations ( e.  g.  s.  v. ) and criticisms (e. g. ) of his own, inserted numerous extracts from other writings of Verrius, such as the, and others; but altogether omitted those words which had fallen into disuse (), intending to make these the subject of a separate volume(see).  Finally, towards the end of the eighth century, Paul, son of Warnefrid, better known as Paulus Diaconus, from having officiated as a deacon of the church at Aquileia, abridged the abridgment of Festus, dedicating his production to Charlemagne, after that prince had dethroned Desiderius, the last king of the Lombards, whom Paul had served as chancellor.  The original work of Verrius Flaccus has altogether perished with the exception of one or two inconsiderable fragments.  Of the abstract by Festus one imperfect MS.  only has come down to us.  It was brought, we are told, from Illyria, and fell into the hands of Pomponius Laetus, a celebrated regarded scholar of the fifteenth century, who for some reason now unknown kept possession of a few leaves when he transferred the remainder to a certain Manilius Rallus, in whose hands they were seen in 1485 by Politian, who copied the whole together with the pages retained by Pomponius Laetus.  This MS.  of Rallus found its way eventually into the Farnese library at Parma, whence it was conveyed, in 1736, to Naples, where it still exists.  The portion which remained in the custody of Laetus was repeatedly transcribed, but it is known that the archetype was lost before 1581, when Ursinus published his edition.  The original codex written upon parchment, probably in the eleventh or twelfth century, appears to have consisted, when entire, of 128 leaves, or 256 pages, each page containing two columns; but at the period when it was first examined by the learned, fifty-eight leaves at the beginning were wanting, comprehending all the letters before M; three gaps, extending in all to ten leaves, occurred in different places, and the last leaf had been torn off, so that only fifty-nine leaves were left, of which eighteen were separated from the rest by Laetus and have disappeared, while forty-one are still found in the Farnese MS.  In addition to the deficiencies described above, and to the ravages made by dirt, damp, and vermin, the volume had suffered severely from fire, so that while in each page the inside column was in tolerable preservation, only a few words of the outside column were legible, and in some instances the whole were destroyed.  These blanks have been ingeniously filled up by Scaliger and Ursinus, partly from conjecture and partly from the corresponding paragraphs of Paulus, whose performance appears in a complete form in many MSS.  This epitomizer, however, notwithstanding his boast that he had passed over what was superfluous and illustrated what was obscure, was evidently ill qualified for his task; for whenever we have an opportunity of comparing him with Festus we perceive that he omitted much that was important, that he slavishly copied clerical blunders, and that when any expression appeared perplexing to his imperfect scholarship he quietly dropped it altogether.  He added a little, but very little, of his own, as, for example, the allusion to his namesake, the apostle (), and a few observations under&c.  It is evident from what has been said that the book, as commonly exhibited, consists of four distinet parts:-- 1.  The fragments of Festus contained in the Farnese MS.  now deposited in the Royal library at Naples.  2.  The fragments of Festus retained by Pomponius Laetus, the archetype of which, although lost before the end of the sixteenth century, had previously been frequently transcribed.  These two sets of fragments, as far as they go, are probably a tolerably correct though meagre representation of the commentaries of Verrius Flaccus.  3.  The epitome of Paulus Diaconus, consisting of inaccurate excerpts from Festus, a mere shadow of a shade, but even these imperfect outlines are very precious.  4.  The interpolations of Scaliger and Ursinus, foisted in for the purpose of filling up the blanks in the outside columns of the MS.  of Festus.  These are of course almost worthless, since they must be merely as specimens of ingenuity.  Although it is manifest how much the four parts differ from each other in value, yet all are in most editions mixed up into one discordant whole, so that it is impossible, without much labour and research, to analyse the mass and resolve it into its elements.  Hence we not unfrequently find in the essays of even distinguished scholars quotations professedly from Festus, which upon examination turn out to be the barbarous blunders of Paulus, or even simply the lucubrations of Ursinus.  We have now, however, been happily relieved from all such embarrassments by the labours of Muller, whose admirable edition is described more particularly below.  The principle upon which the words are classified is at first sight by no means obvious or intelligible.  The arrangement is so far alphabetical that all words commencing with the same letter are placed together.  But the words ranked under each letter are, as it were, divided into two parts.  In the first part the words are grouped, according not only to the initial, but also to the second and even the third and fourth letters; the groups, however, succeed each other not as in an ordinary dictionary but irregularly.  Thus we find at the beginning of R, not the words in, but those in, next those in, next those in, next those in, next those inandmixed, next those in, and againandmixed.  In the second part regard is paid to the initial letter alone without reference to those which follow it, but the words placed together have in most instances some bond of connection.  Thus in the second part of P we find the seriesall of which belong to sacred rites, and especially to auspices.  Again,terms relating to civil law;names of tribes, and so on.  The same word is frequently explained both in the first and in the second part, and sometimes the two explanations are at variance; thus,occur in both the first and second parts of R, while the remarks onin the first part of O are inconsistent with what is said upon the same words in the second part.  The same word is never repeated twice in the first part, but this sometimes happens in the second, when it falls to be interpreted under two heads, as in the case ofThe first part in some letters is headed by a few words altogether out of their order, which seem placed in a conspicuous position on account of their importance or from some superstitious feeling.  Thus M is ushered in bywhile the first fifteen articles in P are almost all derived from the most ancient memorials of the Latin tongue.  These facts, taken in combination with the authorities quoted here and there, would lead us to infer that the words in the first part of each letter were taken directly from the De Significatu Verborum of Verrius, while those in the second constitute a sort of supplement, collected by Festus from the other writings of the same author.  We might also surmise, from the singular order, or rather want of order, discernible in the first part, that Verrius wrote down his observations upon certain sets of words upon separate sheets, and that these sheets were bound up without regard to any circumstance except the initial letter.  An elaborate discussion upon these points will be found in the preface to the edition of Muller.  Editions Joannes de Colonia and Joannes Manthen de Gherrezen, 4to.

Festus the man is obscure; even the elements of his name are uncertain.  The hypothesis that he came from Gaul largely derives from an entry in a mid-twelfth century monastic catalogue at Cluny which records a liber Festi Pompeii ad Arcorium Rufum, identified as a descendant of the grammarian C.  Artorius Proculus, whom Festus cites.  Inscriptions at Narbonne may also suggest a connection between the two families (CIL 12. 4412, 12. 5066).  However, Festus Gallic origin remains unproven.

Verrius Flaccus on the meaning of words; only one partial manuscript of Festus epitome exists, lacking its beginning and end, known since the 1450s.  Even the authors name is uncertain; no reliable details of his life or even dates for him are known, except that he is mentioned by a probably ce grammarian (Pomponius Porphyrion)1 and is also cited, though calling him Iulius Festus not Pompeius Festus, by the antiquarian Macrobius (in a work probably of the 430s ce). 2 There has been some speculation about his place of origin, possibly Gallic, but certainty cannot be reached.  The Verrius ( ce), whose work Festus epitomized, was a prominent figure in the time of Augustus.  Only miserable fragments of his work survive today,3 and even the exact Latin title is not certain; but parts are preserved through the tradition of epitomes, through Festus himself, and through Paul the Deacon, who summarised Festus summary in the ce.  There is a very brief life of Verrius by Suetonius,4 from which we learn that he acted as tutor to Augustus grandsons.  It is possible, on the basis of what we know, to assess the significance of his work on the republican tradition in the context of the new Augustan regime. 5 We can be certain that Festus epitome of Verrius was already known about, though not available, long before the 1450s, but only from Pauls summary of it.  Paul, who lived from c.  ce to the 790s ce, was a literary figure in the Carolingian Renaissance, acquainted with Charlemagne, and working at times in the great Benedictine House at Monte Cassino, though also at other places in Italy, and very probably at the Court of Charlemagne.  His epitome of Festus is dedicated to Charlemagne. 6 It seems unlikely that he would have offered his epitome as a gift, as he says he did, if the Library had already had a full text of Festus himself.  Presumably therefore, the epitome was not composed at Court, but somewhere in Italy, possibly Monte Cassino.  We know of many copies of Pauls epitome from the early medieval period, implying that the epitome was popular at the time as a dictionary. 7 It was also printed as early as , forty years or so before the newly found manuscript of Festus himself.  The surviving manuscript of Festus is called the Farnesianus (F = IV. A. 3 in the Naples National Library) after the family that owned it early in the . 8 It is dated to the and was probably written in Rome or nearby.  The first section, down to the letter M, is lost, and so is the ending, from the letter T onwards.  In what survives, of the two original columns on each page, the internal column is complete and usually very readable; all the outside columns are damaged by fire and water, leaving only a third to half of each line in a readable state, with many doubtful readings on the edge of what does survive.  When the Farnesianus was first recovered, there were more foldings (quaternions, i. e. , four sheets folded once = 16 pages) than are now preserved in the Naples Library.  Originally there had been sixteen quaternions, but of these, the first seven were apparently already missing when the manuscript was rediscovered; of the remaining nine, six are still extant in Naples.  Three (VIII, X, and XVI) were subsequently lost, because the humanists who first worked on the text divided the quaternions up and lost track of some of them.  In a dedicatory note to an edition of Paul published in ,9 Manilius Romanus addressing Pomponio Leto speaks of reading the \"mutilated books of Pompeius Festus,\" presumably while they were in Letos own house, though he does not in fact say so.  We do have copies of parts of the lost pages, the most reliable of which are those made by Politian (Angelo Poliziano, ).  Versions of these apographs are incorporated in modern editions.  The story of the discovery of the Farnesianus has recently been rewritten and redated; it had been thought that it was brought to Italy from Illyria by Manilio Rallo, a Greek poet and humanist who was born in ; but scholars have now found that the text of F was already known to and used by Lorenzo Valla, professor of rhetoric, who died in . 10 There has been a continuous tradition of work on the manuscript text since its discovery: the first printed edition was probably that of , but the earliest versions tried to produce a full text by supplementing the manuscript from Pauls epitome.  The best way to present the evidence was worked out over many years: Antonio Agustins edition11 was the first to place the texts of Festus and Paul side by side, so a comparison became possible; he also included passages from the apographs.  Scaliger, reacting to Agustins edition, but also borrowing much from him, produced a brilliant critique in ,12 often grasping the theme of entries on the basis of fragments of texts.  Fulvio Orsini13 produced a new edition in , in which each of his pages corresponded to a whole column of the Farnesianus.  Where the column is a fragmentary one, his restorations are printed in italic.  He also includes as a separate section the copies of the missing quarternions, but does not show (if he knew) where they should be fitted into the manuscript text.  It was Mullers edition of 14 that matched the books pages to the pages and lines of the Farnesianus and placed the apographs in their correct order and the relevant Paul entries on the facing page.  This layout left much blank paper, and such generosity with space can only now be matched by on-line versions.  The modern working text is Wallace M.  Lindsays Teubner edition,15 though Mullers is also still useful, and often used.  Lindsays text is not based on a new reading of the Farnesianus, but it does report in its apparatus criticus readings taken from Mullers edition, and newer ones supplied to him from contemporaries or through the work of Thewrewk de Ponor, who worked on an edition that he never completed, but did pass on the materials he had assembled to Lindsay.  So, in addition to the early editors, Lindsays app.  crit.  quotes the views on the readings of a set of witnesses, including E.  A.  Lowe (earlier, Loew), Wilhelm Cronert, and others. 16 Thewrewk organized the publication of a photographic reproduction of the whole of the Farnesianus, available in some Libraries. 17 Lindsay produced a second version of Festus epitome as part of the Glossaria Latina iussu Academiae Britannicae edita, Vol.  4 ( ).  In this version, he produced a great deal of material from other ancient and medieval glossaries that he thought relevant to the reconstruction and supplementation of Festus entries. 18 His own suggestions are at times speculative, and the edition remains the safest text to use, as well as the easiest to find; but the material collected by Lindsay (1930) is potentially valuable to those trying to recover the sense of entries.  There have been suggestions that Festus was not relying on Verrius alone as his source of information, but using other authors as well.  There is in fact some confirmation in the extant text that his main objective was to summarise this particular work: he claims that he was weeding out useless material and so producing a cut-down version of the text; but he also claims that he was omitting his criticisms of Verrius, which were to be pursued in another work of his. 19 So his point seems to be that, in the book we have, he omits silently what he disagrees with; the meaning of this lemma is disputed, and it remains a puzzle why he chose to make his point in a particular entry and not at the beginning of the whole work.  Whatever prologue he may have written is lost together with the early books.  It is also perhaps surprising that he should be so critical about the quality of a work to which he was devoting so much time and effort. 20 There are other criticisms of Verrius ideas elsewhere in the Lexicon. 21 In a broad sense, the Lexicon was drawn up on alphabetic principles; at least, all the headwords beginning with a particular letter are grouped together.  Sometimes this alphabetization is carried on to the second or third letter of a run of words.  But this principle seems to have been applied far more methodically in the opening section of any letter than in the later parts.  Various suggestions have been made to explain this feature.  Perhaps the first section is at a more developed stage of drafting, while the second consists of notes ready to be integrated; while this idea might work for a single letter, it seems unlikely that it would arise for letter after letter.  In any case, it would be impossible to look up a particular word as in a modern dictionary.  In the manuscript of Festus that we have, the first letter of the headwords (or lemmata) are picked out, so a page can be scanned quite quickly; but we have no way of knowing when this practice might have been introduced.  The choice of words for inclusion raises other questions as well: most of the interest lies in the republican period, approximately down to the end of the bce.  One clear indication of this is the range of texts quoted to illustrate usages; and bce texts predominate together with early (i. e. , pre-Ciceronian) texts. 22 This strongly suggests that the user was imagined with historical tastes: the law, religious antiquities, the topography of Rome, political and constitutional life are the sources of many entries.  Another feature is that the words chosen are often not common everyday words, but rather rare, obscure, archaic, or poetic words.  When it comes to the choice of quotations, early poetry predominates (especially that of Ennius, Plautus, and Lucilius), while early prose is mostly represented by the Twelve Tables and Cato the Elder.  The point of an entry is generally to illustrate a point of language, grammar, or meaning; but Festus is sometimes generous in the amount of the text included.  One interesting case is that of Plautus, where the texts are generally known from surviving manuscripts, so we can compare these with the text as recorded in the ce. 23 Much attention is regularly given to the origin of words and phrases.  By modern standards, the suggested etymologies are often hopelessly speculative; but they are endlessly informative about the way in which ancient antiquarians thought about words and their historical development. 24 The second epitomator, Paul the Deacon, was the author of other historical works, including a history of the Lombards and a Historia Romana, continuing the work of Eutropius Breviarium.  In his epitome of Festus, he was aiming at a radical shortening of most of the entries he includes.  Sometimes, he manages to include a good deal of the original content; this seems to happen mostly when the content is legal, constitutional, or religious, perhaps the themes that interested him most.  It is an interesting feature that, in the case of religious entries, he regularly uses past tenses to mark pagan practices, irrespective of the tenses used by Festus himself.  He also includes a great deal of purely etymological importance.  Sometimes, he abbreviates by retaining the first and last sentences, whether or not they relate to one another.  He omits most of Festus' quotations and has no room for the discussion of earlier antiquarians, who still figure prominently in the surviving Festus entries.  On the other hand, it needs to be remembered that he was using a manuscript much older than F, which may have included good readings subsequently corrupted.  The overall impression is of an author serious and knowledgeable about his own interests, but also inclined to take short cuts in the interests of brevity. 25", "article_4": "Abstract The Lexicon of Festus has never been published in English translation.  Although several modern editions were prepared in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Festus is accessible only to those who can read him in the Latin original or who can read a nineteenth-century French translation based upon a now-obsolete Latin edition.  While this state of affairs may have sufficed in the past, the general decline of Latin reading ability and the delaying of Latin language study to the university undergraduate level has rendered this untranslated text inaccessible to a large swathe of students and enthusiasts in the English-speaking world.  This is unfortunate not only because the Lexicon of Festus is a fascinating text in its own right, being an early example of a dictionary and encyclopedia, but also because it contains much information which will be of use to those interested in the institutions and religion of Rome, the peoples of ancient Italy, and Latin linguistics, among other topics.  My edition of translated selections includes scholarly notes and a full introduction setting the Lexicon in its historical context.  It makes parts of this text accessible for the first time to those without Latin reading ability. ", "article_5": "Sextus Pompeius Festus, (flourished 3rd century ad, Narbo, Gaul [now Narbonne, France]), Latin grammarian who made an abridgment in 20 books, arranged alphabetically, of Marcus Verrius Flaccus De significatu verborum (\"On the Meaning of Words\"), a work that is otherwise lost.  A storehouse of antiquarian learning, it preserves by quotation the work of other authors that has not survived elsewhere.  The first half of Festus work, too, is lost, but a further abridgment of it by Paul the Deacon in the 8th century survives.  In his abridgment Festus made a few insertions of his own, and removed obsolete Latin words with the intention of publishing them as a separate work, but it is doubtful whether this was ever written.  The remains of his abridgment exist in only one manuscript, the Codex Festi Farnesianus, at Naples.

Alexander was born to a family of Oryol nobility and was of Russian/Belarusian, French, Georgian, and Tatar descent. He studied in Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum, then served in the Hussar Leib Guard regiment. In 1896 he was a member of the Russian mission of the Red Cross in Ethiopia, where he became a confidant of Negus Menelek II of Ethiopia.  He begins arrival to Ethiopia with phenomenal showy courier's marathon by reason of record speed with the use of camel, during this courier's march the Nikolay Leontiev meets him to give help.  In 1896 - 1899 he became a military aide of Menelek II in his war with Italy and the southern tribes.  Bulatovich joined the expedition of Ras Wolde Giyorgis and became the first European to provide a scientific description of the Kaffa province (conquered by Menelek II where Bulatovich was among the Army).  He was the first European to reach the mouth of the Omo River.  Among the places named by Bulatovich is the Nicholas II Mountain range.  He had to ask permission from the Emperor himself to name the range in his honour.  After Bulatovich returned to Russia he received a Silver Medal from the Russian Geographical Society for his work in Ethiopia and the military rank of a poruchik (later rotmistr) of the Leib Guard Hussars.  He served in Saint Petersburg.  In 1903 after his talks with Saint John of Kronstadt he resigned from the Army and became a monk (later hiero-schema-monk) of the Russian Skete of Saint Andrew near the much larger St.  Panteleimon Monastery on Mount Athos in Greece.  He also visited Ethiopia again trying to establish a Russian Orthodox Monastery there.  He was tonsured as Father Antony and became known as Hieromonk Antony Bulatovich.  In 1907 after reading the book On Caucasus Mountains by the schema-monk Ilarion, he became one of the leaders of the imiaslavie movement within the Russian Orthodox Church.  When the movement was proclaimed a heresy and disbanded by a Russian military force in 1913, he was in St.  Petersburg pleading the cause of monks.  He continued his fight for the recognition of imiaslavie, published many theological books proving its dogmas, obtained an audience with the Tsar and eventually managed to secure some sort of rehabilitation for himself and his imiaslavtsy comrades.  They were allowed to return to their positions in the Church without repentance. In 1896-1899 he became a military aide of Menelek II in his war with Italy and the southern tribes.  Bulatovich joined the expedition of Ras Wolde Giyorgis and became the first European to provide a scientific description of the Kaffa province (conquered by Menelek II where Bulatovich's was with the army ).  He was the first European to reach the mouth of the Omo River.  Among the places named by Bulatovich is the Nicholas II Mountain range.

In 1903 after his talks with Saint John of Kronstadt he resigned from the Army and became a monk (later hiero-schema-monk) of the Russian Skete of Saint Andrew near the much larger St.  Panteleimon Monastery on Mount Athos in Greece.  On August 28, 1914, Antony Bulatovich received permission to join the Russian Army as an army priest.  During World War I Father Antony not only served as a priest but on \"many occasions led soldiers to attack\" and was awarded the Cross of St. After returning from the war he took part in the discussion about the imiaslavie.  In October 1918 the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church canceled the decision allowing imyaslavtsy to participate in church services provided they repent.  The decision was signed by Patriarch Tikhon of Moscow.  In January 1919, Anthony Bulatovich stopped any relations with the Holy Synod and Tikhon and returned to his family estate in Lebedinka, where he started a small skete and lived the life of a hermit.  He was the spiritual opponent of any civil war. On the night of December 6, 1919 he was murdered.  There are conflicting accounts if the killers were deserters of White Army or Red Army or some unaffiliated robbers. Antony Bulatovich was most probably the original for the grotesque Schema-Hussar Alexei Bulanovich from the novel The Twelve Chairs by Ilf and Petrov.  He is also the hero of Valentin Pikul's story The Hussar on a Camel.  In addition he is the hero of the novel The Name of Hero by Richard Seltzer (published by Houghton Mifflin in 1981).

Russian people in Ethiopia", "article_1": "For us, Abyssinia can present the following interest.  Having cast a glance at the map of Central Africa and on the borders of the Ethiopian Empire, you can easily see that being located in the vicinity of the Middle Nile, halfway between Egypt and the great lakes, which belong to England, Abyssinia, which is expanding each year more and more and taking large tracts of land which had been free-rich and densely populated territory-must become the natural and main enemy of England in Central Africa.  England is also our enemy.  To help the enemy of our enemy, to make him as much stronger as possible-that is our main goal in Abyssinia (Seltzer 2000:144).  [End Page 281] It is hard to imagine so many contrasts united in one person, as are united in the Abyssinian character.  Their character is like the nature around them-where precipices, cliffs, mountains and plains alternate among one another, and cold is mixed with tropical heat.  If I allow myself a rather free comparison, this is how I would characterize the Abyssinian.  He is talented and receptive, like a Frenchman.  With his practicality, with the way he deals with those he has conquered and his governmental abilities, he is like an Englishman.  His pride is like that of a Spaniard.  By his love for his faith, his mildness of character and tolerance, he is like a Russian.  By his commercial abilities, he is like a Jew.  But in addition to all these characteristics, he is very brave, cunning, and suspicious (Seltzer 2000:73).  II The above two seemingly political paragraphs taken from the writings of Alexander Bulatovich, along with seemingly ethnologically rich journal entries that he recorded during his travels, detailing his experiences in Ethiopia in the late nineteenth century, can perhaps be used to examine the \"colonial meaning making\" and \"convention of representation\" (Pratt 1992), in writings of the period.  Here I argue that, similar to his journal entries, these paragraphs represent a commentary by Bulatovich with an aim to establish similarities between Ethiopians and Europeans.  The journal entries have an additional subject matter, which is the private imagination of Bulatovich in the African jungle, which interacts with the Russian readers.  These journal entries articulate the social convention of \"Africanism\" (Morrison 1992) in the late nineteenth century.  Through establishing similarities between Ethiopians and Europeans, Bulatovich rendered Ethiopia a possible imperial world power, which would have been taboo to imagine, as an African colonial power.  Bulatovich's private imagination of Ethiopia as a possible black power complicates his written texts, sometimes by contradicting them entirely, other times by providing a subtext that expresses one of his motives, to become an explorer of the unknown regions of Lake Rudolf.  Studies by Mary Louis Pratt (1992), Toni Morrison (1992), and Edward Said (1978) on travel writing and literary criticism portray the complex dynamics of power relations, such as the ones found in Bulatovich's writings, aimed at articulating different strands of representation that constitute imperial expansionism.  These studies are shaped by a number of shared questions which focus on how travel and exploration writings produce particular knowledge about the indigenous people in relation to the Europeans at particular points in history.  This paper draws from these scholarly works in examining the travel writings of Alexander Bulatovich in Ethiopia.  I consider, for example, Bulatovich's attempts to redefine the \"geopolitical realignments\" (Pratt 1992) and his scientific explorations in the African hinterland.  His elaborate ethnographic descriptions of the light-skinned Ethiopian Christians, the dark-skinned pagans, and feminine Muslim Ethiopians, exemplify the politics of \"contact zones\" (Pratt 1992).  My reading of Bulatovich's journal entries is shaped by a number of shared questions, such as how Bulatovich portrayed Ethiopia as a potential black colonial power in the imagination of the Europeans; and his attempt to legitimate Ethiopian imperialism against the European colonial powers, in particular England.

Florian's mother, a Spanish lady named Gilette de Salgues, died when he was a child.  He was brought up by his grandfather and studied at St.  Hippolyte.  His uncle and guardian, the Marquis of Florian, who had married a niece of Voltaire, introduced him at the chateau de Ferney and in 1768 he became page at Anet in the household of the Duc de Penthievre, who remained his friend throughout his life.  Having studied for some time at the artillery school at Bapaume he obtained from his patron a captain's commission in the dragoon regiment of Penthievre.  He left the army soon after and began to write comedies, and was elected to the Academie francaise in 1788.  On the outbreak of the French Revolution he retired to Sceaux, but he was soon discovered and imprisoned; and though Robespierre's death spared him, he died a few months later still in prison. The cause of death was tuberculosis.

J.  Grandville , (ca.  1842) from a 1845 edition of, published by Garniers Brothers, Paris To later readers, Florian was chiefly known as the author of pretty fables well suited as reading for the young, but his contemporaries praised him also for his poetical and pastoral novels.  Florian was very fond of Spain and its literature, doubtless owing to the influence of his Castilian mother, and both abridged and imitated the works of Cervantes. [citation needed] Florian's first literary efforts were comedies; his verse epistle Voltaire et le serf du Mont Jura and an eclogue Ruth were crowned by the Academie francaise in 1782 and 1784 respectively.  In 1782 also he produced a one-act prose comedy, Le Bon Menage, and in the next year Galatie, a romantic tale in imitation of the Galatea of Cervantes.  Other short tales and comedies followed, and in 1786 appeared Numa Pompilius, an undisguised imitation of Fenelon's Telemaque.  In 1788 he became a member of the Academie francaise, and published Estelle, a pastoral of the same class as Galatie.  Another romance, Gonzalve de Cordoue, preceded by an historical notice of the Moors, appeared in 1791, and his famous collection of Fables in 1802.  Among his posthumous works are La Jeunesse de Florian, ou Memoires d'un Jeune Espagnol (1807), and an abridgment (1809) of Don Quixote, which, though far from being a correct representation of the original, had great success.  Florian imitated Salomon Gessner, the Swiss idyllist, and his style had all the artificial delicacy and sentimentality of the Gessnerian school.  Perhaps the nearest example of the class in English literature was afforded by John Wilson's Lights and Shadows of Scottish Life (written as Christopher North).  Among the best of his fables were reckoned The Monkey showing the Magic Lantern, The Blind Man and the Paralytic, and The Monkeys and the Leopard. The Blind man and the Paralytic The Monkey and the Magic Lantern The Monkeys and the Leopard The Fable and the Truth The Crocodile and the Sturgeon' The Child and the Mirror The Old Tree and the Gardener The Nightingale and the Prince The Two Travelers The Cricket (also known as True Happiness) Theatre Other Pastorales Varietes et contes en vers Plaisir d'amour , a song , a song Memoires d'un jeune Espagnol Famous verses  Florian wrote a collection of fables.  From these fables several expressions have passed into colloquial French: Pour vivre heureux, vivons caches : \"In order to live happily, live hidden\" : \"In order to live happily, live hidden\" Chacun son metier, les vaches seront bien gardees : \"To each his occupation, and the cows will be well guarded. \" : \"To each his occupation, and the cows will be well guarded. \" Rira bien qui rira le dernier: \"He who laughs last laughs best. \" The expression eclairer la lanterne (\"light the lantern\") is also drawn from Florian's fables.  His most famous verse is Plaisir d'amour, a poem he put in his story Celestine.  The verse became a song which has survived to the 21st century.

They were poets, fabulists, painters, playwrights, actors, composers and writers.  Some of the writers became the foundation for the LAcademie Francaise, which was established in 1635 by Cardinal Richelieu, the chief minister to King Louis XIII.  The Academie is the most distinguished learned body on matters pertaining to the French language.  The Freelance History Writer would like to take a look at some of these remarkable artists.  Jean-Pierre Claris de Florian was born on March 6, 1755 at the Chateau of Florian near Sauve, Gard in southern France.  His mother was a Spanish lady named Gilette de Salgues and she died when Jean-Pierre was a child.  He was brought up by his grandfather with his uncle, the Marquis de Florian acting as his guardian.  The Marquis was married to the niece of Voltaire, the Enlightenment writer, historian and philosopher and introduced Jean-Pierre to Voltaire at his chateau of Ferney.

Although the death of Robespierre spared de Florian death, he ended up dying a few months later while still in prison on September 13, 1794.  Many of his works were published after his death including his famous collection of Fables in 1802, as well as an abridgment of Cervantes 'Don Quixote in 1809 which was very successful.

This book in 12 volumes further divided into 128 chapters was one of the earliest systematic works on acupuncture and moxibustion, and it proved to be one of the most influential. Huangfu Mi also compiled ten books in a series called Records of Emperors and Kings (Chinese: Di Wang Shi Ji ; pinyin: Diwang shiji).  He was also the coauthor of Biographies of Exemplary Women (Chinese: Lie Nu Chuan ; pinyin: Lienu Zhuan).", "article_1": "Huangfu Mi was born in the year 215 in a poor farmhouse in Anding Chaona (now Lingtai of Gansu Province) of the Eastern Han Dynasty (25-220).  He was first named as Jing, later changed into Mi, with a style name of Shi'an.  When he was young, he took the famous scholar, Xi Tan, in his village as his teacher, and several years later, he became a well-known scholar.  In his opinion,only when you had given up the pursuit for fame and wealth could you do no damage to your life and when you given up the pursuit for riches and honor could you cultivate great virtues.  Hence,although the district magistrate invited him to work as an official and offered him an honorary title, and the prime minister summoned him to serve the court, he refused all the invitations.  He was willing to spend all his life studying classical books and writing books in order to spread knowledge to others and later generations.  At the age of 40, he was so unlucky as to contract a wind-syndrome and got hemianesthesia and myophagism in his right leg.  After taking the hanshi san (powder medicine for wind-syndrome), he got drug poisoning.  All his body was hot, so he had to eat ice and snow to cool down and exposed his body even in cold winter.  In summer he suffered even more -- cough, asthma, and edema, accompanied with the feeling of ache and heaviness in the limbs.  He was in a critical condition at any time.  The torture tested his willpower, and the desire for life urged him to read medical classics.  The effect of acupuncture therapy on his wind syndrome (rheumatism) fueled his strong interest in acupuncture and moxibustion.  Thus, he read a lot of literature on acupuncture and moxibustion, and finally became a master in this field.  At his time, there were many classical medical books, but the definitions of acupuncture points along the channels and collaterals were not unified.  So, he made a comparative study on the three popular books then, namely, Huangdi Zhenjing (Yellow Emperor's Canon on Acupuncture), Su Wen (Inner Book of the Yellow Emperor: Simple Questions) and Mingtang Kongxue Zhenjiu Zhiyao (Mingtang's Essentials of Acupuncture Points), by reclassifying their contents, deleting redundant words, simplifying the contents and detailing the essence.  With all the efforts, he wrote the 10-volume Huangdi Bu Zhenjiu Jiayi Jing (Yellow Emperor's Jiayi Canon on Acupuncture and Moxibustion).  It is also called Zhenjiu Jiayi Jing (Jiayi Canon on Acupuncture and Moxibustion), or simply called Jiayi Jing.  The book was finished around the year 259.  In the Northern and Southern dynasties (420-581), it was changed into a 12-volume book.  The original book was compiled in the order of the Heavenly Stems (in it, the first was called \"jia\", the second was called \"yi\", the third was called \"bing\" and so on), discussing the medical theory and acupuncture and moxibustion, hence, it was named Zhenjiu Jiayi Jing.  Zhenjiu Jiayi Jing is the earliest extant comprehensive book on the science of acupuncture and moxibustion.  Its first part deals with the viscera, channels and collaterals acupuncture points and diagnosis, and the second part is about all kinds of diseases and the therapy of acupuncture and moxibustion.  It is a sum-up of China's achievements on the science of acupuncture and moxibustion before the Jin Dynasty (265-420).

I say unlikely because at first glance, the third-century figure would seem to have little appeal as an ancestor.  Huangfu Mi is not associated with any novel discoveries or miraculous cures.  On the contrary, he suffered from congenital illness and spent most of his life in retirement in the provinces.  Indeed, modern accounts do not leave the impression that the third-century man was even much of a healer.  In his preface to the AB Classic, Huangfu Mi spoke of the extraordinary feats performed by Zhang Ji, but who were Huangfu Mis patients? Were there even patients? In short, what moved Needham, Lu, and other historians to include Huangfu Mi among the fathers of medicine? Primarily remembered as an editor, Huangfu Mi cuts an unglamorous figure in the tradition; scholars usually laud him for his meticulous editing rather than for any innovations or original treatises.  Mansvelt Pokert, for example, says that Huangfu Mi, \"revised the passages of the Nei-ching [i. e. , the Inner Classic] dealing with sinarteriology, systematically filling out and redefining the terminology and the correspondences between foramina and symptoms. \"1 Paul Unschuld, in turn, writes of the third-century man as the first editor and compiler of the canonical work.  As Unschuld puts it, \"Huangfu Mi did not add text himself; his objective was to present data he considered helpful in classical medicine. \"2 Such remarks epitomize the sentiments of twentieth-century scholars, particularly those writing in Chinese.  For his part, Chen Bangxian (see Introduction) describes Huangfu Mi as an erudite man, who studied the classics while tilling the fields.  After he became ill, Huangfu Mi purportedly turned to the study of medicine, acquiring a penetrating understanding of the classics and formulas.  It was on this basis that Huangfu \"authored the AB Classic and the Classic of the Needle, which circulated in the age. \"3 Similarly, the authors of the modern primer, Ancient Medical Texts (Yigu wen Yi Gu Wen ), refer to the AB Classic, the work that bears Huangfu Mis name and largely defines his modern reputation, as \"our nations earliest treatise on acupuncture. \" According to these authors, the AB Classic derived from earlier texts, for Huangfu Mi merely \"restored, summarized, and rearranged\" older materials. 4 Historian Liao Yuqun scarcely hides his dismay over Huangfu Mis lackluster career.  In Traditional Chinese Medicine, Liao devotes little space to Huangfu Mi and questions whether the third-century figure did much healing at all.  He writes, \"There are in fact no historical records of Huangfu Mis clinical practice and patients. \" Huangfu Mis great reputation, Liao adds, is \"entirely based\" on the AB Classic, a derivative work.  Ironically, it is Liao Yuquns unflattering depiction that makes the third-century figure look the most interesting.  Unimpressed with the earlier figure, Liao Yuqun discusses Huangfu Mis physical state of degeneration, a state that drove the third-century man to take a poisonous compound referred to as cold food powder (hanshi san Han Shi San ).  Despite clear evidence that revealed the powders dangers, Huangfu Mi failed to see the error of his ways and continued to take the drug. 5 Huangfu Mis reputation as an editor of ancient texts - or as the Analects might say, a transmitter rather than an innovator6 - seems richly deserved.  Even a cursory comparison of Huangfu Mis treatise to surviving editions of the Inner Classic suggests that the third-century man had been a bricoleur.  In composing the AB Classic, Huangfu pieced together parts of existing works, and he admitted as much: \"I have compiled and collected writings on the three sections of the Inner Classic, thus making the things described and categories cohere with each other, omitted superfluous words, exorcised the redundant, and discussed the most potent and essential parts of the text so as to arrive at a work of twenty rolls. \"7 In this regard, Huangfu Mi could not sound more like a caricature of the Chinese scholar.  Here, he did not claim to add anything new to an existing body of knowledge.  Instead, his contribution entailed filtering and purifying the records of antiquity: checking editions, excising redundancies, correcting infelicities of transmission, and bringing to the surface the underlying unity obscured by apparent inconsistencies.  Such remarks underscore the fact that Huangfu Mi saw medical knowledge in regressive terms: knowledge about the body, he thought, had to be salvaged from the scattered textual remnants of antiquity.  And for this reason, Huangfu Mi would seem to have nothing new to say.  Given all this, one is tempted to sum up Huangfu Mis contribution to medicine with words like pedantic and derivative rather than innovative, iconoclastic, or revolutionary.  While the casting of a medical ancestor as an unoriginal scholar seems predictable enough, I would argue that this way of portraying the man was hardly inevitable.  Liao Yuquns matter-of-fact discussion, which alludes to Huangfus struggles with a poisonous but addictive powder, hints of a more compelling, alternative narrative.  As an arresting chapter by literary scholar Dominik DeClercq reveals, the life of Huangfu Mi did not lack for interest, or for that matter, the stuff out of which myths were made.  In fact, the biography in the Jin History (Jinshu Jin Shu ; seventh century) - narrated largely in the first person - suggests no shortage of pathos: a man who turned away from a life of pleasure seeking and indolence after the intervention of a virtuous stepmother, only to be paralyzed with chronic illness in midlife.  At one point, the illness was so severe that Huangfu Mi was driven to the brink of suicide, a point often breezed over by modern historians.  What is more, Huangfu Mi was much more than an editor or commentator.  He could really write.  Like the other literati of his time, Huangfu Mi had a penchant for baring his breast to the world and lamenting his woes.  His corpus moreover reflects a vivid imagination and a taste for melodrama.  No alien to writing about the fantastic or strange, Huangfu Mi indulged in reciting the miraculous cures performed by great healers of earlier times, as well as recording the anomalies that portended the founding of new dynasties. 8 This chapter investigates the making of Huangfu Mis modern face.  It asks how current historians have come to see Huangfu Mi as an editor, a transmitter rather than an innovator.  By following this line of inquiry, this chapter advances our understanding of the medical archive in several ways.  To begin with, it complements the findings of the last chapter by pointing to the role that medieval editors played in mediating the contemporary historians access to the distant past.  At the same time, the discussion departs from Chapter 5 insofar as it investigates whether medieval reorderings of the archive fixed the meanings of particular figures.  By interrogating this problem, this chapter demonstrates that premodern editors and anthologists did shape the current archive with their cutting and pasting.  But such editors did not determine subsequent interpretations of the past.  As an examination of Huangfu Mis alternative history reveals, the archive contained - and still contains - the seeds for another story about the man.  A survey of medieval sources shows how Huangfu Mis image, like that of Zhang Ji, changed repeatedly over the centuries.  In the first half of the medieval period, authors had yet to identify Huangfu Mi as the prosaic editor of the AB Classic.  Instead, they focused on Huangfu Mis connection to a controversial powder: they avidly discussed his misadventures with the drug, his personal observations of the drugs side effects, and his methods for treating the symptoms of drug poisoning - methods derived from Huangfus personal experience rather than received wisdom.  One may further explain the medieval fascination with Huangfus experiments with cold food powder by the controversies that raged over the drug in the Six Dynasties and Tang.  Beginning in the eleventh century, however, a new and rather staid image of Huangfu Mi replaced the older persona.  From this time, medical anthologists overlooked Huangfu Mis association with the drug, calling attention instead to his meticulous editing.  This new image of Huangfu Mi was an artifact of controversy - but a different kind of controversy, a textual controversy.  Scholars who defended the Yellow Emperors authorship of the Basic Questions emphasized Huangfu Mis testimonies and his work on editing the classical text.  At the same time, they promoted the picture of him as a mere transmitter rather than an innovator, arguing that Huangfu had only edited the revelations of ancient sages.  Although this characterization dominated subsequent representations of the figure, stories of Huangfus struggles with cold food powder never disappeared entirely from the record.  As our final analysis will reveal, such stories were rediscovered in the twentieth century and adapted to new uses.  Setting the Stage Thanks to a lengthy biography in the Jin History, one can establish Huangfu Mis coordinates in space and time with some certainty.  We know, for example, that Huangfu Mi was born around AD 215 and died in 282. 9 He thus lived through the fall of the Han; the establishment of the Wei Wei  dynasty in 220; and the coup detat that ushered in the Jin Jin  (265-420), not to be confused with the Jurchen competitor state of the Song mentioned in Chapter 5.  (For maps of Huangfus eras, see Figures 15 and 16. ) Huangfu Mis biography sets forth the details of his whole life, beginning with a wild youth, the onset of chronic illness in midlife, his consistent refusals to take office, and the circumstances surrounding his death.

The Jin history reveals that in the eyes of his contemporaries, the third-century man was much more than a medical author.  Hailing from an illustrious clan that had produced officials since the Han dynasty - his ancestors included high-ranking administrators, important generals, and respected classicists - Huangfu Mi stood at the top of the medieval social hierarchy. 10 Predictably, such a pedigree not only afforded him a splendid classical education but also made him a prime candidate for office. 11 Huangfu Mi also did his part in raising the prestige of his clan.  Like the imperial bibliographer Liu Xiang, the third-century figure was a man of many talents, renowned for his breadth of knowledge.  According to his biographer in the Jin History, Huangfu Mi wrote on a wide array of subjects and in different genres.  He left behind a last will and testament, and wrote scores of highly regarded essays, memorials, histories, poems, autobiographies, and eulogies.  He also collected anecdotes about lofty-minded gentlemen, recluses, and virtuous women for his compendia.  Despite being concerned with subjects other than healing, two of these works, which bear on our discussion, require explanation.  The first is the Genealogical Records of Emperors and Kings (Diwang shiji Di Wang Shi Ji ), an influential work that traced the origins of the various ruling houses back to ancient sages.  The second is \"Rejecting Advice\" (Shiquan lun Shi Quan Lun ), an essay that explored the question whether subjects (such as Huangfu Mi) were morally obligated to serve in office, particularly in cases in which the ruler was a tyrant. 12 Besides these, a sizeable portion of Huangfu Mis medical writings reaches the modern reader as compilations of different dates.  Many of his ruminations on drug formulas - once set forth in titles such as the Various Formulas Relied Upon by Huangfu Shian (Huangfu Shian yi zhufang zhuan Huang Fu Shi An Yi Zhu Fang Zhuan ) and a Treatise on Cold Food Powder Formulas (Lun hanshisan fang Lun Han Shi San Fang ) - now survive in large fragments within medieval compilations. 13 Such compilations include the Treatise on the Origins of the Various Illnesses (Zhubing yuanhou lun Zhu Bing Yuan Hou Lun ) by Chao Yuanfang Chao Yuan Fang  (fl.  605-616). 14 In addition, fragments of Huangfu Mis corpus appear in a Japanese anthology, the Essential Formulas of Medicine (Ishinpo Yi Xin Fang ) by Tanba Yasuyori Dan Bo Kang Lai  (912-95).  Although it served as the basis of the imperial medical curriculum in the Tang dynasty,15 the current version of Huangfu Mis AB Classic is late; it derives from the eleventh-century edition published by the same members of the Imperial Bureau of Editing Texts that produced the mass print edition of the Cold Damage Disorders. 16 In terms of content, the AB Classic was a rearrangement of the materials found in two of the three current editions of the canonical Inner Classic: the Basic Questions and the Classic of the Divine Pivot (Lingshu jing Ling Shu Jing ). 17 The derivative quality of the AB Classic was something that Huangfu Mi acknowledged.  In its preface, he explained that he collected and used materials from an existing work on acupuncture called the Bright Hall (Mingtang Ming Tang ).  As we shall see, this remark would acquire special significance in the eleventh century, when healers and scholars reimagined Huangfu Mis contributions to the medical tradition.  Finally, a word about cold food powder, which I will reference repeatedly: the name of the drug is derived from its method of administration, as medieval elites often took the drug with cold food.  The drug was also known by other names: the \"five minerals\" (wushi Wu Shi ), \"rejuvenator\" (gengsheng Geng Sheng ), and \"life preserver\" (huming Hu Ming ).  The name \"five minerals\" suggests that the drug was a mix of minerals - principals of Chinese pharmacopeia and mainstays in elixirs, including halloysite (chishi zhi Chi Shi Zhi ), quartz (baishi zhi Bai Shi Zhi /baishi ying Bai Shi Ying ), fluoritum (zishi zhi Zi Shi Zhi  / zishi ying Zi Shi Ying ), stalactite (zhongru shi Zhong Ru Shi ), and sulfur (liuhuang Liu Huang ). 18 By Huangfu Mis account, the drug appeared sometime in the Han dynasty and had even been used by the great Zhang Ji before falling into less able hands. 19 A libertine had discovered that the powder enhanced his sexual potency, and so the drug became popular overnight in the Han dynasty capital, with other wellborn men aping the practice.  Making matters worse, the drug was soon used for all purposes: its potency relieved people who had long suffered from illness within the space of a couple days.  Yet the powder also harbored hidden risks.  As Huangfu Mi wrote, the common run of men \"were overly fond of immediate gratification and oblivious to the calamities that would later befall them. \"20 Where Did the Transmitter Go? Our sources and setting defined, we return to the central argument, that Huangfu Mis portrait was hardly static through the ages, but bears the doctoring and decoupage of later scholars who retouched him to personify their own scholastic persuasions.  Our survey of archival sources indicates that Huangfu Mis medieval persona was very different from its present reincarnate.  Authors before the eleventh century downplayed his exegetical work.  Instead, they highlighted the figures disastrous experiments with cold food powder.  The interest in Huangfu Mis misadventures with that medicament owed much to the controversies in medieval circles about the substance.  Viewed from this perspective, the prominent association between Huangfu Mi and cold food powder reflected as much later medical debates about drugs as the mans self-fashioning.  Huangfu Mi was certainly a ubiquitous figure in the early medieval record - almost as ubiquitous, in fact, as Zhang Ji.  Curiously, the first writers to mention the man said little about his editing.  This is not to say that such writers were ignorant of Huangfus interest in the curative arts, as such an interest was in fact noted early on.  Take the annals written by a younger contemporary of Huangfu Mi, \"[Huangfu Mi] was stricken by a wind that caused paralysis, and so he became knowledgeable about the classics and formulas. \"21 Worth noting here is the fact that the chronicler made no mention of Huangfus editorial work.  In this regard, he was not alone; the catalogues of the Liang Liang  (502-557) and Sui dynasties mentioned Huangfu Mis works on drug formulary but ignored his role in compiling the AB Classic. 22 What is more, they listed this last work without an author.  Huangfu Mis biographer in the Jin History was also silent about the mans efforts to edit older medical texts. 23 The weakness of Huangfu Mis connection to the AB Classic is surprising, particularly considering how often medical authors quoted from his corpus.  Scores of references to Huangfu Mi survive in the vast medical compendia of the Sui and Tang dynasties.  Yet, these only mentioned Huangfu Mis name in connection to cold food powder.  The Origins of the Various Illnesses provides one such example.  Nowhere in this voluminous work did its compiler, Chao Yuanfang, relate Huangfu Mis hand in compiling the AB Classic.  Similarly, the Japanese compendium, the Essentials of Medical Formulas, referenced Huangfu Mi several dozen times - but once again, primarily in relation to drug formulary (we will discuss the one exception).  The Secrets of the Outer Terrace of Wang Tao provides a different kind of example.  Unlike other medieval authors, Wang quoted liberally from the AB Classic - all together more than a dozen times.  Yet interestingly, the association with Huangfu Mi remained weak, as Wang linked Huangfu Mis name to this text only once. 24 Rather than presenting him as an editor of old works, medieval authors instead left the impression that Huangfu Mis chief contribution lay elsewhere, in drug formulary and cold food powder.  Such sources suggested a figure deeply knowledgeable about, if not obsessed by, that medicament.  This is evident from the copious references to Huangfu Mis explanations of cold food powder poisoning: the anguish, chills, fevers, pain, tenderness, insomnia, and suicidal thoughts that manifested the drugs deleterious effects. 25 In addition, the authors of such compendia related Huangfu Mis admonitions about the drug, repeating his description of cases when men lost their lives or minds through careless administration of the substance: \"Pei Xiu Pei Xiu  (224-271) of Hedong He Dong  had taken the drug without moderation, and although he had the veneration of one who occupied the offices of the Three Excellencies, after he became deranged, he never regained his wits again. \"26 Not content with citing just one of Huangfu Mis remarks, the medieval editors also included the other cases of cold food powder poisoning described by the third-century man: \"This is what had happened to my younger paternal cousin Changhu Chang Hu , whose tongue shrank and entered his throat.  Wang Liangfu Wang Liang Fu  of Donghai Dong Hai  commandery suffered from an abscess that sunk into his back; the flesh along the spine of Xin Changxu Xin Chang Xu  of Longxi Long Xi  festered; and among my maternal cousins, six of them have died from the effects of cold food powder. \"27 The Huangfu Mi of medieval compendia also offers a contrast with the modern image in another respect: whereas modern scholars, especially Liao Yuqun, treat Huangfu Mi as an armchair physician, medieval authors presented the third-century figure as a highly effective healer.  Indeed, the presentation of Huangfu Mi in these medieval compendia invites comparisons with Sima Qians Granary Master (see Chapter 3).  Like the Han healer, Huangfu Mi made no bones about announcing his track record of success with treating victims of cold food powder poisoning.  Just as Sima Qian highlighted the Granary Masters successful prognoses, medieval editors displayed Huangfu Mis boasts about his expertise.  In addition, Huangfu Mi, who was something of a gossip, revealed the names of the patients he treated, calling attention to their prominent stations in life and the role that he played in their recovery.  For example, he advertised his success in treating a governor, who had \"sunken deep into an illness caused by cold food powder poisoning. \" Apparently, the governor was not alone in seeking Huangfus help.  Prior to that time, Huangfu Mi had used his drugs to stop another mans suffering and so that man recovered fully.  As the healer explained somewhat immodestly, his efforts bore fruit; or in his own words, \"from these cases, I became well known. \"28 Unlike modern descriptions of the man, which treat him as a transmitter of ancient wisdom, medieval sources depicted Huangfu Mi as an iconoclast - a figure whose knowledge of drug formulary stemmed not from ancient texts or authoritative figures but rather from the testimony of his eyes and ears.  This is not to say that medieval authors thought of Huangfu Mi as an unlettered man, however.  Through quotations, they showed him discussing different opinions regarding the origins of cold food powder, which he attributed to Zhang Ji.  They provide a passage in which Huangfu Mi even explained the works that he consulted. 29 Oddly enough, Huangfu Mi gave earlier figures, including Zhang Ji, no credit for his treatment methods.  On the contrary, Huangfu went to lengths to stress his own ingenuity.  \"All of these methods for saving the patient,\" he wrote, \"have been things that I have personally experienced - having verified these methods through trial, I did not hear about them from anyone else. \"30 More surprising still, Huangfu even asserted that his personal experience provided the source of his knowledge about healing: \"It is only those who have 'broken their arm three times [i. e. , that are seasoned] that become healers, and it is not the case that one is born with knowledge, as trial and verifications are the sequence for learning. \"31 The medieval penchant for treating Huangfu Mi as an innovator is most obvious from the descriptions of the mans struggles with the drug.  Sometime in his mid-thirties, Huangfu suffered from a debilitating bout of arthritis, an illness that would cause him to take cold food powder.  As he explained it, the cure turned out to be worse than the actual illness.  Unable to eat or drink and suffering from intense pain, Huangfu Mi was driven to the brink of suicide.  By his own account, he grasped a knife with the intention of stabbing himself, only to be saved by members of the household who restrained him.  After this close call, Huangfu took matters into his own hands.  \"I then withdrew,\" he told readers, \"and reflected on the matter by myself. \" He then deduced that he would have to force himself to consume food and drink, and what was more, to plunge himself into ice water.  By his account, this method, the hallmark of his treatment for cold food powder poisoning, proved effective.  Huangfus suffering thereupon came to an end. 32 In large part, the strong association between Huangfu Mi and the powder reflected his self-presentation.  Judging from what survives of his corpus, Huangfu wrote prolifically about cold food powder - and not merely in works concerned with drug formulary and medicine; the subject of his illness and cold food powder also consumed his writings on statecraft.  Consider one of Huangfus memorials, composed between 266 and 268, which dwelled on his misadventures with the mineral compound; an excerpt is translated in the following text based on Dominik DeClercq: Jiu Ying Du Ji , Qu Ban Bu Ren , You Jiao Pian Xiao , Shi You Jiu Zai .  You Fu Han Shi Yao , Wei Cuo Jie Du , Xin Ku Tu Du , Yu Jin Qi Nian .  Long Dong Luo Tan Shi Bing , Dang Shu Fan Men , Jia Yi Ke Ni , Huo Ruo Wen Nue , Huo Lei Shang Han , Fu Qi Liu Zhong , Si Zhi Suan Zhong .  Yu Jin Kun Lie , Jiu Ming Hu Xi , Fu Xiong Jian Chu , Qi Xi Chang Jue .  Yang Po Tian Wei , Fu Yu Jiu Dao , Suo Ku Jia Yan , Bu Ren Jin Lu , Wei Shen Dai Zui , Fu Zhen  Tan Xi .   I have long suffered from a serious illness, which, for nineteen years now, has left half my body numb and my right foot smaller than the other.  Moreover, I took cold food medicine for it but erred in the dosage, which caused me bitterness and acrimonious suffering, now seven years ago.  In midwinter I stripped naked and ate ice, all the while feeling hot, vexed, and dejected.  In addition, I was afflicted with coughs and reversal; at one moment I suffered from fevers and then chills, and at another, the illness belonged to the category of cold damage; the floating qi flowed down to swell my feet and my four limbs became sore and fatigued.  At that point I was so debilitated that I could only save myself by swallowing and spitting - the family elders saw me and came outside, my wife and children bade farewell to me forever.  I looked up to implore the majesty of Heaven, and supporting myself with difficulty, set out for the road which, however, only exacerbated the pain; it was beyond my strength to move forward and I gave up, waiting for the worst to happen.  I leaned against my pillow and sighed. 33 The passage, which describes the circumstances that drove Huangfu Mi to administer cold food powder, bears explanation.  As DeClercq points out, Huangfu Mi wrote about his physical suffering on the occasion of declining official summons.  The Jin court had just experienced a coup detat.  As the new ruler was eager to bolster his legitimacy by surrounding himself with men of renown, he naturally summoned Huangfu Mi, a leading luminary of the age and the scion of a great clan. 34 Huangfu Mi thus found himself in a quandary.  He realized that working for this new tyrant could be fatal if the regime was short lived, because he ran the risk of being executed as a traitor.  Snubbing the new ruler, however, was also a bad option, as it might incur equally dire consequences.  The best out for Huangfu was thus to plead fragility due to sickness, and he did - with considerable panache.  Motives notwithstanding, the reasons why Huangfu Mis misadventures with the powder came to dominate later representations are clear.  The story - rendered in Huangfus beautiful prose - supplied a vivid account of the ravages of illness.  No other early figure in the classical medical tradition, in fact, claimed such a dismal failure of treatment.  The story was thus both distinctive and memorable.  All this is important when one considers the role of memory in early and medieval China.  In such eras, readers did not only write, copy, and read stories quietly, but more often than not, they also intoned and delivered them orally. 35 The more distinctive the tale, the better the chances that it would capture the imaginations of its audiences and be preserved.  Huangfu Mis account of his illness moreover found its way into a highly visible source, his biography in the official history, or the standard reference for his life and works.  All of this, in turn, further reinforced Huangfus association with the powder.  One can also account for his association with the powder in terms of the medieval fascination with the substance.  While scholars sometimes regard the powder merely as a third-century fad, members of the medieval elite, in fact, continuously ingested, discussed, and debated the powder seven centuries after Huangfu Mis day. 36 In addition, the controversies surrounding cold food powder - its origins, proper application, and, above all, its safety - also deepened the association between Huangfu Mi and the compound.  Opponents of the powder asserted that the substance was too dangerous to be taken under almost any circumstances, citing the many adverse effects associated with it.  The great Tang medical authority, Sun Simiao, for example, characterized the powder as nothing less than a \"fearsome poison. \" Sun also attributed the popularity of the drug to the lechery of his contemporaries: \"There are also those with an insatiable desire to eat the five minerals [i. e. , cold food powder] due to seeking the pleasures of the bedchamber. \"37 In contrast, defenders of cold food powder went to lengths to minimize the pitfalls of the drug.  Such defenders instead highlighted the virtues of the medicament.  Wrote one author, \"The powder is good for extending the lifespan and nourishing the vitality; it also harmonizes the nature and principle. \"38 Although such defenders emphasized the potential virtues of the drug, they also acknowledged the risks involved in administering it.  In this connection, one defender asserted that the compound was too tricky for mediocre healers, or those of \"middling ability,\" to handle. 39 \"Fatalities reflect mistakes in administering the drug,\" one said, \"so the fault does not lie with the powder. \"40 Interestingly, it was the proponents of cold food powder who found the testimonies of Huangfu Mi to be of the greatest use.  Such proponents marshaled the mans testimonies, particularly when arguing that fatalities reflected errors in administration rather than the intrinsic properties of the drug.  They highlighted Huangfus admonitions against using the drug casually or, as many did, with reckless abandon.  In this connection, one proponent even singled out Huangfu Mi for praise as a \"fine talent,\" while noting that his views about the proper uses of the powder were at odds with another authority.  Whereas the third-century man had deemed it appropriate to cool the body, the author noted, others had urged patients to do the opposite and to apply heat.  For such an author, the differences in opinion underscored the fact that the drug should only be taken by someone with a thorough understanding of the drugs intricacies. 41 Medieval sources thus offer a different picture of Huangfu Mi than the one found in modern histories.  Whereas modern historians remember the third-century figure primarily as an editor, medieval writers often depicted him as a victim of cold food powder poisoning, an effective healer, and an innovator.  One might even argue that this medieval image of Huangfu Mi largely reflected later controversies about the powder.  In such debates, Huangfu Mis testimonies became a central rallying point, as defenders used him to argue that the powder was not inherently deadly, and killed only men who did not understand the drug.  For them, Huangfus experiences exemplified the trickiness of administering the drug, which defenders emphasized should be used only by the most skillful of healers.  Given that medieval elites debated the virtues and risks of the powder, it need not surprise us that it was the image of Huangfu Mi plunging into ice baths that caught the attention of audiences.  The Emergence of the PEDANT We have seen Huangfu Mis other face, but when did the mans image begin to change into that of the pedant - and, more importantly, why did it change? In other words, how does one account for the prosaic image of the classical scholar eclipsing the more arresting vision of a sick man, experimenting with a potent but dangerous cure? To answer these questions, one must first establish when this shift occurred.  As I shall demonstrate, this new image of Huangfu Mi became prominent after the mid-eleventh century, following the publication of the AB Classics print edition.  Such a shift, I propose, is best explained by the controversy that raged over the Basic Questions - a controversy that not only brought heightened attention to Huangfu Mis efforts to compile the AB Classic (a mere \"edition\" of the Basic Questions), but also necessitated his transformation from an innovator into a transmitter.  Eighth-century authors were the first to refer to Huangfu Mi as an editor.  One scholar, Yang Xuancao Yang Yuan Cao  (sixth through seventh century), described the Bright Hall, one of Huangfu Mis sources for his acupuncture treatise, as the \"orthodox classic\" of the Yellow Emperor.  Yang also paid homage to Huangfu Mis exegetical prowess, writing that the third-century figure had been a \"great talent of the Jin court, who possessed a penetrating knowledge of the medical arts. \" By Yangs account, Huangfu Mi had used this wealth of knowledge to \"compile the AB Classic, thereby setting forth the three parts [i. e. , of the Inner Classic]. \"42 Although it anticipated later treatments of the figure, Yangs characterization of Huangfu Mi was not influential, at least not overnight.  Repeated only a handful of times over the next few centuries, such a characterization did little to alter Huangfu Mis image as a proponent of cold food powder. 43 Instead, the connections between Huangfu Mi and the AB Classic only became pronounced in late Tang.  The authors of the catalogues in the Old Tang History (Jiu Tangshu Jiu Tang Shu ; 945) and New Tang History (Xin Tangshu Xin Tang Shu ; 1060) corroborated the observations of Yang.  They listed Huangfu Mi as the compiler of a text called the Yellow Emperors Classic of Acupuncture in Three Parts (Huangdi sanbu zhenjing Huang Di San Bu Zhen Jing ), which was another name for the AB Classic. 44 One must wait until the eleventh century, however, before we find clear signs that medieval authors preferred to present Huangfu Mi as an editor.  Jin Huang Fu Mi  .  Bo Zong Dian Ji .  Bai Jia Zhi Yan .  Chen Jing Gua Yu .   You Gao Shang Zhi Zhi .  De Feng Bei .  Yin Er Xue Yi .  Xi Lan Jing Fang .  Sui Zhen Zhi Miao .  Qu Huang Di Su Wen , Zhen Jing , Ming Tang San Bu Zhi Shu .  Zhuan Wei Zhen Jiu Jing Shi Er Juan .   Huangfu Mi of the Jin was broadly learned in the canonical works and the words of the hundred masters.  He was deeply quiescent, had few desires, and possessed lofty goals.  Because he fell ill with a paralyzing wind, Huangfu Mi took up the study of medicine, reading and becoming familiar with the classics and formulas.  He subsequently arrived at their supreme subtlety.  He took three texts, the Basic Questions of the Yellow Emperor, the Classic of Needling, and the Bright Hall, and edited them into the Classic of Needling and Moxibustion of twelve rolls. 47 One must wait until the eleventh century, however, before we find clear signs that medieval authors preferred to present Huangfu Mi as an editor.  45 The preference for this image is on full display in the Song postface to the AB Classic, which the members of the Imperial Bureau of Medicine wrote in 1069.  46 Such bureau members described the third-century figure accordingly: Although they depicted Huangfu Mis brush with illness as his motivation for studying the healing arts, the bureau members omitted his misadventures with cold food powder.  Instead, they focused on his editing of ancient medical works and his knowledge of the classics.  While one might be tempted to chalk up their silence about cold food powder to ignorance, the evidence suggests the contrary.  The bureau members also published a definitive edition of the Treatises on the Origins of the Various Illnesses - the medical compendia that devoted so much space to Huangfu Mis writings on the powder. 48 Their silence, in other words, reflected choice.  The presentation of Huangfu Mi as an editor has been undeniably influential.  In later periods of Chinese history, authors seemed to be less taken with Huangfus association with cold food powder than with his contributions in the AB Classic.  In the Discourses on Medicine (twelfth through thirteenth century), Huangfu Mi appeared as a classical scholar who transmitted the learning of the Yellow Emperor and compiled his revelations into the AB Classic, rather than a man with an addiction. 49 The author never actually mentions Huangfu Mis extensive writings on cold food powder, despite devoting a section to the medicament. 50 Similarly, the Great Compendium of the Ancient and Modern Medical Tradition (Gujin yitong daquan Gu Jin Yi Tong Da Quan ; sixteenth century) treated the AB Classic as Huangfu Mis main achievement; quoting verbatim the descriptions in the Song edition of the AB Classic. 51 The depiction of the third-century man in the Complete Records of Medicine (Yibu quanlu Yi Bu Quan Lu ; seventeenth century), an anthology that drew upon a variety of earlier sources, is even more telling.  The anthologist explained Huangfus decision to study medicine as a response to illness, \"Huangfu Mi studied the primary and secondary analyses so as to relieve the distress of illness. \" He also downplayed Huangfu Mis connection to cold food powder, eulogizing instead his contributions to the AB Classic.  Still, the author clearly made use of Huangfu Mis biography in the Jin History, a source that detailed the symptoms the man suffered as a result of ingesting the powder. 52 So how do we explain the fact that authors after the eleventh century remembered Huangfu Mi largely for the AB Classic? In this connection, allow me to begin with a disquieting possibility, one hard to ignore in light of my findings for Chapter 5 - to wit, the story of Huangfu Mi compiling the AB Classic is spurious.  Perhaps we do not hear of Huangfu Mis editing of ancient medical texts before the eighth century because he did no such thing? Adding to our suspicions is the fact that no trace of the preface survives in works predating the mid-eleventh century.  As a result, one wonders whether the preface, the only definitive link between the AB Classic and the third-century figure, might have been the creation of Song editors, who exercised a considerable amount of creative license when editing the work.  While worth taking seriously, this possibility is not the best explanation of the change in Huangfu Mis image in the Song dynasty.  To begin with, the fact that the Liang and Sui catalogues did not list Huangfu Mi as the compiler of the AB Classic is unsurprising; the names of editors were often omitted from medieval catalogues. 53 More importantly, Huangfu Mis other writings support his authorship of the preface to the AB Classic.  Take Huangfu Mis famous claim that the Yellow Emperor and other ancient sages composed the Basic Questions.  This, Huangfu Mi asserted not once but thrice - in two other works, the Genealogical Records and \"Rejecting Advice\" as well as the AB Classic. 54 In \"Rejecting Advice,\" he even recited the history of the curative arts: Ruo Huang Di Chuang Zhi Yu Jiu Jing  Yes, the Yellow Emperor created the Nine Classics.  Qi Bo Pou Fu Yi Juan Chang  And Qibo cut through the abdomen to cleanse the intestines.  Bian Que Zao Guo Er Shi Qi  Bian Que went to Guo and revived a corpse.  Wen Zhi Xun Ming Yu Qi Wang  Wen Zhi sacrificed his life for the King of Qi.  Yi He Xian Shu Yu Qin Jin  Attendant He manifested his arts in the states of Qin and Jin.  Cang Gong Fa Mi Yu Han Huang  The Granary Master expounded on his secrets for the Han sovereign.  Hua Tuo Cun Jing Yu Du Shi  Hua Tuo preserved his essence with techniques known only to him.  Zhong Jing Chui Miao Yu Ding Fang  Zhongjing [i. e. , Zhang Ji] bequeathed the mysteries of medicine in his set formulas.  Tu Hen Sheng Bu Feng Hu Ruo Ren  I only regret that in this life I will not meet men such as these. 55 The recitation should look familiar.  There is the same historical progression that appears in the AB Classic; Huangfu began here with the ancient sages of high antiquity before moving through successive stages of the past down to the present.  Likewise, many of the figures were the same, with minor variation (Huangfu substituted the legendary minister Wen Zhi Wen Zhi , who cured his lord by infuriating him, for another figure of comparable status, Yi Yin).  Such differences aside, readers familiar with the AB Classic will recognize many of the same names: the Yellow Emperor, Attendant He, Bian Que, the Granary Master, Hua Tuo, and Zhang Ji.  To explain the changing representations of Huangfu Mi, we are instead better served by looking at the shifting priorities of healers and medical authors.  In part, the surge of interest in Huangfu Mis exegetical contributions undoubtedly reflected the declining popularity of cold food powder.  Although it never disappeared entirely from the Chinese pharmacopeia, the popularity of the powder waned in Song times. 56 Consequently, one would expect that healers would have had to associate Huangfu Mi with other achievements; otherwise he would have faded from the history of medicine entirely.  Perhaps the single most important factor that explains Huangfu Mis changing face was the controversy over the Basic Questions.  As we will see, scholars from the Song dynasty began to emphasize Huangfu Mis editorial skills precisely at the moment in which the authenticity of the Basic Questions was seriously called into doubt.  For defenders of the Basic Questions, it became critical that Huangfu Mi appear as a transmitter, the preserver of ancient revelations rather than an innovator - or worst still, a clever forger.  Before explaining how such a controversy was responsible for the shifting presentation of Huangfu Mi, I must provide some background.  Although not new, doubts about the provenance of the Basic Questions were especially pronounced in the eleventh century, when important scholars and officials questioned the Yellow Emperors authorship of the classic. 57 Such men included a long list of scholarly luminaries.  One of the most influential minds of the eleventh century, statesman and literatus Cheng Yi Cheng Yi  (1033-1107), for example, openly voiced his doubts about the provenance of the Basic Questions, arguing that it was written at the end of the Warring States. 58 Such skepticism was shared by others, including Sima Guang Si Ma Guang  (1019-86), another great eleventh-century statesman and literatus. 59 For his part, Sima Guang paid his compliments to the learning presented in the Basic Questions.  But when asked if the text was the work of the Yellow Emperor, he rejected the possibility out of hand.  \"When the Yellow Emperor was governing the realm,\" he wrote, \"he was in the Bright Hall busy receiving commands all day, and so how could he be discussing medicaments and needles with Qibo?\" The Basic Questions, Sima Guang added, must have been the work of men of the Warring States or Qin, who assumed the name of the Yellow Emperor in order to win credibility. 60 To see how the controversy over the Basic Questions affected Huangfu Mis image, we should go to the postface of the Song edition of the AB Classic.  Interestingly enough, the Song bureau members said little about the AB Classic in the postface, choosing instead to emphasize that the Basic Questions was the work of ancient sages.  \"There have been some,\" the bureau members complained, \"who say that the three parts of the Inner Classic - the Basic Questions, the Classic of Needling, and the Bright Hall - are not the writings of the Yellow Emperor. \"61 Readers familiar with the conventions of the era will notice the omission of names - specifically, those of Cheng Yi and Sima Guang.  Such an omission must have been deliberate.  Mentioning that the greatest minds and most famous officials of the age thought differently would not have helped the bureau members! Instead, they focused on the one literatus who agreed with them, Huangfu Mi.  In many ways, the bureau members choice to home in on Huangfu Mi made sense.  To begin with, it was in the AB Classic that Huangfu Mi expressed his belief that the Yellow Emperor had written the Basic Questions and other important works.  And Huangfu Mi furthermore claimed in the preface to have been nothing more than an editor, who collected and rearranged the revelations of the ancient sages. 62 What is more, the third-century man had a sterling reputation as a great scholar of antiquity, which undoubtedly lent cachet to the bureau members argument.  As they reminded their readers, \"None of the ancient classicists over the ages have come up to Huangfu Mi. \"63 In this regard, the Song bureau members were not alone.  One finds similar appeals to Huangfu Mis authority in the Discourses on Medicine, where the author summoned Huangfus testimonies when making a case for the ancient provenance of the Basic Questions. 64 Other defenders used Huangfu Mi in a more subtle fashion, while acknowledging the arguments of the opposition.  For example, Lu Fu, discussed briefly in Chapter 5, not only acknowledged that the text was the product of disparate hands, but also of different eras.  Lu even went so far as pointing out parts of the Basic Questions that were spurious - forgeries interpolated into the main text by a deceitful Tang commentator.  Yet to his mind, such insertions did not detract from the importance of the work, as the Basic Questions still preserved the revelations of the ancient sages.  In this regard, Lu noted, the medical canon was like one of the ritual classics, which had only taken its present form in the Han dynasty.  Nevertheless, the text preserved the teachings of earlier ages, for it transmitted the wisdom of Confucius.  According to Lu, the case of the Basic Questions was no different, as Huangfu Mi and later scholars had merely rearranged older materials that expressed the sages subtle understandings of the body: the workings of the yin and yang, the Five Phases, the location of the acupoints, and so forth.  Although Lu Fus argument was far more sophisticated than those of the Song bureau members, there were certain commonalities.  Lu also shared the Song bureau members view of Huangfu Mi as a transmitter and editor, a status that set Huangfu Mi apart from other scholars.  Whereas Lu branded one Tang commentator as a forger for adding new material into the Basic Questions, he saw Huangfu Mi as the faithful custodian of the sages legacies. 65 Our discussion thus suggests that the present image of Huangfu Mi evolved over time.  Whereas in the Six Dynasties, Sui, and Tang, Huangfu Mi was seen as an effective healer, famed for his innovations in treating cold food powder poisoning; by the eleventh century, Huangfu had acquired the more prosaic image of an editor.  One may furthermore explain this change by a host of factors, the most important being the debates about the Basic Questions.  In such debates, the defenders of the Yellow Emperors authorship marshaled Huangfu Mis testimonies in their favor.  In addition, Huangfu Mis reputation as a classical scholar and transmitter played a critical role in arguments concerning the ancient origins of the medical canon.  In an era when critics were quick to accuse others of surreptitiously introducing new content under the guise of preserving or discovering the lost revelations of antiquity, the fact that Huangfu Mi had nothing \"new\" to say proved to be a virtue.

After an outstanding student career at the Conservatoire de Paris he played in orchestras in France and the US before the Second World War.  After the war he became a well-known soloist, playing in countries round the globe.  He taught at conservatoires in France, Germany and China, and gave televised masterclasses in England.  He was particularly associated with the solo part in Richard Strauss's Don Quixote, cello concertos by Elgar and others, and Bach's Cello Suites. Tortelier was born in Paris, the son of Joseph Tortelier and his wife Marguerite, nee Boura.  Joseph, who came from a family with Breton roots, was a menuisier-ebeniste - a carpenter-cabinet-maker - in Montmartre. Tortelier's mother had a particular love of the cello and he began to play the instrument when he was six. His general education was at the Ecole Lucien Lafflessele, and from the age of nine he studied the cello with Louis Feuillard. At the age of 12 Tortelier entered the Conservatoire de Paris, where he studied the cello with Gerard Hekking.  While a student he earned an income in a trio playing accompaniments to silent films. He won the conservatoire's first prize when he was 16, playing the Elgar Cello Concerto, and then he studied harmony and composition under Jean Gallon. He made his professional debut in 1931 at the age of 17, as soloist in Lalo's Cello Concerto with the Orchestre Lamoureux. In 1935 Tortelier joined the Monte-Carlo Philharmonic Orchestra as first cellist and played with them until 1937.  He gave performances under Bruno Walter and Arturo Toscanini, and played the solo part in Richard Strauss's Don Quixote conducted by the composer. In 1937 Tortelier accepted an invitation from Serge Koussevitzky to join the Boston Symphony Orchestra.  He remained until the 1939-40 season.  He was in Paris during the Second World War, teaching at the Conservatoire.  He had a short-lived marriage to Madeleine Gaston, which ended in divorce in 1944. After the war he was principal cellist of the Orchestre de la Societe des Concerts du Conservatoire in 1946-47.  In 1946 he married a cello pupil, Maud Monique Martin, with whom he had three children, all of whom became musicians: Yan Pascal, a violinist and subsequently a conductor; Maria de la Pau, a pianist; and Pomona, a cellist. In 1947 Tortelier's international career as a soloist began in Berlin and Amsterdam. After a concert in the latter city, conducted by Sir Thomas Beecham, at which Tortelier again played the solo part in Don Quixote, Beecham invited him to reprise his performance with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (RPO) at a festival of Strauss's music in London, in the presence of the composer. Within days Tortelier gave a recital with Gerald Moore at the Wigmore Hall and recorded the Strauss piece with Beecham and the RPO. After the recital, the music critic of The Times wrote that Tortelier showed himself to be \"an artist of great distinction, whose playing combined technical mastery with fine musicianship throughout a programme including works by Bach, Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, Debussy, and virtuoso show-pieces\". He added: By virtue of phrasing and variety of tone M.  Tortelier made unaccompanied Bach come alive as few cellists succeed in doing, and his animated interpretation of Debussy's frequently abused sonata brought home its real significance in a way that will not quickly be forgotten.  During his subsequent career Tortelier played throughout Europe, the Americas, Australia, North Africa, Israel, the USSR and Japan, but Britain remained central to his career, and most of his recordings over the next four decades were made there.  He found the English baffling in their undemonstrative feelings, but he was fond of them: \"I cannot speak of the English without emotion.  I owe them everything in terms of my career\". He was less at home with Americans, whom he found friendly but lacking in real love. In 1950 Tortelier was asked by Pablo Casals to play as the principal cellist in the Prades Festival Orchestra; out of respect for Casals, Tortelier agreed. [n 1] He later said, \"I have played for Toscanini and Karajan, but I never felt with any conductor what I felt with Casals\". More than any other cellist it was Casals who influenced him the most.  Tortelier said that there was a spiritual quality in the older man's playing: \"one never thought that Casals was playing the cello; he was playing music\". Nonetheless, Tortelier gained technical insights from Casals, particularly the latter's flexible use of the left hand on the fingerboard and his assertive phrasing and articulation. He also absorbed Casals's approach to intonation, subtly sharpening or flattening the pitch of notes for the best harmonic effect. Casals said of Tortelier's mastery of the cello, \"When you play you make it talk\". Although he was not Jewish (he was an agnostic Roman Catholic) Tortelier was inspired by the ideals of the founders of the newly formed state of Israel in 1948, and in 1955-56 he lived with his wife and children in the kibbutz Ma'abarot, near Haifa. During this period he made his debut as a conductor, with the Israel Philharmonic. Tortelier's international career continued into his seventies.  At a concert to mark his 75th birthday he was joined by colleagues including his friend Mstislav Rostropovich, who conducted the Saint-Saens A-minor concerto with Tortelier as soloist and later in the concert joined him as fellow soloist in a composition of Tortelier's own, the \"Valse, alla Maud\". Tortelier died of a heart attack on 18 December 1990 at the age of 76 in the domaine of Villarceaux, Yvelines, near Paris. At a concert the following June to celebrate his life and work, Yehudi Menuhin, Sir Charles Groves and Yan-Pascal Tortelier conducted, and the cellists included Maud Martin Tortelier, Janos Starker and two of Tortelier's former students, Arto Noras and Raphael Sommer. Tortelier thought it important for executant musicians to write music, because he felt it enabled him to approach even repertory works as, to some extent, an act of re-creation: When I ask famous artists why they don't compose they invariably say they don't have the talent.  But that is something that develops.  They think the first piece they write should be their masterpiece.  When it isn't - and it never is - they stop trying\".  His compositions include a concerto for two cellos and orchestra (1950), a solo cello suite in D, and two sonatas for cello and piano.  He wrote a set of variations for cello and orchestra (May Music Save Peace).  He also wrote a symphony, the Israel Symphony.  Several of his compositions were included at a special concert to mark his 75th birthday at the Royal Festival Hall in 1989, in which his wife and son joined in his celebrations. He twice edited the Bach Cello Suites; his first version was published by Augener in 1961, and the second by Galliard in 1966.[n 2] Tortelier's students included Noras, Sommer, Jacqueline du Pre, Anne Gastinel and Nathan Waks. He was a professor at the Conservatoire de Paris (1956-69), the Folkwang Hochschule in Essen, Germany (1969-1975), and the Conservatoire Pierre Cochereau, Nice (1978-80).  He was also an honorary professor at the Central Conservatoire in Beijing. In the 1960s and 1970s he gave a series of master classes which were recorded and broadcast on TV by the BBC.  The Times said of them, \"he was the first musician to popularise the master class on BBC television.  With his deep-set, expressive eyes, his unruly mop of white hair and broken but articulate English he captivated his audience as much as his pupils\".  His physical resemblance to the traditional drawings of Cervantes's Don Quixote was remarked on. Pursuing his encouragement of rising talent, Tortelier was artistic director and panel chairman for Britain's first major cello competition, held in Bristol in 1975.  20 competitors from 12 countries took part, and the gala concert featured the premiere of Tortelier's own Concerto for Two Cellos, performed by the composer and his wife, with their son conducting. If Tortelier had to play or tune a violin he would do so holding it vertically, like a miniature cello.  After he tuned his son's violin thus on one occasion, the young Yan Pascal commented that it did not sound as good when tuned upright as when tuned in its normal horizontal position. Tortelier concurred, and further consideration of the point led him to develop a new kind of endpin, hinged to bring the cello down from nearly vertical to a slope, so that the instrument vibrates more freely, giving greater projection of its sound. This suited some cellists more than others, and according to Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians is \"not widely used\". Tortelier was an honorary member of the Royal Academy of Music in London, held honorary degrees from three English universities, and was a Commander of the Order of the Lion of Finland. A street in the Batignolles-Monceau, the 17th arrondissement of Paris, is named in his honour. Tortelier's extensive discography includes two sets of the Bach Cello Suites, the first made in Paris in 1960 and the second in London in 1982.  He recorded Don Quixote twice: first with Beecham and the RPO in 1947 and then in 1973 with Rudolf Kempe and the Staatskapelle Dresden.  Gramophone magazine said of the latter that despite the merits of rival recordings, \"for sheer charm and elegance\" this version won the palm. Tortelier made three studio recordings of the Elgar concerto - with Sir Malcolm Sargent and the BBC Symphony Orchestra in 1953, Sir Adrian Boult and the London Philharmonic Orchestra in 1972, and Groves and the RPO in 1988. The BBC issued a recording of a 1972 concert performance of the concerto with Boult and the BBC Symphony, on a CD that also includes a performance of the Brahms Double Concerto with the Torteliers pere et fils as soloists. His other recordings include concertos by Haydn, Saint-Saens, Dvorak and Walton, Tchaikovsky's Variations on a Rococo Theme, Beethoven's complete works for cello and piano with Eric Heidsieck and the cello sonatas of Debussy and Faure with Jean Hubeau. With Menuhin he recorded the double concertos of Brahms and Delius. Notes  ^ Other internationally famous soloists who played in Casals's orchestra included Isaac Stern and William Primrose ^ Tortelier said, \"Bach in German means brook - this brook runs to the river and that river runs to the sea.  It's a progression which begins delicately and poetically.  If you add too much expression with excessive Romanticism, the water stops flowing.  . . .  If you want to do an abstract Bach . . .  then the water turns cold.  That's no longer a Bach who glorifies God and nature, but one who glorifies the metronome.", "article_1": "PAUL TORTELIER by Marshall St.  John, 1999 Paul Tortelier, the famous French cellist, was born March 21, 1914 in Paris, where his father was a carpenter and cabinet-maker, who played the violin and the mandolin.  He was given a cello at the age of six by his mother, who loved the cello and wanted a cellist for a son.  She guided him every step of the way and followed every avenue for his advancement.  Beatrice Bluhm was his first teacher, and she emphasized the flexible wrist and free bow arm of the Franco-Belgian school of cello technique.  When Tortelier was ten he entered the Paris Conservatoire.  There he studied with Feuillard and then with Gerard Hekking, who taught him to love Bach and to make the suites \"dance. \" When Tortelier was sixteen years old, he won first prize at the Conservatoire, while in Gerard Hekking's cello class.  He had already gained much experience as a professional cellist, having performed in the cafes and cinemas of Paris.  His first orchestral job was as assistant principal of the Paris Radio Orchestra.  He played the Lalo Concerto, when he debuted in 1931 with the Concerts Lamoureux.  He also performed with the Calvet Quartet.  He studied harmony for three years with Jean Gallon in the Conservatoire (he received first prize in composition), and was a member of the Monte Carlo Symphony Orchestra from 1935 to 1937, where he played under the batons of Toscanini and Bruno Walter, as well as with Richard Strauss, who conducted his Don Quixote, with Tortelier playing the cello solo.  (He became internationally associated with Don Quixote, and played it with many orchestras around the world. ) In 1939 he became solo cellist with the Boston Symphony Orchestra under Serge Koussevitsky.  He eventually performed concerts with all the famous conductors and orchestras of the mid-twentieth century.  A French critic wrote, \"If Casals is Jupiter, then Tortelier is Apollo. \" Torterlier was a friend of Pablo Casals, and was invited to be principal cellist at the first Prades Festival, which commemorated the 200th anniversary of Bach's death.  He admired Casals very much and imitated some of his technique.  He said of Casals, \". . . he was probably the first cellist to use his left hand in the manner of a pianist--that is, by normally placing only one finger on the string at a time, rather than keeping all the fingers clamped down.  This allowed the fingers to vibrate freely. \" (From The Strad, April '84) Ginsberg wrote, \"Creative fantasy and a youthful abandon are inherent in his performing style. \" Tortelier was so moved by the Israeli effort to establish a homeland that he moved to Israel to assist in the effort.  He was forty years old then, at the height of his cellist powers.  He and his wive and their two children lived in Mabaroth, a Kibbutz, just a few hundred yards from the enemy border.  From 1956 to 1969 he was a professor at the Paris Conservatoire, and at the Folkwang Hochschule in Essen, from 1969 to 1975.  Shortly thereafter he became the first Westerner to be an honorary Professor of Music at the Central Conservatoire in Beijing, China.  He was a Frenchman, but advised his students to avoid French music.  Not that he disliked it, but he realized that the public wanted to hear Beethoven and Mozart.  He taught his students to be international in their musical tastes and performances.  As is the case with Rostropovich, Tortelier gradually began to do more conducting as he grew older.  He had an outgoing, lively personality, and taught master classes on British television.  The classes were quite popular, even with people who knew little about the cello or classical music.  Tortelier has a reputation for being a great story-teller, and a wide knowledge of art and literature, as well as music.  He not only is an excellent performer, but also a composer of many cello works.  His Sonata Breve (Bucephale), and Alla Maud are particularly well-known, as are his two cello concertos.  His edition of the Bach Suites came out in 1966.  He said, with regard to the Suites, \"To breathe life into music is more important than to prove respect for it. \" In 1971 he published his cello method, How I Play, How I Teach, which is particularly useful in training pupils to play modern music.  He was founder and president of the \"Mouvement Beethoven Association,\" begun on the 200th anniversary of Beethoven's birth, and designed to support progressively-minded composers.  Paul Tortelier died in December of 1990, at the age of 76.  His musical legacy is carried forward by his son, Yan-Pascal Tortelier, the internationally famous conductor of the BBC Philharmonic (recording on the Chandos label).  Amongst his better known cello students are Arto Noras, Raphael Sommer, and Jacqueline du Pre.  Yan-Pascal's sons are presently collating the writings and compositions of their grandfather.  For further information the reader is advised to read Ginsberg's History of the Violoncello, Campbell's The Great Cellists and Edward Seckerson's \"The French Connection. \" Return to Biographies", "article_2": "When Saint-Saens wanted to depict in music the stately progress of a swan, he called on the serene legato of the cello, the most dignified of all string instruments.

Think of Pablo Casals, the first truly modern cellist, who for almost a century fulminated against tyranny, the complacent and the routine.  Think, too, of Paul Tortelier, who had the lean, ascetic look of an El Greco saint, yet possessed the turbulent idealism of Don Quixote, whom he portrayed so memorably in Richard Strausss tone poem.  It was no surprise when, at the height of his career, Tortelier went off for a year to live and work on an Israeli kibbutz.  As a cellist he could be as 'swan-like as the rest of them, but he could also launch himself with great rhythmic energy to steer the frail craft of his cello through the rapids of one of the masterpieces of the cello repertoire.  Tortelier was born in Paris in 1914, months before the outbreak of the Great War.  Though the family knew poverty, it was his mothers dream that her son should be a cellist.  He started to learn the instrument at the age of six and three years later became a pupil of Louis Feuillard.  At 12 he entered Feuillards class at the Paris Conservatoire and when he graduated to Gerard Hekkings class he had already won a premier prix.  He won another (for a performance of Elgars Concerto) before leaving at 16 to play freelance in cafes and cinemas (in the days of silent movies, every picture house had its musicians).  A year later he made his professional debut playing Lalos Concerto at the Concerts Lamoureux.  At his mothers urging, Tortelier returned to the Conservatoire to study composition with Jean Gallon and to carry off yet another premier prix.  By this time the 'talkies had come, blocking one avenue of employment, but other opportunities - freelance work in the Parisian orchestras - were now open to him.  In 1935 he went to the Monte-Carlo Orchestra as principal cellist and two years later played Don Quixote under Strausss own direction.  That year he moved to America, where he was one of many French players in Serge Koussevitzkys Boston Symphony Orchestra.  Moving back to Paris in 1939, he suffered more lean times, refusing to compromise with the occupying Germans, but he emerged at the end of the war fully ready for the fine career that lay ahead.  Under Sir Thomas Beecham, he played the Concerto by his friend Jean Hubeau in Amsterdam and this led to an invitation to play Don Quixote in Beechams Richard Strauss festival in London in 1947.  The composer was present and praised the young cellists interpretation, which was recorded soon afterwards.  With his solo career established, Tortelier never looked back.  For most of his recording career, Tortelier was associated with EMI.  Paul Tortelier died suddenly in 1990, in his late 70s but still in possession of all his faculties.  Already he is part of history and most music-lovers under the age of 30 will never have heard him in the flesh.  It is all the more important, then, that his recordings should be available and that those of us who did experience the frisson he created in his prime should bear witness to his achievements.  Here was a musician who always gave freely of his vibrant, uniquely human tone and his limitless spirit. ", "article_3": "String playing is the greatest.

By Sasha Margolis Cellist Paul Tortelier was a magnetic performer, an innovative technician, a fascinating human being--and one of the string giants of his era.  Born in 1914, he was about a decade younger than fellow cellists Gregor Piatigorsky and Pierre Fournier, and about a decade older than Janos Starker and Mstislav Rostropovich.  He could hold his own with any of them.  Check out more from our Essential Historical Recordings series Tortelier was a product of the Paris Conservatoire, studying cello there with Louis Feuillard and Gerard Hekking, while also tying for a first prize in theory with fellow student and future composing great Henri Dutilleux.  A succession of principal cellist positions followed: Tortelier played with the Monte Carlo Philharmonic, the Boston Symphony under Koussevitsky, and in orchestras in Paris and London.  After World War II, he established an active solo career, especially in Europe.  In the 1950s, he enjoyed the signal honor of playing principal at Pablo Casals festival in the French village of Prades, also performing chamber music there with fellow artists including Szigeti, Stern, and Grumiaux.  Tortelier was an extraordinary musician.  Blessed with subtle and spontaneous rhythmic instincts, he was also committed to the idea that performance should be a theatrical endeavor.  His technical facility was remarkable, and his tone beautiful and deeply human.  Tone and facility alike were aided by the bent endpin he invented, which places the cello at a more horizontal angle than is traditional, and which was later adopted by Rostropovich and others.  Tortelier was also the rare cellist perfectly comfortable using his pinky in thumb position.  Advertisement A highly cultured man, Tortelier was a brilliant raconteur.  He was also an active composer, producing many works for cello, and several devoted to world peace.  His political passions were pronounced--and he didnt mind if they got in the way of his performing career.  Inspired by the foundation of the state of Israel, the non-Jewish Frenchman spent a year living and working on a kibbutz there--which took him away from Prades.  Troubled by the U. S.  involvement in Vietnam, he refused to tour America for the duration of the war, only returning, to great acclaim, in the 1980s.  He died in 1990, of a heart attack.  Tortelier spent a good deal of time in front of the microphone.  His recordings extend to most corners of the cello repertoire, though he never took up the major works of Prokofiev and Britten, and he recorded multiple versions of many pieces.  He is perhaps most closely identified with Don Quixote.  Even physically, Tortelier seemed to embody Cervantes title character: just like the Knight of the Mournful Countenance, he was tall and gaunt.  In the 1930s, he played the solos in Strauss Cervantes-inspired tone poem with the composer conducting.  He would go on to record the piece three times.  His second rendition, made in 1958 with Rudolf Kempe conducting the Berlin Philharmonic, may be the greatest.  Tortelier portrays Quixote with all the rhythmic imagination, dynamic variety, fantasy, drama, and pathos that the work demands.  Solo Bach suites (1982) Each day of his adulthood, Tortelier practiced solo Bach.  Over the course of a lifetime, he developed strong and idiosyncratic ideas on Bach interpretation, treating each suite as a cohesive whole, and attempting to steer clear of both excessive romanticism and excessive abstraction.  He recorded the complete Suites twice in the studio, and himself strongly preferred his later 1982 version, which features tempo extremes--slow slow movements and fast fast movements--and a flexible rhythmic attitude.  Among concertos, the Elgar was a Tortelier specialty.  He won first prize in cello at the Paris Conservatoire with it at age sixteen, when it was still a new piece.  He would go on to make three studio recordings, pairing most successfully with Sir Adrian Boult and the BBC Symphony in 1972.  His interpretation shares none of Jacqueline du Pres extroverted approach, although she spent time as his student.  Torteliers is a more stoic, quietly sorrowful Elgar.  Advertisement Elgar concerto with Sir Adrian Boult and the BBC Symphony A 1973 Paganini \"Moses\" Fantasy, with the English Chamber Orchestra conducted by Torteliers cellist wife Maud, displays the technical benefits of the bent endpin.  A 1955 Schubert Quintet recording with Casals, Stern, Sascha Schneider, and Milton Katims captures a great moment from Prades.  Finally, and unsurprisingly, Tortelier was known for his way with French repertoire.  A youthful recording of the Debussy Sonata with an impulsive Gerald Moore at the piano is riveting in its spontaneity and its kaleidoscopic array of subtly different moods.  His Ravel \"Piece en forme de Habanera\" is haunting, each phrase played with profound expression and total commitment.

Interested in many things outside music - he once harangued me for 45 minutes on the telephone about the need for world peace - he had a mind full of Gallic fantasy.  His interpretation of the Elgar Concerto was the perfect counterpoint to that of Jacqueline du Pre: contained, prayerful, held in an ideal Classical-Romantic poise.  PEDAGOGICAL BACKGROUND 'My fate was sealed long before my birth, Tortelier recalled.  'It was sealed on the day (in 1905) when my mother heard the cellist Francis Touche play in a cafe.  Determined to have a cellist in the family, his mother chose Beatrice Bluhm as Pauls teacher when he was six.  His other education was supplied privately, his mother taking in six boarders to pay for it.  She constantly reminded him to practise: 'Paul, ton violoncelle! Two of the lodgers were fine oboists who helped the lad develop musically, especially Jean Devergie.  When Paul was nine, Bluhm passed him on to Louis Feuillard, with whom he studied privately for three years.  'Feuillard had an extraordinary pedagogical sense, he recalled.  'He had the intuition and intelligence to know how to deal with young people.  He knew that they must not be presented with a thick book of etudes, that playing page after page of the same sort of exercise can become tedious.  They should be given just what is needed - no more, no less - and it has to be pleasant.  Paul had to play his teachers Daily Exercises every morning, thus developing dexterity in his left hand; and, although not yet ready for the Bach Suites, he was allowed to try them.  At 12 he entered Feuillards Paris Conservatoire class and at 14, having won a medal, transferred to Gerard Hekking, from whom he gained 'rhythmic elan and variety of colour.  At 16 he won a first prize and, after two years freelancing everywhere from cinemas to brasseries, returned to the Conservatoire to study harmony for three years with Jean Gallon, sharing the first prize with Henri Dutilleux.  TECHNIQUE & INTERPRETATIVE STYLE A remarkable feature of Torteliers mature technique was the long bent endpin which raised the cello up so that it was not far off horizontal.  Other cellists such as Rostropovich took it up.  It made playing in the first position difficult but assisted with the higher positions and enabled Tortelier to project the tone more easily He had an excellent left-hand technique and surpassed all his famed French rivals in subtlety and accuracy of bowing, for instance in the scherzo of the Elgar Concerto.  He was, above all, a Romantic player and his vivid imagination led him to construct a scenario for each piece, rather as Cortot did with the piano repertoire.  Torteliers warhorses were the Bach Suites, the Elgar Concerto and Strausss Don Quixote, which he had played both under Strausss baton in the 1930s and in his presence a decade later.  He would act out each episode in sound and action with remarkable vividness, even seeming to die when the Don died.  With his flying locks of hair and staring eyes, he looked exactly like most peoples image of Quixote.  SOUND Torteliers tone was all of a piece with his appearance - lean, sinewy, athletic and concentrated.  Yet he was capable of producing myriad colours, when the music called for them, and in Romantic music he could play with considerable warmth without ever crossing the boundaries of good taste.  He had a natural feeling for subtleties of vibrato, bow speed, rhythm and phrasing.  STRENGTHS At his best, Tortelier combined his Romantic leanings with a Classical sense of form and an ability to infuse his phrasing with a tingling intensity.  His living, breathing legato, his buoyant rhythm, his missionary zeal, his composers instincts - all made for memorable interpretations.  His solo Bach had a monkish devotional quality, his explorations of the French repertoire a Gallic gallantry.  He always seemed committed to what he was doing, whether he was playing one of the great concertos, collaborating with a favourite pianist - latterly his daughter Maria de la Pau - or giving one of his celebrated masterclasses.  WEAKNESSES It is difficult to think of weaknesses in Torteliers armoury as a cellist and a musician, except perhaps a slight conservatism as to repertoire.  He also remained loyal to some discredited editions, such as Grutzmachers disgraceful Boccherini and Fitzenhagens Tchaikovsky.  If he had a streak of vanity, it was more than offset by his genuine humility in the face of great music.  INSTRUMENTS & BOWS Torteliers first full-sized cello was a Lorenzo Ventapane selected by Feuillard, who also provided his second instrument, a Giovanni Francesco Pressenda.  He next had a 1706 Guarneri 'filius Andreae and then an 1850 Charles Adolphe Maucotel in addition.  He was the last of his generation to change from gut to metal strings.  He also designed a cello bridge.  He owned many good bows but lost a Vigneron and broke two of his three Peccattes.  Famed for his parsimony, he refused to pay for an airline seat for his cello: he travelled with his least good instrument, which would have to take its chance in the hold.  REPERTOIRE & RECORDINGS Tortelier ranged from Vivaldi and Bach to Hindemith and Shostakovich but avoided a good deal of 20th-century music, including Reger, Prokofiev and Britten.  A composer himself, he was not in sympathy with the Schoenbergian twelve-tone system.  Naturally he had a special fondness for French repertoire but he was a true internationalist.  For his main record company, HMV/EMI, he recorded a vast amount: the Elgar Concerto, the Saint-Saens A minor, Dvorak B minor and Brahms 'Double were all done twice, as were the Bach Suites; Don Quixote and Tchaikovskys Rococo Variations were recorded three times.  His versions of a clutch of Vivaldi concertos, the Haydn C major, Schumann, Lalo, Hindemith, Honegger and Walton concertos, Boellmanns Symphonic Variations and Bruchs Kol nidrei are first-rate.  He made famous recordings of the Beethoven, Brahms, Chopin, Faure, Debussy, Mendelssohn, Grieg, Rachmaninoff , Schubert Arpeggione and Saint-Saens C minor sonatas.  The Bach Gamba Sonatas and duplicates of the Debussy and Faure sonatas were done for Erato.  Tortelier never played in a quartet but recorded quite a lot of chamber music by Mozart, Schumann, Brahms, Ravel, Saint-Saens, Tcherepnin and so on.  Especially renowned is the Schubert C major Quintet from Prades, in which he plays second cello to his hero Casals, with Isaac Stern, Alexander Schneider and Milton Katims.  Notable among the live recordings is Mozarts E flat Divertimento with Joseph and Lillian Fuchs.  He liked to play pieces for two cellos with his wife, Maud Martin Tortelier, and some found their way on to record, including the Vivaldi Concerto.  A favourite disc of solo works coupled the Kodaly Sonata and Torteliers own delightful Suite, the most important of his own pieces to be documented.  Cello fanciers can find the great man playing a variety of encores - Saint-Saens and Faure were especially favoured, the formers 'Swan being recorded three times and the latters Elegie four times.  Among the DVDs, a live traversal of the Bach solo Suites from his last year is essential viewing. ", "article_5": "Paul Tortelier, a French cellist known for his elegant, passionate playing and for his political idealism, died of a heart attack on Tuesday at Villarceaux, France, near Paris, the news agency Reuters reported.  He was 76 years old and lived in Nice.  Mr.  Tortelier spent most of his long career in Europe, where he was a professor at the Paris Conservatory, a busy soloist and an author.  His master classes for the British Broadcasting Corporation attracted wide attention in 1964.  Among his more notable pupils was the cellist Jacqueline du Pre.  Mr.  Tortelier, on the other hand, was busy in the United States both at the beginning and at the end of his musical life.  In 1937, Serge Koussevitzky engaged him as a cellist for the Boston Symphony.  From Boston he began an American solo career, including a 1938 Town Hall recital with the pianist Leonard Shure.  A year later, Mr.  Tortelier returned to France and remained.  After a successful American tour in 1954, his career here dwindled, and by the time Lorin Maazel invited him again in the 1960's, the Vietnam War was in full swing.  Mr.  Tortelier, whose sensitivity to world politics was developed by his father in childhood, disagreed with America's stance on the war and refused the invitation.  Winning a Prize at 16 Early in the 1980's Mr.  Tortelier returned to concerts in the United States, and after a 35-year absence he played in New York again a year ago.  His last New York appearance was in February when he was a soloist with Bruno Weill and the New York Chamber Symphony.  Writing in The New York Times, James R.  Oestreich noted that Mr.  Tortelier \"showed no concern for fashionable notions of proper period practice\" but that \"his playing was on the whole so eloquent that it swept those considerations aside. \"", "article_6": "A consummate artist whose approach to the cello was directed toward breathing life into the music, Paul Tortelier earned the respect and affection of countless colleagues.  An enduring friendship with Pablo Casals found him playing, in the words of a French critic, Apollo to Casals ' Jupiter.  Like Casals , Tortelier emphasized using but one finger at a time on the string to allow free vibration.  Fantasy and emotional freedom marked his performances and attracted numerous young players.  Given a cello by his mother at age six, Tortelier was prompted toward a career from the beginning.  His first teacher, Beatrice Bluhm, exposed young Paul to the flexible wrist and free bowing arm favored by the Franco-Belgian School.  At ten, Tortelier entered the Paris Conservatoire, where his studied with Gerard Hekking, who encouraged a sense of rhythmic freedom and instilled in his pupil an abiding love for Bach .  While his lessons continued, he performed in Paris cafes and cinemas; at 16, he graduated from the Conservatoire with a first prize.  After joining the Paris Radio Orchestra as assistant principal, Tortelier made a debut with Lamoureux Concert Association , all the while studying harmony with Jean Gallon at the Conservatoire.  Completion of those courses brought another first prize, this time in composition.  As a member of the Monte Carlo Symphony Orchestra, Tortelier played under the direction of Toscanini and Walter and performed as soloist in Richard Strauss ' Don Quixote under the composer's direction.  Though his career advanced in the late 1930s, taking him to Asia and Africa, as well as North and South America, WWII curtailed his activities.  After the war, he resumed his concert appearances.  Impressed by efforts to establish Israeli statehood, Tortelier (a Catholic) moved his family to Mabaroth, a kibbutz only several hundred yards from the enemy border.  The first Prades Festival, celebrating the 200th anniversary of Bach 's death in 1950, drew an invitation from Casals to be principal cellist.  From 1956 to 1969, Tortelier was a professor at the Paris Conservatoire; from 1969 to 1975, he taught at the Folkwang Hochschule in Essen, Germany.  Conducting occupied more of his time in later years, as did composition (two concertos included).  His book, How I Play, How I Teach, has become a standard text for performance of modern cello works.

Along with Zeng Guofan, Li Hongzhang and Zuo Zongtang, Zhang Zhidong was one of the four most famous officials of the late Qing dynasty. [citation needed] Known for advocating controlled reform and modernization of Chinese troops, he served as the governor of Shanxi Province and viceroy of Huguang, Liangguang and Liangjiang, and also as a member of the Grand Council.  He took a leading role in the abolition of the Imperial examination system in 1905.  The Red Guards destroyed his tomb in 1966 during the Cultural Revolution.  His remains were rediscovered in 2007 and reburied with honors. Zhang Zhidong was also known by other names.  An older Wade-Giles form was Chang Chih-tung.  His courtesy name was Xiaoda (Xiao Da ; Xiao Da ; Xiaoda) or Xiangtao (Xiang Tao ; Xiang Tao ; Xiangtao).  His pseudonyms were Xiangyan (Xiang Yan ; Xiangyan), Hugong (Hu Gong ; Hu Gong ; Hugong), Wujing Jushi (Wu Jing Ju Shi ; Wu Jing Ju Shi ; Wujing Jushi) and Baobing (Bao Bing ; Baobing).  The posthumous name given to him by the Qing government was Wenxiang (Wen Xiang ; Wenxiang). Zhang was born in Xingyi Prefecture (Xing Yi Fu ), Guizhou Province, but his ancestral roots were in Nanpi, Tianjin, Zhili Province.  He was the cousin of Zhang Zhiwan.  In 1852, he sat for the provincial-level imperial examination in Shuntian Prefecture (present-day Beijing) and achieved the top position as jieyuan (Jie Yuan ) in the juren class.  In 1863, he sat for the palace-level examination and emerged as tanhua (Tan Hua ), the third highest-ranked candidate of the jinshi class.  He was then admitted to the Hanlin Academy as a bianxiu (Bian Xiu ; editor) before taking up other positions, including jiaoxi (Jiao Xi ), shidu (Shi Du ) and shijiang (Shi Jiang ).  In 1882, he was transferred as the xunfu (provincial governor) of Shanxi Province. Empress Dowager Cixi promoted him to Viceroy of Huguang in August 1889.  During the Dungan Revolt of 1862-1877, the Russian Empire occupied the Ili region in Xinjiang.  After Qing imperial forces successfully crushed the Dungan Revolt, they demanded that the Russians withdraw from Ili, which led to the Ili Crisis.  After the incompetent negotiator Chonghou, who was bribed by the Russians, without permission from the Qing government, signed a treaty granting Russia extraterritorial rights, consulates, control over trade, and an indemnity, a massive uproar by the Chinese literati ensued, some of them calling for Chonghou's death.  Zhang demanded for Chonghou's execution and urged the Qing government to stand up to Russia and declare the treaty invalid.  He said, \"The Russians must be considered extremely covetous and truculent in making the demands and Chonghou extremely stupid and absurd in accepting them. . .  If we insist on changing the treaty, there may not be trouble; if we do not, we are unworthy to be called a state. \" The Chinese literati demanded the Qing government mobilise their armed forces against the Russians.  The Qing government allocated important posts to officers from the Xiang Army, while British military officer Charles George Gordon advised the Chinese. Zhang became involved in the First Sino-Japanese War, although not on the frontline.  He initially advocated foreign aid from European forces near Tianjin in fighting the Japanese.  In October 1894, he telegraphed Li Hongzhang, the Viceroy of Zhili, proposing the purchase of naval equipment, and loans from foreign banks.  He further advocated this, and in addition the purchase of arms, alliance with European powers, and the \"clear division of rewards and punishments\" for troops, once the Japanese crossed the Yalu River into China in late October, threatening the northeastern provinces.  In early 1895, the Japanese had begun an assault on Shandong, and Zhang telegraphed the governor Li Bingheng in an emergency that suggested fast civil recruitments, the building of strong forts, and the use of landmines, to prevent further Japanese advance.  He had also sent arms and munitions to aid the campaign. Zhang held on a strong opinion on the issue of ceding Taiwan to the Japanese, per the 1895 Treaty of Shimonoseki that ended the First Sino-Japanese War.  In late February 1895, he made his stance clear to the Qing government, and even offered ideas on how to prevent the loss of Taiwan.  He suggested that they take huge loans from the British, who would in turn send their navy to defend Taiwan from the Japanese.  In addition, he proposed giving mining rights to the British on Taiwan for about 10 to 20 years.  In May 1895, the Qing government ordered all civil and military officials to evacuate Taiwan.  Zhang also refused to provide aid to the remaining Qing forces in Taiwan, especially after the fall of Keelung and with Taipei as the sole remaining Qing stronghold in Taiwan.  On 19 October 1895, the last of the Qing forces in Taiwan, led by Liu Yongfu, withdrew to Xiamen. After the defeat of Sino-French War in 1885, Zhang was said to reflect on the events of the war and expressed his desire to establish a modern military to match up to that of the Western forces in a memorial to the throne.  Upon Zhang's reflection, the weaknesses of traditional Chinese troops were identified in comparison with the Western troops, which had better firepower, mobility, and individual combat capability.  When Zhang created the Guangdong Military Academy, also known as Guangdong Naval and Military Officers Academy, and the Guangdong Victorious Army (Guang Sheng Jun ), he set physical admission standards high and hired German officers as instructors to address the weaknesses of the Chinese troops. Specifically, in modernizing the troops in Guangdong, Zhang made newly trained troops to be \"the nucleus\" of newer troops, passing the training unit to unit.  In addition, Zhang synthesized Chinese traditional learning and Western military learning in Guangdong Military Academy under his guiding principle of ti-yong(Ti Yong ), which stresses Chinese traditional values and deems Western imports to be for practical uses only. He also established the Hubei Military Academy (Hu Bei Xue Tang ) in 1896, where he employed instructors from the Guangdong Academy.  The majority of the staff were Chinese.  He also hired some German officers as instructors. While serving as the governor of Nanjing in 1894, Zhang invited a German training regiment of 12 officers and 24 warrant officers to train the local garrison into a modern military force.  In 1896, acting under an imperial decree, Zhang moved to Wuchang to serve as the Viceroy of Huguang, an area comprising Hubei and Hunan provinces.  Zhang drew on his experience in Nanjing to modernise the military forces under his command in Huguang. In Wuchang, Zhang effectively trained and equipped modern units of sappers, engineers, cavalry, police, artillery and infantry.  Of the 60,000 men under his command, 20,000 men were directly trained by foreign officers, and a military academy was established in Wuchang in order to train future generations of soldiers.  Zhang armed the troops with German Mauser rifles and other modern equipment.  Foreign observers reported that, when their training was complete, the troops stationed in the Wuchang garrison were the equal of contemporary European forces. During the Boxer Rebellion, Zhang, along with some other regional governors who commanded substantial modernised armies, refused to participate in the central government's declaration of war against the Eight-Nation Alliance.  Zhang assured the foreigners during negotiations that he would do nothing to help the central government. He told this to Everard Fraser. This clique was known as The Mutual Protection of Southeast China. Zhang's troops later became involved in politics.  In 1911, the Wuchang garrison led the Wuchang Uprising, a coup against the local government that catalysed the nationwide Xinhai Revolution.  The Xinhai Revolution led to the collapse of the Qing dynasty and its replacement by the Republic of China. Zhang Zhidong's clique in the late Qing court was extremely influential with a strong reform tendency.  Yang Rui, one of the Six Martyrs, was Zhang's political informant in Beijing who carried out Zhang's instructions during Hundred Days' Reform of 1898.  Chen Baozhen is another subordinate who shared Zhang's academic visions, and Chen coauthored a memorial to the court with Zhang to suggest the reform of Civil Service Exam.  Zhang had a strong grasp of the progress of reforms as he had more temporary confidants and informants from other regions. In the third month of 1898, Zhang published his work Exhortation to Study (Quan Xue Pian ), which addresses the questions of educational reform. He insisted on a method of relatively conservative reform, summarized in his phrase \"Chinese Learning as Substance, Western Learning for Application\" (Zhong Xue Wei Ti ,Xi Xue Wei Yong ).  In Exhortation to Study (Quan Xue Pian ), Zhang brought up reform methodology of implementing new schools at the expense of Buddhist and Taoist monasteries.  While doing so, reservation of 30 percent of the monasteries and introduction of Confucianization were also part of the methodology to help the two religions subsist.  Zhang Zhidong's reform on education is said not to eliminate religious institutions, but to better allocate resources. Kang Youwei, another late Qing reformist, later expressed similar mode of thinking - he also advocated aiding modern education at the cost of temples.  However, Kang Youwei is more radical as he envisions destruction of religions in comparison to Zhang's conservative approach.  Zhang was supportive of Kang's vision of scholarly learning, but rejects Kang's proposal of Confucian religion. Historians commonly regard Zhang Zhidong's reform as an attempt to reconcile modernity and China's existing social fabric. He succeeded Liu Kunyi as Viceroy of Liangjiang in 1901, and moved to Nanjing, where he laid the foundations for the modern University of Nanjing.  Zhang Zhidong, along with Liu Kunyi and Wei Guangtao, were the founders of Sanjiang Normal College.  Zhang espoused Japanese educational system and principles, and announced his plan to hire 12 Japanese teachers(Jiao Xi ) in a communication with Moriyoshi Nagaoka (Chang Gang Hu Mei ) before the establishment of the college. In 1900, he advocated the suppression of the Boxer Rebellion.  When the Eight-Nation Alliance entered Beijing, Zhang, along with Li Hongzhang and others, participated in The Mutual Protection of Southeast China.  He quelled local revolts and defeated the rebel army of Tang Caichang.  He was appointed the Minister of Military Affairs in 1906, and worked in Beijing for the central government.  He was aware that a change in Chinese affairs was necessary, and at the same time realized that the Chinese officials and people clung with unyielding tenacity to their ancient ideas and institutions and penned his ideas in a book: China's only hope: An Appeal. The book was distributed to the Grand Council of State, Viceroys, Governors and Literary Examiners of China.  Zhang Zhidong's sons were Zhang Yanqing and Zhang Renli.  Zhang died of illness in 1909 in Beijing.", "article_1": "Description Located at the site of Wuhans old steelworks, Studio Libeskinds design is a sweeping ark-like structure that is hoisted above the surrounding plaza by two steel and glass structures.  The gravity defying form is clad in geometric steel panels, reminiscent of the industries past.  Once inside, visitors climb the main staircase that connects to the exhibition spaces above where they are divided into four themes about the accomplishments and ideas surrounding the life of Zhang Zhidong.  The exhibition also includes various collaborations with local artists who explore aspects of the differing themes through installations and interactive works of art.  On the second floor of the museum is a semi-circular auditorium that features an oculus and opens to reveal a panoramic view of the old steelworks next door.  A central atrium connects the three levels of the building while ushering natural light into the galleries.  On the top gallery floor, the space is reserved for on-going temporary exhibitions.  At the apex of the building, a lattice opening in the structure allows for views out towards the city of Wuhan.  The landscaped areas surrounding the museum emphasize radiating lines and rings.  The plaza features a nautical dial pattern with Chinas major cities inscribed into the paving including Wuhan.  The hardscape uses local stone materials mixed with salvaged stone and brick works that were recovered during the site demolition.  The Museum of Zhang ZhiDong is dedicated to the life and contribution of the 19th century leader, who was a prominent and historical local figure who helped modernize Wuhan through the Industrial Revolution.  It was designed to recall the citys industrial past, while looking to the future.  The building was completed in May 2018.  \"The bold design of the building accurately reflects the force with which Wuhan was able to establish itself as a primary manufacturer of steel and iron in China while simultaneously accentuating the citys promising future. \" -Architects Newspaper, July 2013", "article_2": "Summary Zhang Zhidong, Wade-Giles romanization Chang Chih-tung, courtesy name (zi) Xiaoda, (born Sept.  2, 1837, Xingyi, Guizhou province, China--died Oct.  4, 1909), Chinese classicist and provincial official, one of the foremost reformers of his time.  Zhang was born to a family of scholar-officials in Xingyi, Guizhou province, but, in accordance with Chinese custom, he was considered native to Nanpi (in present-day Hebei) province, where his ancestors had settled in the 15th century.  He was unusually precocious as a student, passing his first-level civil service examinations at the age of 13 and all of the examinations by the time he was 26.  His literary talent and the fame he won from it were the foundations on which his career rested.  Zhangs experience as an official fell into two broad phases: from 1862 to 1882 he was a scholar and educational director, and from 1882 to 1907 he rose steadily from a provincial to a national leader.  Politically he was a supporter of the dowager empress, Cixi, who in turn favoured him with many promotions.  Appointed governor of Shanxi near the end of 1881, he became governor-general of Guangdong and Guangxi in 1884.  He was transferred to Hunan and Hubei in 1889 and remained in that post for 18 years, including three spent on missions to Nanjing and Beijing.  In 1907 he was summoned to the court to become a grand secretary and grand councillor.  Apart from being a capable and benevolent administrator, Zhang was deeply concerned with the rejuvenation of China.  His life nearly spanned the period from the Opium Wars to the Chinese Revolution of 1911-12, an era of unprecedented pressures on China from the West and from Japan.  The most pressing problem that Zhang and other officials faced was how China might survive and adapt itself to the modern world.  In the search for a solution, Zhang retained his faith in the traditional Chinese system but urged the acquisition of Western knowledge.  As his conception of the latter changed, so did the stress of his programs, but in his basic stand he never wavered.  It was for defense reasons that he launched the first iron-and-steel works in China.  In his total ignorance of metallurgical intricacies, Zhang ordered a complete smelting plant from England, without knowing what ore would be available.  He also failed to locate the plant near a coal-mining area.  Consequently, the works incurred severe losses after production began in 1894.  The debacle exposed Zhang to ridicule and placed him in political jeopardy.  Zhangs transfer to Hunan and Hubei was occasioned by his proposal to build a railway from Hankou to a point near Beijing.  Giving its assent, the court also appointed Zhang in charge of the construction.  After a long delay the line was completed in 1906.  Meanwhile, Zhang had set about industrializing the territory under his jurisdiction.  Among the industries he founded were a mint, tanneries, tile and silk factories, and paper, cotton, and woollen mills.  While on temporary duty in Nanjing, he trained a new army with the assistance of German instructors.  In 1895 China fought against Japan and lost, thus demonstrating the ineffectiveness of its previous reforms.  This setback turned Zhangs attention to education and Chinas need for better trained bureaucrats.  In 1898 he published his famous Quanxuepian (\"Exhortation to Learning\"), in which he reaffirmed his faith in Confucianism but detailed the measures needed for the acquisition of Western knowledge: study abroad by Chinese students, establishment of a school system, translation of Western and Japanese books, and acquisition of knowledge from foreign newspapers.  Accordingly, schools, newspapers, and translation bureaus were established in Hubei, and students were sent abroad to study; in 1908 the province supported 475 students in Japan and 103 in Western countries.  At the national level Zhang was charged, in 1904, with the task of drafting regulations for the entire school system.  As submitted and approved six months later, the regulations, eight volumes long, dealt with all aspects of education--including basic principles, administration, curricula, study abroad, vocational training, and structures of kindergartens and research academies.  Zhang repeatedly urged the abolition of the civil service examinations, and this was done in 1905.  Largely through Zhangs persistent efforts, the number of schools and students in China increased 73 and 225 times, respectively, between 1904 and 1909.  A striking feature of Zhangs career was his immunity to major political setbacks.  Perhaps the severest test of his political sagacity occurred during the Boxer Rebellion in 1900.  He was faced, as a loyal official, with the prospect of disobeying the imperial edict declaring war on foreign nations.  After consultation with other governors, Zhang decided that this decree should not be obeyed because it did not represent the true intention of the throne.  Accordingly, Zhang and other officials maintained peace in their territories by concluding an agreement with the foreign consuls.  As the Boxers collapsed, this action was endorsed and praised by the dowager empress.  Zhang was married three times, but all his wives died early.  He had six sons and four daughters.  In spite of his long tenure of office, he amassed no personal fortune and was not even well-to-do--he pawned his belongings once, when he was a governor-general.  He was canonized as Wenxiang (\"Learned and Accomplished\"), a coveted posthumous title. "}}

The constitution of meaning in human experience was his main interest and he wrote on perception, art, politics, religion, biology, psychology, psychoanalysis, language, nature, and history.  He was the lead editor of Les Temps modernes, the leftist magazine he established with Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir in 1945.  At the core of Merleau-Ponty's philosophy is a sustained argument for the foundational role that perception plays in the human experience of the world.  Merleau-Ponty understands perception to be an ongoing dialogue between one's lived body and the world which it perceives, in which perceivers passively and actively strive to express the perceived world in concert with others.  He was the only major phenomenologist of the first half of the twentieth century to engage extensively with the sciences.  It is through this engagement that his writings became influential in the project of naturalizing phenomenology, in which phenomenologists use the results of psychology and cognitive science.  Merleau-Ponty emphasized the body as the primary site of knowing the world, a corrective to the long philosophical tradition of placing consciousness as the source of knowledge, and maintained that the perceiving body and its perceived world could not be disentangled from each other.  The articulation of the primacy of embodiment (corporeite) led him away from phenomenology towards what he was to call \"indirect ontology\" or the ontology of \"the flesh of the world\" (la chair du monde), seen in his final and incomplete work, The Visible and Invisible, and his last published essay, \"Eye and Mind\".  Merleau-Ponty engaged with Marxism throughout his career.  His 1947 book, Humanism and Terror, has been widely misunderstood as a defence of the Soviet farce trials.  In fact, this text avoids the definitive endorsement of a view on the Soviet Union, but instead engages with the Marxist theory of history as a critique of liberalism, in order to reveal an unresolved antinomy in modern politics, between humanism and terror: if human values can only be achieved through violent force, and if liberal ideas hide illiberal realities, how is just political action to be decided? Merleau-Ponty maintained an engaged though critical relationship to the Marxist left until the end of his life, particularly during his time as the political editor of the journal Les Temps modernes. Merleau-Ponty's grave at Pere Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, where he is buried with his mother Louise, his wife Suzanne, and his daughter Marianne.  Maurice Merleau-Ponty was born in 1908 in Rochefort-sur-Mer, Charente-Inferieure (now Charente-Maritime), France.  His father died in 1913 when Merleau-Ponty was five years old. After secondary schooling at the Lycee Louis-le-Grand in Paris, Merleau-Ponty became a student at the Ecole Normale Superieure, where he studied alongside Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, Simone Weil, Jean Hyppolite, and Jean Wahl.  As Beauvoir recounts in her autobiography, she developed a close friendship with Merleau-Ponty and became smitten with him, but ultimately found him too well-adjusted to bourgeois life and values for her taste.  He attended Edmund Husserl's \"Paris Lectures\" in February 1929. In 1929, Merleau-Ponty received his DES degree (diplome d'etudes superieures , roughly equivalent to a M. A.  thesis) from the University of Paris, on the basis of the (now-lost) thesis La Notion de multiple intelligible chez Plotin (\"Plotinus's Notion of the Intelligible Many\"), directed by Emile Brehier. He passed the agregation in philosophy in 1930.  Merleau-Ponty was raised as a Roman Catholic.  He was friends with the Christian existentialist author and philosopher Gabriel Marcel and wrote articles for the Christian leftist journal Esprit, but he left the Catholic Church in 1937 because he felt his socialist politics were not compatible with the social and political doctrine of the Catholic Church. An article published in the French newspaper Le Monde in October 2014 makes the case of recent discoveries about Merleau-Ponty's likely authorship of the novel Nord.  Recit de l'arctique (Grasset, 1928).  Convergent sources from close friends (Beauvoir, Elisabeth \"Zaza\" Lacoin) seem to leave little doubt that Jacques Heller was a pseudonym of the 20-year-old Merleau-Ponty. Merleau-Ponty taught first at the Lycee de Beauvais (1931-33) and then got a fellowship to do research from the Caisse nationale de la recherche scientifique .  From 1934 to 1935 he taught at the Lycee de Chartres.  He then in 1935 became a tutor at the Ecole Normale Superieure, where he tutored a young Michel Foucault and Tran Duc Thao and was awarded his doctorate on the basis of two important books: La structure du comportement (1942) and Phenomenologie de la Perception (1945).  During this time, he attended Alexandre Kojeve's influential seminars on Hegel and Aron Gurwitsch's lectures on Gestalt psychology.  In the spring of 1939, he was the first foreign visitor to the newly established Husserl Archives, where he consulted Husserl's unpublished manuscripts and met Eugen Fink and Father Hermann Van Breda.  In the summer of 1939, as France declared war on Nazi Germany, he served on the frontlines in the French Army, where he was wounded in battle in June 1940.  Upon returning to Paris in the fall of 1940, he married Suzanne Jolibois, a Lacanian psychoanalyst, and founded an underground resistance group with Jean-Paul Sartre called \"Under the Boot\".  He participated in an armed demonstration against the Nazi forces during the liberation of Paris. After teaching at the University of Lyon from 1945 to 1948, Merleau-Ponty lectured on child psychology and education at the Sorbonne from 1949 to 1952. He was awarded the Chair of Philosophy at the College de France from 1952 until his death in 1961, making him the youngest person to have been elected to a chair.  Besides his teaching, Merleau-Ponty was also political editor for the leftist journal Les Temps modernes from its founding in October 1945 until December 1952.  In his youth, he had read Karl Marx's writings and Sartre even claimed that Merleau-Ponty converted him to Marxism. While he was not a member of the French Communist Party and did not identify as a Communist, he laid out an argument justifying the Soviet farce trials and political violence for progressive ends in general in the work Humanism and Terror in 1947.  However, about three years later, he renounced his earlier support for political violence, rejected Marxism, and advocated a liberal left position in Adventures of the Dialectic (1955). His friendship with Sartre and work with Les Temps modernes ended because of that, since Sartre still had a more favourable attitude towards Soviet communism.  Merleau-Ponty was subsequently active in the French non-communist left and in particular in the Union of the Democratic Forces.  Merleau-Ponty died suddenly of a stroke in 1961 at age 53, apparently while preparing for a class on Rene Descartes, leaving an unfinished manuscript which was posthumously published in 1964, along with a selection of Merleau-Ponty's working notes, by Claude Lefort as The Visible and the Invisible.  He is buried in Pere Lachaise Cemetery in Paris with his mother Louise, his wife Suzanne and their daughter Marianne. In his Phenomenology of Perception (first published in French in 1945), Merleau-Ponty develops the concept of the body-subject (le corps propre) as an alternative to the Cartesian \"cogito\". [citation needed] This distinction is especially important in that Merleau-Ponty perceives the essences of the world existentially.  Consciousness, the world, and the human body as a perceiving thing are intricately intertwined and mutually \"engaged\".  The phenomenal thing is not the unchanging object of the natural sciences, but a correlate of our body and its sensory-motor functions.  Taking up and \"communing with\" (Merleau-Ponty's phrase) the sensible qualities it encounters, the body as incarnated subjectivity intentionally elaborates things within an ever-present world frame, through use of its pre-conscious, pre-predicative understanding of the world's makeup.  The elaboration, however, is \"inexhaustible\" (the hallmark of any perception according to Merleau-Ponty).  Things are that upon which our body has a \"grip\" (prise), while the grip itself is a function of our connaturality with the world's things.  The world and the sense of self are emergent phenomena in an ongoing \"becoming\".  The essential partiality of our view of things, their being given only in a certain perspective and at a certain moment in time does not diminish their reality, but on the contrary establishes it, as there is no other way for things to be copresent with us and with other things than through such \"Abschattungen\" (sketches, faint outlines, adumbrations).  The thing transcends our view, but is manifest precisely by presenting itself to a range of possible views.  The object of perception is immanently tied to its background--to the nexus of meaningful relations among objects within the world.  Because the object is inextricably within the world of meaningful relations, each object reflects the other (much in the style of Leibniz's monads).  Through involvement in the world - being-in-the-world - the perceiver tacitly experiences all the perspectives upon that object coming from all the surrounding things of its environment, as well as the potential perspectives that that object has upon the beings around it.  Each object is a \"mirror of all others\".  Our perception of the object through all perspectives is not that of a propositional, or clearly delineated, perception; rather, it is an ambiguous perception founded upon the body's primordial involvement and understanding of the world and of the meanings that constitute the landscape's perceptual Gestalt.  Only after we have been integrated within the environment so as to perceive objects as such can we turn our attention toward particular objects within the landscape so as to define them more clearly.  This attention, however, does not operate by clarifying what is already seen, but by constructing a new Gestalt oriented toward a particular object.  Because our bodily involvement with things is always provisional and indeterminate, we encounter meaningful things in a unified though ever open-ended world. From the time of writing Structure of Behavior and Phenomenology of Perception, Merleau-Ponty wanted to show, in opposition to the idea that drove the tradition beginning with John Locke, that perception was not the causal product of atomic sensations.  This atomist-causal conception was being perpetuated in certain psychological currents of the time, particularly in behaviourism.  According to Merleau-Ponty, perception has an active dimension, in that it is a primordial openness to the lifeworld (the \"Lebenswelt\").  This primordial openness is at the heart of his thesis of the primacy of perception.  The slogan of Husserl's phenomenology is \"all consciousness is consciousness of something\", which implies a distinction between \"acts of thought\" (the noesis) and \"intentional objects of thought\" (the noema).  Thus, the correlation between noesis and noema becomes the first step in the constitution of analyses of consciousness.  However, in studying the posthumous manuscripts of Husserl, who remained one of his major influences, Merleau-Ponty remarked that, in their evolution, Husserl's work brings to light phenomena which are not assimilable to noesis-noema correlation.  This is particularly the case when one attends to the phenomena of the body (which is at once body-subject and body-object), subjective time (the consciousness of time is neither an act of consciousness nor an object of thought) and the other (the first considerations of the other in Husserl led to solipsism).  The distinction between \"acts of thought\" (noesis) and \"intentional objects of thought\" (noema) does not seem, therefore, to constitute an irreducible ground.  It appears rather at a higher level of analysis.  Thus, Merleau-Ponty does not postulate that \"all consciousness is consciousness of something\", which supposes at the outset a noetic-noematic ground.  Instead, he develops the thesis according to which \"all consciousness is perceptual consciousness\".  In doing so, he establishes a significant turn in the development of phenomenology, indicating that its conceptualisations should be re-examined in the light of the primacy of perception, in weighing up the philosophical consequences of this thesis. Taking the study of perception as his point of departure, Merleau-Ponty was led to recognize that one's own body (le corps propre) is not only a thing, a potential object of study for science, but is also a permanent condition of experience, a constituent of the perceptual openness to the world.  He therefore underlines the fact that there is an inherence of consciousness and of the body of which the analysis of perception should take account.  The primacy of perception signifies a primacy of experience, so to speak, insofar as perception becomes an active and constitutive dimension.  Merleau-Ponty demonstrates a corporeity of consciousness as much as an intentionality of the body, and so stands in contrast with the dualist ontology of mind and body in Descartes, a philosopher to whom Merleau-Ponty continually returned, despite the important differences that separate them.  In the Phenomenology of Perception Merleau-Ponty wrote: \"Insofar as I have hands, feet, a body, I sustain around me intentions which are not dependent on my decisions and which affect my surroundings in a way that I do not choose\" (1962, p. The question concerning corporeity connects also with Merleau-Ponty's reflections on space (l'espace) and the primacy of the dimension of depth (la profondeur) as implied in the notion of being in the world (etre au monde; to echo Heidegger's In-der-Welt-sein) and of one's own body (le corps propre). Reflections on spatiality in phenomenology are also central to the advanced philosophical deliberations in architectural theory. The highlighting of the fact that corporeity intrinsically has a dimension of expressivity which proves to be fundamental to the constitution of the ego is one of the conclusions of The Structure of Behavior that is constantly reiterated in Merleau-Ponty's later works.  Following this theme of expressivity, he goes on to examine how an incarnate subject is in a position to undertake actions that transcend the organic level of the body, such as in intellectual operations and the products of one's cultural life.  He carefully considers language, then, as the core of culture, by examining in particular the connections between the unfolding of thought and sense--enriching his perspective not only by an analysis of the acquisition of language and the expressivity of the body, but also by taking into account pathologies of language, painting, cinema, literature, poetry, and music.  This work deals mainly with language, beginning with the reflection on artistic expression in The Structure of Behavior--which contains a passage on El Greco (p.  203ff) that prefigures the remarks that he develops in \"Cezanne's Doubt\" (1945) and follows the discussion in Phenomenology of Perception.  The work, undertaken while serving as the Chair of Child Psychology and Pedagogy at the University of the Sorbonne, is not a departure from his philosophical and phenomenological works, but rather an important continuation in the development of his thought.  As the course outlines of his Sorbonne lectures indicate, during this period he continues a dialogue between phenomenology and the diverse work carried out in psychology, all in order to return to the study of the acquisition of language in children, as well as to broadly take advantage of the contribution of Ferdinand de Saussure to linguistics, and to work on the notion of structure through a discussion of work in psychology, linguistics and social anthropology. Merleau-Ponty distinguishes between primary and secondary modes of expression.  This distinction appears in Phenomenology of Perception (p.  207, 2nd note [Fr.  ed. ]) and is sometimes repeated in terms of spoken and speaking language (le langage parle et le langage parlant) (The Prose of the World, p.  10).  Spoken language (le langage parle), or secondary expression, returns to our linguistic baggage, to the cultural heritage that we have acquired, as well as the brute mass of relationships between signs and significations.  Speaking language (le langage parlant), or primary expression, such as it is, is language in the production of a sense, language at the advent of a thought, at the moment where it makes itself an advent of sense.  It is speaking language, that is to say, primary expression, that interests Merleau-Ponty and which keeps his attention through his treatment of the nature of production and the reception of expressions, a subject which also overlaps with an analysis of action, of intentionality, of perception, as well as the links between freedom and external conditions.  The notion of style occupies an important place in \"Indirect Language and the Voices of Silence\".  In spite of certain similarities with Andre Malraux, Merleau-Ponty distinguishes himself from Malraux in respect to three conceptions of style, the last of which is employed in Malraux's The Voices of Silence.  Merleau-Ponty remarks that in this work \"style\" is sometimes used by Malraux in a highly subjective sense, understood as a projection of the artist's individuality.  Sometimes it is used, on the contrary, in a very metaphysical sense (in Merleau-Ponty's opinion, a mystical sense), in which style is connected with a conception of an \"uber-artist\" expressing \"the Spirit of Painting\".  Finally, it sometimes is reduced to simply designating a categorization of an artistic school or movement.  (However, this account of Malraux's notion of style--a key element in his thinking--is open to serious question.) For Merleau-Ponty, it is these uses of the notion of style that lead Malraux to postulate a cleavage between the objectivity of Italian Renaissance painting and the subjectivity of painting in his own time, a conclusion that Merleau-Ponty disputes.  According to Merleau-Ponty, it is important to consider the heart of this problematic, by recognizing that style is first of all a demand owed to the primacy of perception, which also implies taking into consideration the dimensions of historicity and intersubjectivity.  (However, Merleau-Ponty's reading of Malraux has been questioned in a recent major study of Malraux's theory of art which argues that Merleau-Ponty seriously misunderstood Malraux. ) For Merleau-Ponty, style is born of the interaction between two or more fields of being.  Rather than being exclusive to individual human consciousness, consciousness is born of the pre-conscious style of the world, of Nature. In his essay Cezanne's Doubt, in which he identifies Paul Cezanne's impressionistic theory of painting as analogous to his own concept of radical reflection, the attempt to return to, and reflect on, prereflective consciousness, Merleau-Ponty identifies science as the opposite of art.  In Merleau-Ponty's account, whereas art is an attempt to capture an individual's perception, science is anti-individualistic.  In the preface to his Phenomenology of Perception, Merleau-Ponty presents a phenomenological objection to positivism: that it can tell us nothing about human subjectivity.  All that a scientific text can explain is the particular individual experience of that scientist, which cannot be transcended.  For Merleau-Ponty, science neglects the depth and profundity of the phenomena that it endeavors to explain.  Merleau-Ponty understood science to be an ex post facto abstraction.  Causal and physiological accounts of perception, for example, explain perception in terms that are arrived at only after abstracting from the phenomenon itself.  Merleau-Ponty chastised science for taking itself to be the area in which a complete account of nature may be given.  The subjective depth of phenomena cannot be given in science as it is.  This characterizes Merleau-Ponty's attempt to ground science in phenomenological objectivity and, in essence, to institute a \"return to the phenomena\". Anticognitivist cognitive science  Merleau-Ponty's critical position with respect to science was stated in his Preface to the Phenomenology: he described scientific points of view as \"always both naive and at the same time dishonest\".  Despite, or perhaps because of, this view, his work influenced and anticipated the strands of modern psychology known as post-cognitivism.  Hubert Dreyfus has been instrumental in emphasising the relevance of Merleau-Ponty's work to current post-cognitive research, and its criticism of the traditional view of cognitive science.  Dreyfus's seminal critique of cognitivism (or the computational account of the mind), What Computers Can't Do, consciously replays Merleau-Ponty's critique of intellectualist psychology to argue for the irreducibility of corporeal know-how to discrete, syntactic processes.  Through the influence of Dreyfus's critique and neurophysiological alternative, Merleau-Ponty became associated with neurophysiological, connectionist accounts of cognition.  With the publication in 1991 of The Embodied Mind by Francisco Varela, Evan Thompson, and Eleanor Rosch, this association was extended, if only partially, to another strand of \"anti-cognitivist\" or post-representationalist cognitive science: embodied or enactive cognitive science, and later in the decade, to neurophenomenology.  In addition, Merleau-Ponty's work has also influenced researchers trying to integrate neuroscience with the principles of chaos theory. It was through this relationship with Merleau-Ponty's work that cognitive science's affair with phenomenology was born, which is represented by a growing number of works, including Feminist philosophy  Merleau-Ponty has also been picked up by Australian and Nordic philosophers inspired by the French feminist tradition, including Rosalyn Diprose and Sara Heinamaa .  Heinamaa has argued for a rereading of Merleau-Ponty's influence on Simone de Beauvoir.  (She has also challenged Dreyfus's reading of Merleau-Ponty as behaviorist[citation needed], and as neglecting the importance of the phenomenological reduction to Merleau-Ponty's thought. ) Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology of the body has also been taken up by Iris Young in her essay \"Throwing Like a Girl,\" and its follow-up, \"'Throwing Like a Girl': Twenty Years Later\".  Young analyzes the particular modalities of feminine bodily comportment as they differ from that of men.  Young observes that while a man who throws a ball puts his whole body into the motion, a woman throwing a ball generally restricts her own movements as she makes them, and that, generally, in sports, women move in a more tentative, reactive way.  Merleau-Ponty argues that we experience the world in terms of the \"I can\" - that is, oriented towards certain projects based on our capacity and habituality.  Young's thesis is that in women, this intentionality is inhibited and ambivalent, rather than confident, experienced as an \"I cannot\". Ecophenomenology can be described as the pursuit of the relationalities of worldly engagement, both human and those of other creatures (Brown & Toadvine 2003).  This engagement is situated in a kind of middle ground of relationality, a space that is neither purely objective, because it is reciprocally constituted by a diversity of lived experiences motivating the movements of countless organisms, nor purely subjective, because it is nonetheless a field of material relationships between bodies.  It is governed exclusively neither by causality, nor by intentionality.  In this space of in-betweenness, phenomenology can overcome its inaugural opposition to naturalism. David Abram explains Merleau-Ponty's concept of \"flesh\" (chair) as \"the mysterious tissue or matrix that underlies and gives rise to both the perceiver and the perceived as interdependent aspects of its spontaneous activity\", and he identifies this elemental matrix with the interdependent web of earthly life. This concept unites subject and object dialectically as determinations within a more primordial reality, which Merleau-Ponty calls \"the flesh\" and which Abram refers to variously as \"the animate earth\", \"the breathing biosphere\" or \"the more-than-human natural world\".  Yet this is not nature or the biosphere conceived as a complex set of objects and objective processes, but rather \"the biosphere as it is experienced and lived from within by the intelligent body -- by the attentive human animal who is entirely a part of the world that he or she experiences.  Merleau-Ponty's ecophenemonology with its emphasis on holistic dialog within the larger-than-human world also has implications for the ontogenesis and phylogenesis of language; indeed he states that \"language is the very voice of the trees, the waves and the forest\". Merleau-Ponty himself refers to \"that primordial being which is not yet the subject-being nor the object-being and which in every respect baffles reflection.  From this primordial being to us, there is no derivation, nor any break. . . \" Among the many working notes found on his desk at the time of his death, and published with the half-complete manuscript of The Visible and the Invisible, several make it evident that Merleau-Ponty himself recognized a deep affinity between his notion of a primordial \"flesh\" and a radically transformed understanding of \"nature\".  Hence, in November 1960 he writes: \"Do a psychoanalysis of Nature: it is the flesh, the mother. \" And in the last published working note, written in March 1961, he writes: \"Nature as the other side of humanity (as flesh, nowise as 'matter'). \" This resonates with the conception of space, place, dwelling, and embodiment (in the flesh and physical, vs.  virtual and cybernetic), especially as they are addressed against the background of the unfolding of the essence of modern technology.  Such analytics figure in a Heideggerian take on \"econtology\" as an extension of Heidegger's consideration of the question of being (Seinsfrage) by way of the fourfold (Das Geviert) of earth-sky-mortals-divinities (Erde und Himmel, Sterblichen und Gottlichen).  In this strand of \"ecophenomenology\", ecology is co-entangled with ontology, whereby the worldly existential analytics are grounded in earthiness, and environmentalism is orientated by ontological thinking.

The perceived world is the always presupposed foundation of all rationality, all value and all existence. \" \"[the phenomenologist returns] to the world which precedes [scientific description], [the world] of which science always speaks, and in relation to which every scientific characterization is an abstract and derivative sign language, as is geography to the countryside. \" ON MAURICE MERLEAU-PONTY (1906-1961) Paul Ricoeur has called Merleau-Ponty \"the greatest of the French phenomenologists. \" Along with Sartre, Merleau-Ponty introduced phenomenological thought to France.  Drawing upon the phenomenology of Edmund Husserl and the existentialist orientation of Heidegger and Marcel, Merleau-Ponty can be credited with introducing the conception of the \"lived body\" to existential-phenomenological thought (already latently present, for example, in Heidegger's distinction between the \"ready-to-hand\" and the \"present-to-hand\" in Being & Time).  Merleau-Ponty held the chair of child psychology and pedagogy at the Sorbonne, which was later held by Jean Piaget.  He then became professor of philosophy at the College de France.  He died young and suddenly in 1961 while working on his uncompleted manuscript, The Visible and the Invisible.  Merleau-Ponty's masterpiece, Phenomenology of Perception, was a bold, internally coherent attempt to overcome the problems of empiricism and rationalism in the Cartesian tradition of modern philosophy.  As Dillon has shown in his Merleau-Ponty's Ontology, it is pedagogically instructive to introduce Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology as an attempt to resolve Meno's paradox.  Meno's paradox, of course, is from the dialogue between Meno and Plato in Plato's Meno.  Meno poses a dilemma to Plato: \"But how will you look for something when you don't in the least know what it is? How on earth are you going to set up something you don't know as the object of your search? To put it another way, even if you come right up against it, how will you know that what you found is the thing you didn't know?\" Merleau-Ponty's existential-phenomenological epistemology and ontology can be seen as resolving the problem of Meno's paradox, and it does so by relentlessly demonstrating how both empiricism and rationalism fail to do so.  Merleau-Ponty writes: \"Empiricism cannot see that we need to know what we are looking for, otherwise we would not be looking for it, and intellectualism (rationalism) fails to see that we need to be ignorant of what we are looking for, or equally again we should not be searching. \" (Phenomenology of Perception) All of philosophy is at stake with Meno's paradox, and, with it, the individual sciences, too, are at stake.  To see how Merleau-Ponty resolves the problems of empiricism and rationalism, it is necessary to understand how each are problematic on their own terms.  Empiricism claims that consciousness is shaped by the transcedent world.  By the transcendent world, we mean the world outside of human experience.  But this is a problem.  If all we can know is the transcendent world, which is outside of experience, how will we know that we've found what we're looking for once we find it? By thinking out of Descartes' philosophy, empiricism begins with a split between subject (consciousness) and objects (things ouside of consciousness).  The question becomes: How does the subject come to know objects? For empiricism, the subject comes to know objects through experience.  On this point, phenomenology agrees.  But empiricism has several assumptions which cause it problems.  With Descartes, empiricism argues that truth is certainty.  Because empiricism begins with this idea of truth, it has to argue that what is true in perception must be absolutely determined and unambiguous.  Thus, the empiricists begin with the atomistic sense-impression.  But as Gestalt psychology has demonstrated, we never experience atomistic sense impressions; rather, we experience Gestalts.  We discover things in a context, as a foreground against a background.  Merleau-Ponty argues that the assumption of empiricism is due to the \"experience error. \" The \"experience error\" is the error of attributing to a phenomenon what prior concepts dictate should be found in it.  In psychology, this became a major problem with E. B.  Titchener's introspectionism.  Titchener began with the assumption of atomism, and this lead to problems with his method, ultimately leading to a rejection of his method by psychological science.  Empiricism, due to the experience error, views the phenomenon as always hard-edged and determinate.  This is how the empiricist arrives at the abstract idea of the \"atomistic\" sense impressions which, in truth, we never experience.  The empiricist invents the idea of the \"atom\" by borrowing this metaphor from Newton's physics rather than from reflection on pre-objective experience.  Instead, Merleau-Ponty begins with the everyday, lived engagement with the world (what Heidegger would call the \"ready-to-hand\") and what he finds is that we originally experience things as rich and multi-determinate, always within a context.  As such, this \"pre-objective\" experience is ambiguous, like the Necker Cube made famous by Gestalt psychology: Note that you can view the front of the cube as either facing down and to the right or up and to the left.  The cube is an ambiguous figure.  This idea of the \"experience error\" leads to a second mistake for empiricism, which Merleau-Ponty refers to as \"the constancy hypothesis. \" The constancy hypothesis maintains that there is a point-to-point correspondence and constant connection between the stimulus and any basic perception.  For each point on the surface of a stimulus (what is seen), there is a point of stimulation on the retina.  This leads to the reduction of the thing and percept to atomistic elements.  Problems arise for the constancy hypothesis when determinate stimuli produce ambiguously determinable perceptions, such as the Necker cube above.  Because the empiricists begin with the assumption of atomism, they then have to create a way to put all these atomist sense impressions back together again in order to form the whole percept.  Thus, the empiricsts resort to \"association\" as the glue which holds the atoms together.  This, of course, leads to a new problem.  If association happens in the mind, how do we know that the way the atoms are put together in the mind (the immanent) are the same as the way they appear outside of our experience (the transcedent)? This leads to a kind of skepticism, of which Berkeley is a case in point.  The world becomes unknowable outside of human existence.  In the end, what we are left with is an inability to solve Meno's paradox.  If the world is unknowable, how will we know we've discovered something true? Rationalism, like empiricism, is also rooted in the tradition of Descartes.  It also understands truth as certainty.  And it too begins with a split between subject and object, immanence and transcendence.  Within these same assumptions, however, it takes an opposite stance from empiricism.  While empiricism claims that all knowledge of the world comes from experinece, the rationalist holds that all knowledge is a priori, already known by the subject prior to experience.  The mind organizes or constitutes the things in experinece, and we can never know the thing in itself outside of experience (Kant is a good example of this perspective).  Rationalism cannot solve Meno's paradox, either.  If I already know what I am seeking to discover, why bother searching? If rationalism is correct, philosophy and psychology, as well as the sciences, are a pointless endeavor.  Yet, we do search, and we search because the transcendent world is a mystery to us; yet we believe that, with a search for truth, we can discover and understand the world.  Merleau-Ponty begins his phenomenology by giving primacy to perception.  The phenomenologist, says Merleau-Ponty, returns \"to the world which precedes (scientific description), (the world) of which science always speaks, and in relation to which every scientific characterization is an abstract and derivative sign language as is geography in relation to the countryside. \" Beginning with things as they show themselves in perception, Merleau-Ponty discovers that things do not simply impose themselves on consciousness as atomistic sense impressions, nor do we construct things in our minds.  Rather, things as we experience them are discovered through a subject-object dialogue.  In order to understand how Merleau-Ponty understands this subject-object dialogue, we first need to understand a new idea, something which Merleau-Ponty brought to phenomenology: the idea of the lived body.  For Merleau-Ponty, consciousness is not just something that goes on in our heads.  Rather, our intentional consciousness is experienced in and through our bodies.  With his concept of the lived body, Merleau-Ponty overcomes Descartes' mind-body dualism without resorting to physiological reductionism.  Recall that for Descartes the body is a machine and the mind is what runs the machine.  For Merleau-Ponty the body is not a machine, but a living organism by which we body-forth our possibilities in the world.  The current of a person's intentional existence is lived through the body.  We are our bodies, and consciousness is not just locked up inside the head.  In his later thought, Merleau-Ponty talked of the body as \"flesh,\" made of the same flesh of the world, and it is because the flesh of the body is of the flesh of the world that we can know and understand the world (see The Visible and the Invisible ).  To demonstrate this concept of the lived body, Merleau-Ponty uses the example of the phantom limb.  A phantom limb would not be possible if our bodies were just machines.  If a part of the machine was severed from the rest of the machine, it would simply go without using the limb.  Yet, people who have a limb amputated still feel the limb, and they are still called to use the limb in situations that call for its use, even though it is no longer there.  In this same sense, the whole lived body is an intentional body, which is lived through in relation to possibilities in the world.  Even when the limb is gone, the possibilities for its use remain, but are unable to be taken up as a project in the world.  This is why the phantom limb phenomenon is so awe-ful; the arm is gone, and yet the person still feels the call to use it.  It is important to understand that Merleau-Ponty is not resorting here to physiological reductionism.  The physiologist, at least traditionally, sees the body as separate parts that work together like a machine.  For Merleau-Ponty, however, the body cannot be understood as separate parts but must be understand as a whole, as it is lived.  The body as it is lived is an experiential body, a body that opens onto a world and allows the world to be for us.  Physiology is not pointless; it has value, no doubt.  But it does not get at the lived body.  If we want to understand the body as it is lived in our experience, we have to use a phenomenological method.  Merleau-Ponty would go so far as to argue that physiology is a second-order, intellectual abstraction from the primordial, lived body.  In this sense, phenomenology can understand and incorporate physiological insights, but physiology is unable to incorporate phenomenological insights when it begins with a reductive approach.  The idea of the lived body allows Merleau-Ponty to resolve Meno's paradox.  The body is both transcendent and immanent.  It is the \"third term\" between subject and object.  I know that transcendent things exist because I can touch them, see them, hear them.  But most importantly, I never know things in their totality, but always from an embodied perspective.  Because I am a body, I can only see things from a certain perspective, and yet, because I am a body, I can also experience the thing as being more than that partial perspective.  The thing exists \"in itself\" because it resists my knowing it with total certainty.  However, the thing exists \"for me\" because I always experience it in relation to my own body.  A chair, for example, is something to sit on.  A desk is something to sit at and write on.  Things allow for certain bodily engagements while closing off others.  In this sense, things are both transcedent and immanent; things as given to experience are each an \"in-itself-for-me. \" If we can understand this idea of the \"in-itself-for-me,\" we can see how experience as it is given to us is always a subject-object dialogue.  I can never experience things independent of my experience as a bodily engaged being in the world; the meaning I bring to my perception is a preceiving which is embodied.  It is by virtue of my embodiment that I can experience things as being up or down, as having insides or outsides, as being close or far away.  Space is always in relation to my body as situated within the world.  The same is true of time.  I can never be two places at once as a body.  I am always situated in the present, on the way somewhere as having been somewhere.  Thus, experience is always in the process of becoming.  Just when I am aware of things as determinate and thematic, new possibilities emerge on the horizon and the past fades away as more ambiguous.  Thus, when I experience a thing within a context, this spatial-temporal context is temporary and unfolding over time, and thus subject to change (within limits, of course--such becoming has a direction).  With the idea of the lived body, Merleau-Ponty solves Meno's paradox.  How do I know if I've found what I'm looking for? I know when I've found what I'm looking for because the world is already pregnant with meaning in relation to my body.  Things begin as ambiguous but become more determinate as I become bodily engaged with them.  On the other hand, I do not already know what I am looking for, because the world transcends my total grasp.  At any given time, the world as it is given includes not only what is revealed to me, but also what is concealed.  Merleau-Ponty, inspired by Husserl's concept of \"life-world,\" introduced his concept of the \"world-horizon. \" Things are always given to me within a world, and this world has the structure of a horizon.  A thing given as determinate is always against the background of an indeterminate and ambiguous background or horizon.  The configuration of this horizon (what Heidegger similarly refers to as our \"referential context of significance\") is constantly changing depending on the context.  What was determinate becomes indeterminate and what was indeterminate becomes determinate.  Merleau-Ponty also makes a distinction between the pre-reflective and the reflective.  When we reflect on experience, what we reflect on is viewed as hard-edged and determinate; as having definite dimensions and specific meanings.  This reflected experience can be determinate and hard-edged only against an indeterminate, ambiguous horizon or background.  Experience is then built upon an orginal, pre-reflective, ambiguous ground which is the world-horizon.  Experience begins in the pre-reflective, and reflection is always an abstract derivative of this primordial, pre-reflective, lived experience (the ready-to-hand).  Reflection is like the map compared to the unreflected as the country-side.  Merleau-Ponty's philsophy is much richer than I can do justice to here.  But one application is to understand the psychoanalytic unconscious from a phenomenological perspective.  As we've seen, for Merleau-Ponty, lived experience is prior to abstract reflection; it is pre-thematic.  We live it, but don't explicitly think about and calculate what we are doing.  When I am most typically engaged in a task, I do not reflect on the task, and this mode of ready-to-hand engagement is the primordial, experiential ground which makes reflection possible.  Whenever we reflect intellectually on experience, we have to go back to the lived world of our experience prior to that reflection.  This is a way to think about the unconscious without necessarily buying into a Freudian meta-psychology.  From this perspective, the unconscious can be viewed as the pre-thematic, pre-objective, lived, concrete, latent experience of our engagement with the world (with others and alongside things) prior to reflection.  It is what we live out but do not speak or think.  When we thematize it, bring it to reflection, we make it thematic or \"conscious. \" From here, we can understand repression as a lived, pre-reflective and motivated refusal to thematize or reflect on that lived experience ( Sartre called this \"bad faith. \").  Robert Romanyshyn gives an excellent example of this.  He gives an example of a woman who is walking down the street.  Whenever a man walks by her, she unreflectively pulls her coat across her breasts in order to hide her breasts.  She is not reflectively aware of doing this, but at a bodily, lived level of engagement, this is an intentional, meaningful act, even if pre-reflective.  Now, suppose someone notices this and calls it to her attention.  She may then, perhaps even with suprise, note that she was not aware of this act.  Yet if she explored this, she would likely discover that this pre-reflective act is meaningful and has a history.  One can imagine that the woman sees men as sexual predators who objectify her body and are a threat.  The act of covering her breasts is an act which disallows her breasts to be objectified by the gaze of those men.  If we explored further with this woman, we may find that she had been raped in the past and that the man who raped her had stared at her breasts prior to violating her.  All of this history is contained in that lived, embodied, pre-reflective act of covering her breasts as she walks down the street.  Merleau-Ponty would say that our history becomes \"sedimented\" in our bodily gestures, contained there as latent and unreflected upon even though it is meaningful and lived out in the world.  To make these meanings thematic and subject to reflection is the process of, in a sense, making the \"unconscious\" \"conscious\"--or making the pre-thematic thematic.  There is a kind of freedom in this: in freeing her lived, prereflective experience to the level of thematic reflection, what had previously been lived prereflectively can then be subject to a choice.  The woman may choose to no longer fear men, to move beyond her aweful past, and to cease her previously latent act of covering her breasts, if she wishes to do so.  This is at least one way to view a phenomenologically-oriented psychotherapy, without resorting to Freudian meta-psychology.  With this phenomenological understanding of the unconscious, we can understand the unconscious as a \"lateral depth. \" Click on this link for Merleau-Ponty quotes LINKS Merleau-Ponty at the Realm of Existentialism Lechte on Merleau-Ponty Wyatt on Merleau-Ponty Hartman on Merleau-Ponty Nakayama's Merleau-Ponty page Merleau-Ponty at Encyclopedia. com Merleau-Ponty from Encyclopedia Brittannica Merleau-Ponty at Encarta Biography of Merleau-Ponty Craig Bachellor on Merleau-Ponty and Sartre The Structure of Behavior by Maurice Merleau-Ponty Merleau-Ponty on Aphasia \"The Paranoid-Schizoid and Depressive Positions in the Psychogenesis of the Self\" by Brent Dean Robbins \"Existential Phenomenology and Cognitive Science\" by Mark Wrathall and Sean Kelly \"The Current Relevance of Merleau-Ponty's Phenomenology of Embodiment\" by Hubert L.

However, he never propounded quite the same extreme accounts of radical freedom, being-towards-death, anguished responsibility, and conflicting relations with others, for which existentialism became both famous and notorious in the 1940s and 1950s.  Perhaps because of this, he did not initially receive the same amount of attention as his French contemporaries and friends, Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir.  These days though, his phenomenological analyses are arguably being given more attention than either, in both France and in the Anglo-American context, because they retain an ongoing relevance in fields as diverse as cognitive science, medical ethics, ecology, sociology and psychology.  Although it is difficult to summarize Merleau-Pontys work into neat propositions, we can say that he sought to develop a radical re-description of embodied experience (with a primacy given to studies of perception), and argued that these phenomena could not be suitably understood by the philosophical tradition because of its tendency to drift between two flawed and equally unsatisfactory alternatives: empiricism and, what he called, intellectualism.  This article will seek to explain his understanding of perception, bodily movement, habit, ambiguity, and relations with others, as they were expressed in his key early work, Phenomenology of Perception, before exploring the enigmatic ontology of the chiasm and the flesh that is so evocatively described in his unfinished book, The Visible and the Invisible.  Table of Contents 1.  Life and Works Maurice Merleau-Ponty was born on March 14th 1908, and like many others of his generation, his father was killed in World War I.  He completed his philosophy education at the Ecole Normale Superieure in 1930, and rather rapidly became one of the foremost French philosophers of the period during, and immediately following World War II, where he also served in the infantry.  As well as being Chair of child psychology at Sorbonne in 1949, he was the youngest ever Chair of philosophy at the College de France when he was awarded this position in 1952.  He continued to fulfill this role until his untimely death in 1961, and was also a major contributor for the influential political, literary, and philosophical magazine that was Les Temps Modernes.  While he repeatedly refused to be explicitly named as an editor alongside his friend and compatriot Jean-Paul Sartre, he was at least as important behind the scenes.  Along with Sartre, he has frequently been associated with the philosophical movement existentialism, though he never propounded quite the same extreme accounts of freedom, anguished responsibility, and conflicting relations with others, for which existentialism became both famous and notorious.  Indeed, he spent much of his career contesting and reformulating many of Sartres positions, including a sustained critique of what he saw as Sartres dualist and Cartesian ontology.  He also came to disagree with Sartres rather hard-line Marxism, and this was undoubtedly a major factor in what was eventually a rather acrimonious ending to their friendship.  For Merleau-Pontys assessment of their differences see Adventures of the Dialectic, but for Sartres version of events, see Situations.  While he died before completing his final opus that sought to completely reorient philosophy and ontology (The Visible and the Invisible), his work retains an importance to contemporary European philosophy.  Having been one of the first to bring structuralism and the linguistic emphasis of thinkers like Saussure into a relationship with phenomenology, his influence is still considerable, and an increasing amount of scholarship is being devoted to his works.  His philosophy was heavily influenced by the work of Husserl, and his own particular brand of phenomenology was preoccupied with refuting what he saw as the twin tendencies of Western philosophy; those being empiricism, and what he termed intellectualism, but which is more commonly referred to as idealism.  He sought to rearticulate the relationship between subject and object, self and world, among various other dualisms, and his early and middle work did so primarily through an account of the lived and existential body (see The Phenomenology of Perception).  He argued that the significance of the body, or the body-subject as he sometimes referred to it, is too often underestimated by the philosophical tradition which has a tendency to consider the body simply as an object that a transcendent mind orders to perform varying functions.  In this respect, his work was heavily based upon accounts of perception, and tended towards emphasizing an embodied inherence in the world that is more fundamental than our reflective capacities, though he also claims that perception is itself intrinsically cognitive.  His work is often associated with the idea of the 'primacy of perception, though rather than rejecting scientific and analytic ways of knowing the world, Merleau-Ponty simply wanted to argue that such knowledge is always derivative in relation to the more practical exigencies of the bodys exposure to the world.  2.  Early Philosophy When asked whether he was contemplating retirement on account of illness and the ravages of advancing age, Pope John Paul II confirmed that he was, and bemoaned the fact that his body was no longer a docile instrument, but a cage.  Although it is difficult to deny that a docile body that can be used instrumentally might be preferable to its decaying alternative-a body that prevents us acting as we might wish to-both positions are united by a very literal adherence to the mind-body duality, and the subordination of one term of that duality; the body.  Of course, such a dualistic way of thinking, and the denunciation of the body that it usually entails, is certainly not restricted to religious traditions.  This denigration of embodiment governs most metaphysical thought, and perhaps even most philosophical thought, until at least Nietzsche.  Even Heideggers philosophy has been accused of deferring the question of the body, and a non-dualistic exploration of our embodied experience seems to be a project of some importance, and it is one that preoccupied Maurice Merleau-Ponty throughout his entire career.  While a major figure in French phenomenology, Merleau-Ponty, at least until relatively recently, has rarely been accorded the amount of attention of many of his compatriots.  In my opinion, this has been a considerable oversight, as it is doubtful that any other philosopher, phenomenologist or otherwise, has ever paid such sustained attention to the significance of the body in relation to the self, to the world, and to others.  There is no relation or aspect of his phenomenology which does not implicate the body, or what he terms the body-subject (which is later considered in terms of his more general notion of the flesh), and significantly, his descriptions allow us to reconceive the problem of embodiment in terms of the bodys practical capacity to act, rather than in terms of any essential trait.  In the Phenomenology of Perception, which is arguably his major work, Merleau-Ponty sets about exposing the problematic nature of traditional philosophical dichotomies and, in particular, that apparently age-old dualism involving the mind and the body.  It is no accident that consideration of this dualism plays such an important role in all of his work, since the constitution of the body as an 'object is also a pivotal moment in the construction of the idea of an objective world which exists 'out there (PP 72).  Once this conception of the body is problematized, so too, according to Merleau-Ponty, is the whole idea of an outside world that is entirely distinguishable from the thinking subject.  Merleau-Ponty criticizes the tendency of philosophy to fall within two main categories, neither of which is capable of shedding much light on the problems that it seeks to address.  He is equally critical of the rationalist, Cartesian accounts of humanity, as well as the more empirical and behavioristic attempts to designate the human condition.  Rationalism is problematic because it ignores our situation, and consequently the contingent nature of thought, when it makes the world, or at least meaning, the immanent property of the reflecting mind.  One quote from Descartes is illustrative of this type of attitude: \"If I chance to look out of the window onto men passing in the street, I do not fail to say, on seeing them, that I see men. . .  and yet, what do I see from this window, other than hats and cloaks, which cover ghosts or dummies who move only by means of springs? But I judge them to be really men, and thus I understand, by the sole power of judgment that resides in my mind, what I believed I saw with my eyes\" (Crossley 10).  Descartes prioritizing of the mental above the physical (and indeed the duality itself), is very obvious here and this is something that Merleau-Ponty strongly rejects.  As well as being unjust to existential experience, it also leaves the problem of meaningful judgment untouched.  The account presupposes the meaningful judgment of hats and cloaks, rather than explaining how this perception could actually be meaningful.  We shall return to such criticisms of Cartesianism throughout this chapter, but for the time being it is more important for us to have an accurate understanding of where Merleau-Ponty situates his philosophy, than it is for us to have a systematic comprehension of exactly why he refutes rationalism, or what he terms intellectualism.  According to Merleau-Ponty, empiricism also makes our cultural world an illusion, by ignoring the internal connection between the object and the act.  For him, perception is not merely the result of the functioning of individual organs, but also a vital and performative human act in which \"I\" perceive through the relevant organs.  Each of the senses informs the others in virtue of their common behavioral project, or concern with a certain human endeavor, and perception is inconceivable without this complementary functioning.  Empiricism generally ignores this, and Merleau-Ponty contends that whatever their efficacy in explaining certain phenomena, these type of scientific and analytic causalities cannot actually appraise meaning and human action.  As one critic points out, \"if we attempt to localize and sectionalize the various activities which manifest themselves at the bodily level, we lose the signification of the action itself\" (Barral 94).  In the terms of Merleau-Pontys later philosophy, such an analysis would \"recuperate everything except itself as an effort of recuperation, it would clarify everything except its own role\" (VI 33).  The main point to extract from this is that, for Merleau-Ponty, both empiricism and intellectualism are eminently flawed positions: \"In the first case consciousness is too poor, in the second too rich for any phenomenon to appeal compellingly to it.  Empiricism cannot see that we need to know what we are looking for, otherwise we would not be looking for it, and intellectualism fails to see that we need to be ignorant of what we are looking for, or equally again we should not be searching\" (PP 28).  It is not difficult to see why Merleau-Ponty would be preoccupied with undermining such dichotomous tendencies.  Essentially it ensures that one exists as a constituting thing (subject) or as a thing (object).  Moreover, that perennial philosophical debate regarding whether humanity is free or determined is more than tangentially related, and all of these issues seem to be inextricably intertwined in what Foucault aptly terms the \"empirico-transcendental doublet of modern thought. \" This ontological dualism of immanence and transcendence - see mind/body, thought/language, self/world, inside/outside - is at the forefront of all of Merleau-Pontys attempts to re-orientate philosophy.  While Merleau-Ponty does not want to simplistically deny the possibility of cognitive relations between subject and object, he does want to repudiate the suggestion that these facts are phenomenologically primitive.  It may be useful, in a particular situation, to conceive of a seer and a seen, a subject and an object.  Many scientific endeavors fruitfully rely upon the methodological ideal of a detached consciousness observing brute facts about the world.  Merleau-Ponty can accommodate this, provided that the terms of such dualities are recognized to be relationally constituted.  In other words, for him, the seer and the seen condition one another and, of course, there is an obvious sense in which our capacity for seeing does depend on our capacity for being seen - that is, being physically embodied in what Merleau-Ponty has occasionally described as an 'inter-individual world.  In this repudiation of traditional metaphysical philosophy and its governing subject-object relationship, it is perhaps unsurprising that Merleau-Ponty, when speaking of his phenomenological method, suggests that \"the demand for a pure description excludes equally the procedure of analytical reflection on the one hand, and that of scientific explanation on the other\" (PP ix).  Only by avoiding these tendencies, according to him, can we \"rediscover, as anterior to the ideas of subject and object, the fact of my subjectivity and the nascent object, that primordial layer at which both things and ideas come into being\" (PP 219).  The Phenomenology of Perception is hence united by the claim that we are our bodies, and that our lived experience of this body denies the detachment of subject from object, mind from body, etc (PP xii).  In this embodied state of being where the ideational and the material are intimately linked, human existence cannot be conflated into any particular paradigm, for as Nick Crossley suggests, \"there is no meaning which is not embodied, nor any matter that is not meaningful\" (Crossley 14).  It should be clear from this that Merleau-Pontys statement that 'I am my body cannot simply be interpreted as advocating a materialist, behaviorist type position.  He does not want to deny or ignore those aspects of our life which are commonly called the 'mental - and what would be left if he did? - but he does want to suggest that the use of this 'mind is inseparable from our bodily, situated, and physical nature.  This means simply that the perceiving mind is an incarnated body, or to put the problem in another way, he enriches the concept of the body to allow it to both think and perceive.  It is also for these reasons that we are best served by referring to the individual as not simply a body, but as a body-subject.  Virtually the entirety of the Phenomenology of Perception is devoted to illustrating that the body cannot be viewed solely as an object, or material entity of the world.  Perception has been a prominent theme in Merleau-Pontys attempts to establish this, and even in his latest work, he still holds its primacy as our clearest relationship to Being, and in which the inadequacy of dualistic thinking is most explicitly revealed.  However, despite the titles of two of his major works (Phenomenology of Perception and The Primacy of Perception), perception, at least as the term is usually construed, is paradoxically enough, not really a guiding principle in his work.  This is because the practical modes of action of the body-subject are inseparable from the perceiving body-subject (or at least mutually informing), since it is precisely through the body that we have access to the world.  Perception hence involves the perceiving subject in a situation, rather than positioning them as a spectator who has somehow abstracted themselves from the situation.  There is hence an interconnection of action and perception, or as Merleau-Ponty puts it, \"every perceptual habituality is still a motor habit\" (PP 153).  This ensures that there is no lived distinction between the act of perceiving and the thing perceived.  This will become clearer in his later philosophy, where the figure of the chiasm becomes an important ontological motif for explaining how and why this is the case.  At this stage however, it suffices to recognize that for Merleau-Ponty, \"in the natural attitude, I do not have perceptions\" (PP 281).  Moreover, in the \"Working Notes\" of his final, unfinished work, The Visible and the Invisible, he states that \"we exclude the term perception to the whole extent that it already implies a cutting up of what is lived into discontinuous acts, or a reference to things whose status is not specified, or simply an opposition between the visible and the invisible\" (VI 157-8).  Hence, as Gary Madison has pointed out, \"what traditionally has been referred to as 'perception, no longer figures in Merleau-Pontys post-foundationalist mode of thinking\" (MPHP 83).  To the degree that we can actually speak of Merleau-Pontys account of perception, it essentially suggests the same thing as the rest of his work (and despite the incredible breadth and perspicacity of his work, one cannot deny that the Phenomenology of Perception is repetitious); it criticizes our tendency to bifurcate between two positions.  Merleau-Ponty suggests that; \"We started off from a world in itself which acted upon our eyes so as to cause us to see it, and now we have consciousness of, or thought about the world, but the nature of the world remains unchanged; it is still defined by the absolute mutual exteriority of its parts, and is merely duplicated throughout its extent by a thought which sustains it\" (PP 39).  In other words, the common perceptual paradigm that involves passively seeing something and then interpreting that biological perception is, for Merleau-Ponty, a false one.  The presumption is still that one exists either as a thing, or as a consciousness (PP 198), but the perceiving body-subject conforms to neither of this positions; its mode of existence is manifestly more complicated and ambiguous.  As hard as we may try, we cannot see the broken shards of a beer bottle as simply the sum of its color, shape etc.  The whole background apparatus of what that bottle is used for, what consuming the liquids contained therein means for different people, what it is for something to be 'broken etc, comes with, and not behind, our perception of that bottle.  For Merleau-Ponty, perception cannot be characterized as a type of thought in a classical, reflective sense, but equally clearly, it is also far from being a third person process where we attain access to some rarefied, pure object.  Just as for Heidegger we cannot hear pure noise but always a noise of some activity, the objects that we encounter in the world are always of a particular kind and relevant to certain human intentions (explicit or otherwise), and we cannot step outside this instrumentality to some realm of purified objects or, for that matter, thought.  Perception then, is not merely passive before sensory stimulation, but as Merleau-Ponty suggests, is a \"creative receptivity\".  In this respect, it is interesting to observe that our modern vernacular incorporates this more 'active and appropriative dimension of perception.  After all, one is often commended for 'perceptive observations, and for this to function as a compliment at all, it must admit of an individuals creative influence, and hence some responsibility, over the manner in which they perceive.  More empirically, it is also worth pointing out that if we were merely passive before a sensory image, it would not be possible to see different aspects of things as we so often do, or for that matter, for different individuals to construe a particular representation differently.  Consider Jastrows/Wittgensteins famous example in which a picture can be variously interpreted as a duck or a rabbit, or the prominent psychological diagram that highlights the capacity of an individual to see a vase at one moment and two faces confronting one another at the next, depending upon which part of the diagram they determine to be the background.  These experiential studies seem to reinforce Merleau-Pontys fundamental point that we are not simply passive before sensorial stimulation, since the visual experience seems to change, and yet nothing changes optically with respect to color, shape or distance.  What we literally see, or notice, is hence not simply the objective world, but is conditioned by a myriad of factors that ensures that the relationship between perceiving subject and object perceived is not one of exclusion.  Rather, each term exists only through its dialectical relation to the other, and from this analysis of the perceiving body-subject, Merleau-Ponty enigmatically concludes that \"Inside and outside are inseparable.  The world is wholly inside and I am wholly outside myself\" (PP 407).  For Merleau-Ponty, this inseparability of inner and outer ensures that a study of the perceived ends up revealing the subject perceiving.  As he puts it, \"the body will draw to itself the intentional threads which bind it to its surroundings and finally will reveal to us the perceiving subject as the perceived world\" (PP).  It is precisely this ambiguous intertwining of inner and outer, as it is revealed in a phenomenological analysis of the body, which the intellectualism of philosophy cannot appreciate.  According to Merleau-Ponty, philosophers of reflection ignore the paradoxical condition of all human subjectivity: that is, the fact that we are both a part of the world and coextensive with it, constituting but also constituted (PP 453).  However, if perception is not grounded in either an objective or subjective component (for example, it is not objectively received before a subjective interpretation), but by a reciprocal openness which resides between such categories, it may be remarked that this would seem to endow perception with an instability that it clearly doesnt have.  Merleau-Pontys philosophy has the means to cater for this stability though.  His analysis of the bodys tendency to seek an equilibrium through skilful coping, or what he somewhat problematically terms \"habituality,\" affirms how perception is learnt, primarily through imitation, in an embodied and communal environment.  While perception is subject to change, just as communities can change over periods of time, this possibility certainly does not allow for wild fluctuations in perceptive experience from one moment to the next.  Habit, and the production of schemes in regards to the bodys mobilization, \"gives our life the form of generality and prolongs our personal acts into stable dispositions\" (PP 146).  This tendency of our body to seek its own equilibrium and to form habits, is an infinitely important component of Merleau-Pontys body-subject, and it is a theme that we will return to.  For the moment however, we must return to other manifestations of Merleau-Pontys argument for the body-subject.  Another idea of central significance for him is the fact that the body is always there, and that its absence (and to a certain degree also its variation) is inconceivable (PP 91).  It means that we cannot treat the body as an object available for perusal, which can or cannot be part of our world, since it is not something that we can possibly do with out.  It is the mistake of classical psychology, not to mention the empiricism of all sciences, that it treats the body as an object, when for Merleau-Ponty, an object \"is an object only insofar as it can be moved away from me. . .  Its presence is such that it entails a possible absence.  Now the permanence of my body is entirely different in kind\" (PP 90).  It is inordinately difficult to fault this claim that the omnipresence of our body prevents us treating it simply as an object of the world, even though such an apparently axiomatic position is not always recognized by traditional philosophy, as we have already seen exemplified by both Descartes, and Pope John Paul II.  Another factor against conceiving of the body as being completely constituted, and an object in-itself, is the fact that it is that by which there are objects.  Our motility, that is, our capability of bodily movement, testifies that the body cannot be the mere servant of consciousness, since \"in order that we may be able to move our body towards an object, the object must first exist for it, our body must not belong to the realm of the in-itself\" (PP 139).  This Sartrean term will be accorded with more significance as we progress, but for the moment, one only need see that Merleau-Ponty is making explicit that the aspects of an object revealed to an individual are dependent upon their bodily position.  For him, it is also clear that we are not accorded quite the same privilege in viewing our own bodies, as we have in viewing other 'objects.  For Merleau-Ponty, this is because \"the presentation of objects in perspective cannot be understood except through the resistance of my body to all variation of perspective\" (PP 92).  We cannot see our body as the other does, and as Merleau-Ponty says, \"the reflection of the body upon itself always miscarries at the last minute\" (VI 9).  I think it is relatively clear that we do need the other to attain to true awareness of ourselves as a body-subject.  Even our vision of ourselves in a mirror is always mediated by body image, and hence by the other, and it would seem that we cant look at our own mirror image in quite the same way that we can appreciate the appearance of others.  These more existential aspects of our existence suggest that there is something fundamentally true about Merleau-Pontys more general suggestion that our body should be conceived of as our means of communication with the world, rather than merely as an object of the world which our transcendent mind orders to perform varying functions.  Merleau-Ponty offers one particularly good example of the body as a means of communication, which also makes it clear that a subject-object model of exchange tends to deprive the existential phenomena of their true complexity.  He suggests that: \"If I touch with my left hand my right hand while it touches an object, the right hand object is not the right hand touching: the first is an intertwining of bones, muscles and flesh bearing down on a point in space, the second traverses space as a rocket in order to discover the exterior object in its place\" (PP 92).  More significantly, the hand touching itself represents the bodys capacity to occupy the position of both perceiving object and subject of perception, if not at once, then in a constant oscillation.  However, as he puts it, \"when I press my two hands together, it is not a matter of two sensations felt together as one perceives two objects placed side by side, but an ambiguous set-up in which both hands can alternate the role of 'touching and being 'touched'\" (PP 93).  Mark Yount expresses Merleau-Pontys point well, when he suggests that \"the reflexivity of this touching-touched exceeds the logic of dichotomy: the two are not entirely distinguished, since the roles can be reversed; but the two are not identical, since touching and touched can never fully coincide\" (MPHP 216-7).  This double touching and encroachment of the touching onto the touched (and vice versa), where subject and object cannot be unequivocally discerned, is considered to be representative of perception and sensibility generally.  Pre-empting the more explicit ontology of The Visible and the Invisible (and with which we shall become increasingly concerned), Merleau-Ponty hence tacitly argues for the \"reversibility\" of the body, its capacity to be both sentient and sensible, and reaffirms his basic contention that incarnate consciousness is the central phenomena of which mind and body are abstract moments (PP 193).  a.  Habit However, Merleau-Ponty has another vitally important and related point to make about the status of our bodies, which precludes them from being categorized simply as objects.  According to him, we move directly and in union with our bodies.  As he points out, \"I do not need to lead it (the body) towards a movements completion, it is in contact with it from the start and propels itself towards that end\" (PP 94, my italics).  In other words, we do not need to check to see if we have two legs before we stand up, since we are necessarily with our bodies.  The consequences of this simple idea however, are more extensive than one may presume.  On a more complicated level, the sporting arena testifies to this being with our bodies, as does the wave, or other gesture, that simply responds to given circumstances without the intervention of traditional philosophical conceptions of thought and/or intention.  For instance, the basketball player who says that they are \"in the zone\" perceives the terrain in accordance with some general intentions, but these are modified by the situation in which they find themselves.  Their actions are solicited by the situations that confront them, in a constantly evolving way.  Interestingly enough, in The Structure of Behavior, Merleau-Ponty also makes use of a sporting analogy.  He suggests that: \"For the player in action the football field is not an 'object, that is, the ideal term which can give rise to a multiplicity of perspectival views and remain equivalent under its apparent transformations.  It is pervaded with lines of force (the 'yard lines; those which demarcate the penalty area) and articulated in sectors (for example, the 'openings between the adversaries) which call for a certain mode of action and which initiate and guide the action as if the player were unaware of it.  The field itself is not given to him, but present as the immanent term of his practical intentions; the player becomes one with it and feels the direction of the goal, for example just as immediately as the vertical and horizontal planes of his own body\" (SB 168).  This passage implies that to perceive the football pitch it is not necessary that an individual be aware of perceiving it, but this is not the only significance of this revealed mode of being.  The perceptions/actions of the sportsperson reveal a form of intelligence that informs much of our everyday interaction, and that refutes many dichotomous positions (PP 142), most obvious among these being the insistence that a separate act of interpretation (to determine a goal or intention), is necessary to give action a meaningful form.  Moreover, Merleau-Pontys descriptions of sporting activity also imply that as we refine our skills for coping with existence (based upon past experiences), scenarios show up as soliciting those acquired skilful responses, and it is this aspect of his work that attracts Hubert Dreyfus attention.  For Dreyfus, this \"skilful coping does not require a mental representation of its goal.  It can be purposive without the agent entertaining a purpose\" and this pre-reflective mode of existence reveals many of the postulations of dualistic thinking as abstractions.  Moreover, if this purposive action without a purpose (other than best accommodating oneself to the situation in which one is immersed), is forestalled, say if a particular golfer starts to ponder the intricacies of their swing, where their feet are positioned, mental outlook etc, rather than simply responding, it is certainly probable that they will lose form.  So what, one may ask? According to Merleau-Ponty, the point is that \"whether a system of motor or perceptual powers, our body is not an object for an 'I think, it is a grouping of lived-through meanings which moves towards its equilibrium\" (PP 153).  The emphasis upon rationalistic thought, and its tendency to dissect human behavior through the 'I think, can conspire to turn us away from the bodys acclimatization to its own environment.  Merleau-Ponty hence seems to explore a more basic motivation for human action than is usually taken to be the case.  Rather than focusing upon our desire to attain certain pleasures or achieve certain goals, his analysis reveals the bodys more primordial tendency to form intentional arcs, and to try and achieve an equilibrium with the world.  Through reference to embodied activity, Merleau-Ponty makes it clear that our actions, and the perceptions involved in those actions, are largely habitual; learnt through imitation, and responsiveness within an environment and to a community.  Indeed, without such a pre-reflective base, language-games would be unlearnable, and as Wittgenstein was also beginning to do at virtually the same historical moment (the early 1940s), Merleau-Ponty hence emphasizes the philosophical importance of the act of learning, and by implication, training.  According to him, philosophy has generally been unable to adequately address these phenomena (PP 142), and it is worth repeating what I take to be an important sentence from the Phenomenology of Perception.  Merleau-Ponty suggests that empiricism and intellectualism (the two logical outcomes of metaphysical thought), \"are in agreement in that neither can grasp consciousness in the act of learning, and that neither attaches due importance to that circumscribed ignorance, that still empty but always determinate intention which is attention itself\" (PP 28).  This emphasis upon consciousness in the act learning, is also what Dreyfus is intent on exploring in relation to Merleau-Pontys philosophy, and he agrees that in the act of learning, consciousness is irremediably embodied.  Dreyfus asks, \"if everything is similar to everything else in an indefinitely large number of ways, what constrains the space of possible generalizations so that trial and error learning has a chance of succeeding? Here is where the body comes in\".  It is worth suggesting that this might apply equally if everything is dissimilar, other to everything else - the body narrows this disparate range of phenomena down, or more accurately, renders them intelligible.  Our skilful embodiment makes it possible for us to encounter \"more and more differentiated solicitations to act\", and enables us to react to situations, in ways that have previously proved successful, and which do not require purposive thought.  However, in order to begin to fathom what Dreyfus \"embodied solicitations to act\" might involve, it is worth contemplating the suggestion of another commentator, who also emphasizes the importance of the body in learning: \"Movements of the body are developed almost without conscious effort, in most cases.  There seems to be a sort of intelligence of the body: a new dance is learned without analyzing the sequence of movements.  Children learn dances very easily and well. . .  This is also the reason why habits can be formed: the body seems to have understood and retained the new meaning\" (Barral 137).  From this description, we can ascertain that it is usually not through conscious reflection and analysis that a dance or other language-game is learnt, but through repeated embodied efforts that are modified until the \"right\" movements are achieved.  This intelligence of the body (for example, its capacity to innovate and retain new meaning), again denies the heavy emphasis that much of the philosophical tradition has placed upon interpretation, and certainly any conception of interpretation that contrasts itself with a purely passive perception.  This can also be envisaged as applying just as well to the intellectual, as it does to the dancer.  In reacting to their own different, but nevertheless distinct set of influences, they still choose modes of action in relation to past success.  Even in the most apparently 'thoughtful of activities, the body inclines itself towards an equilibrium.  It is worth making explicit that this habit to which we are referring, is far from being merely a mechanistic or behaviorist propensity to pursue a certain line of action.  Our habitual mode of being is constantly being altered (in however small a way), and the point is that habit is far more akin to a competence, or a \"flexible skill, a power of action and reaction\" (Crossley 12), which can be mobilied under different conditions to achieve different effects (PP 143).  However, we may want to ask, as Merleau-Ponty does, \"if habituality is neither a form of knowledge nor an involuntary action, what is it then?\" According to him, \"it is knowledge in the hands, which is forthcoming only when bodily effort is made, and cannot be formulated in detachment from that effort\" (PP 144).  Merleau-Ponty suggests that this type of \"knowledge in the hands\" is primordial, and he implies that if we completely detach ourselves from this habitual base, we risk embarking upon philosophic and scientific endeavors that are of no practical benefit, and that might also artificially serve to legitimize the mind-body dualism.  Another good example of this practical and embodied intelligence that Merleau-Ponty insistently points us towards, is the driving of a car.  We are intimately aware of how a particular cars gearshift needs to be treated, its ability to turn, accelerate, brake etc, and importantly, also of the dimensions of the vehicle.  When we reflect on our own parking, it is remarkable that there are so few little bumps considering how many times we are actually forced to come very close.  Indeed, even when reversing many drivers need not really monitor the progress of their car, because they 'know (in the sense of a harmony between aim and intention) what result the various movements of the steering wheel are likely to induce.  The car is absorbed into our body schema with almost the same precision that we have regarding our own spatiality.  It becomes an \"area of sensitivity\" which extends \"the scope and active radius of the touch\" (PP 143) and rather than thinking about the car, it is more accurate to suggest that we think from the point of view of the car, and consequently also perceive our environment in a different way (Crossley 12).  Notably, this thinking is not reflective or interpretive - we do not have to perceive the distance to a car park, and then reflect upon the fact that we are in a car of such and such proportions, before the delicate maneuver can be attempted.  Rather, it is a practical mastery of a technique which ensures that the given rules can be followed blindly (or at least without reflective thought), and yet nevertheless with an embodied intelligence.  In one paragraph from the Phenomenology of Perception, Merleau-Ponty captures the issues at hand particularly well.  He observes that: \"We said earlier that it is the body which \"understands\" in the acquisition of habituality.  This way of putting it will appear absurd, if understanding is subsuming a sense datum under an idea, and if the body is an object.  But the phenomenon of habituality is just what prompts us to revise our notion of \"understand\" and our notion of the body.  To understand is to experience harmony between what we aim at and what is given, between the intention and the performance - and the body is our anchorage in the world\" (PP 144).  In this paragraph, Merleau-Ponty defines understanding as a harmony between what we aim at and what is given, between intention and performance, and this also sheds some light upon his suggestion that consciousness is primarily not a matter of \"I think that\", but of \"I can\" (PP 137).  Action in this paradigm is spontaneous and practical, and it is clear that we move phenomenally in a manner somewhat antithetical to the mind-body distinction (PP 145).  However, it is worth pointing out that while habit and the tendency to seek an equilibrium might help us adjust to the circumstances of our world, they dont simply make things easy.  For Merleau-Ponty, \"what enables us to centre our existence is also what prevents us from centering it completely, and the anonymity of our body is inseparably both freedom and servitude\" (PP 85).  Merleau-Pontys point seems to be that though the body searches for equilibrium, as a mortal and temporal body it is also precluded from perpetual equilibrium (cf PP 346).  Merleau-Pontys claim that knowing is far from an imperative for human action will be considered in greater detail throughout, but for the moment it is more important to consider some other consequences of his account of embodiment, particularly in relation to his suggestion that we move spontaneously, and pre-reflectively, in accord with our bodies.  According to his version of the pre-reflective cogito, when one motions towards a friend to come nearer, there is no preceding or ancillary thought prepared within me which motivates my action (PP 111).  I do not perceive a certain signal in my mind and then decide to act on it, or if I do, it is a rare and derivative occurrence.  According to Merleau-Ponty, the immense difference posited by the philosophical tradition between thinking and perceiving (and of course, mind and body), is hence revealed as a mistake.  However, this suggestion that pre-reflective existence does not require interpretation, or any prior formulation of intention, is an important one and deserving of prolonged consideration.  Insisting that we cannot discern an interior state that precedes the expression of that state, Merleau-Ponty suggests that \"I am not in front of my body, I am in it or rather I am it. . .  If we can still speak of interpretation in relation to the perception of ones own body, we shall have to say that it interprets itself\" (PP 150).  One would struggle to envisage a much closer relationship to the body than that, and Merleau-Ponty elsewhere goes so far as to suggest that: \"Nothing is changed when the subject is charged with interpreting his reactions himself, which is what is proper to introspection.  When he is asked if he can read the letters inscribed on a panel or distinguish the details of a shape, he will not trust a vague \"impression of legibility\".  He will attempt to read or describe what is presented to him\" (SB 183).  According to Merleau-Ponty then, there is no 'mental correlate of reading that makes it possible to definitively know that reading is taking place.  Faced with the demand that they prove that they have actually read, an individual can only refer, with circularity, to the words that have read themselves, repeating what is in front of him or her.  If further justification is demanded, eventually one can respond only by pointing out that \"this is simply what I do\", and that these are the practices that I engage in.  Refusing to accord the 'mental any privileged status, Merleau-Ponty even suggests that: \"If I try to study love or hate purely from inner observation, I will find very little to describe: a few pangs, a few heart throbs - in short, trite agitations which do not reveal the essence of love or hate. . .  We must reject the prejudice which makes \"inner realities\" out of love, hate or anger, leaving them accessible to one single witness: the person who feels them.  Anger, shame, hate and love are not psychic facts hidden at the bottom of anothers consciousness: they are types of behavior or styles of conduct which are visible from the outside\" (SNS 52-3).  Human subjectivity is no longer conceived of as residing in an inaccessible, private domain of the 'mental.  Rather, Merleau-Pontys notion of the body-subject entails an affirmation of public and surface interaction, and of the physiognomic qualities of our bodies.  This does not preclude deep feelings, but merely suggests that they must necessarily be manifested in our public lives.  A disturbance aroused in the affective life of an individual will have correlative repercussions in the physical, perceptive, and expressive life of that person.  This will obviously have significant ramifications for how we conceive of relationships with the other, but these are not merely flippant remarks designed only to refute intellectualism and empiricism.  Merleau-Ponty has thought through the consequences and recognizes, for example, that the Japanese express the emotion of love in significantly different ways to the archetypal French or Australian citizen.  But for him this cultural variance, \"or to be more precise, this difference of behavior, corresponds to a difference in the emotions themselves.  It is not only the gesture that is contingent in relation to the bodys organization, it is the manner itself in which we meet the situation and live it. . . .  Feelings and passional conduct are invented like words\" (PP 189).  This quote is slightly misleading, because Merleau-Pontys philosophy of situation does not want to suggest that either passional conduct, or words for that matter, can simply be constructed from nothing by a self-actualized individual.  The word invention, which seems to imply an individual inventing something, is the problematic term here.  Both passional conduct and words however, are invented, but by a community, and hence subtend any individual existence.  b.  Philosophy and Reflection However, for some critics Merleau-Pontys notion of the body-subject, and his emphasis upon the intentional arc that inclines one towards an equilibrium and tacitly suggests the derivative nature of thought and interpretation, induces a picture of humanity that is too easy, and not reflective enough.  There is, after all, a tendency to interpret his position as being an advocacy of simple, spontaneous relations, and a nostalgic desire for some primordial inherence in Being.  It has been suggested that Merleau-Pontys phenomenology does not give the required amount of attention to reflection, and other factors that might complicate this spontaneous, pre-reflective state.  On the other hand, it might also be claimed that not only can Merleau-Pontys philosophy of situation accommodate rationality, it also consigns it to its proper place.  While in many ways his philosophy does affirm the primacy of perception (broadly construed to incorporate the practical action that it cannot be distinguished from), this doesnt simply come at the cost of sacrificing the validity of rational processes.  Rather, it attempts to ground them in our situation, and to reinforce that reflection should not feign ignorance of its origins in perceptual experience.  His point is simply that the \"I can\" precedes and conditions the possibility of the \"I know\" (PP 137).  As Merleau-Ponty states, there is \"a privilege of reason, but precisely in order to understand it properly, we must begin by replacing thought amongst the phenomena of perception\" (PrP 222).  Analytic thought, and philosophy per se, can and should be used to render pre-reflective experience intelligible, for as he points out: \"It is a question not of putting the perceptual faith in place of reflection, but on the contrary of taking into account the total situation, which involves reference from the one to the other.  What is given is not a massive and opaque world, or a universe of adequate thought; it is a reflection which turns back over the density of the world in order to clarify it, but which, coming second, reflects back to it only its own light\" (VI 35).  Indeed, despite the nostalgic yearning that Merleau-Ponty occasionally seems to have for a primordial union with the world, he nevertheless makes it clear that one never returns to immediate experience.  It is only a question of whether we are to try to understand it, and he believes that to attempt to express immediate experience is not to betray reason but, on the contrary, to work towards its aggrandizement.  Philosophy is hence a means to improve our ways of living, and reason has a role in this, providing that it is based in the phenomenological exigencies of the subject and their life-world.  While his philosophy is poised on the margins of philosophy and non-philosophy, it is not anti-philosophical in any respect.  c.  Ambiguity Moreover, Merleau-Ponty does not intend to suggest that the complicity of body and mind that we see in habit and the mastery of a certain technique, implies an absolute awareness of ones own 'subjectivity.  According to him, \"there is the absolute certitude of the world in general, but not of anything in particular\" (PP 344).  Knowing an individual person in a particular manifestation may presuppose an understanding of humanity in its totality, but certainly not any singular motivation for a particular act.  Lived relations can never be grasped perfectly by consciousness, since the body-subject is never entirely present-to-itself.  Meaningful behavior is lived through, rather than thematized and reflected upon, and this ensures that the actions of particular individuals \"may be meaningful without them being fully or reflectively aware of the meaning that their action creates or embodies.  In this sense, the behaving actor is not a fully-fledged subject in the Cartesian sense.  She is not fully transparent to herself\" (Crossley 12).  There is ambiguity then, precisely because we are not capable of disembodied reflection upon our activities, but are involved in an intentional arc that absorbs both our body and our mind (PP 136).  For Merleau-Ponty, both intellectualism and empiricism presuppose \"a universe perfectly explicit in itself\" (PP 41), but residing between these two positions, his body-subject actually requires ambiguity and, in a sense, indeterminacy.  According to Merleau-Ponty, ambiguity prevails both in my perception of things, and in the knowledge I have of myself, primarily because of our temporal situation which he insists cannot but be ambiguous.  He suggests that: \"My hold on the past and the future is precarious and my possession of my own time is always postponed until a stage when I may fully understand it, yet this stage can never be reached, since it would be one more moment bounded by the horizon of its future, and requiring in its turn, further developments in order to be understood\" (PP 346 cf 426).  In such sentiments Merleau-Ponty seems to be suggesting that the relationship that we have to ourselves is one that is always typified by alterity, on account of a temporal explosion towards the future that precludes us ever being self-present.  [The term \"alterity\" is basically synonymous with otherness and radical difference, but it also emphasizes change and transformation in a way that these terms might not. ] There can be no self-enclosed \"now\" moment because time also always has this reflexive aspect that is aware of itself, and that opens us to experiences beyond our particular horizons of significance.  Indeed, it is because of this temporal alterity, that Merleau-Ponty asserts that we can never say 'I absolutely (PP 208).  Rather, he suggests, \"I know myself only insofar as I am inherent in time and in the world, that is, I know myself only in my ambiguity\" (PP 345).  Elsewhere in the Phenomenology of Perception he goes on to imply that the subject is time and time is the subject (PP 431-2), and these sentiments are not that far from certain 'postmodern conceptions of subjectivity.  Moreover, the attempt to take seriously the notion of ambiguity would, or at least should, also involve the deconstruction of what is termed the 'metaphysics of presence.  Being the \"mark of a thought which is resolutely attempting to overcome oppositional thinking itself\" (MPHP 120), Merleau-Pontys emphasis upon ambiguity, if consistently adhered to, would seem capable of refuting the various readings of him that assert that he is overly preoccupied with presence.  Mary Barral puts Merleau-Pontys point exceedingly well, when she suggests that \"since we cannot remain in the alternative of either not understanding the subject, or of knowing nothing about the object, we must seek the object at the very heart of our experience. . .  to understand the paradox that there is a \"for-us\" of the \"in-itself\" (Barral 130 cf PP 71).  In other words, we must attain an understanding of what Merleau-Ponty describes elsewhere as \"the paradox of transcendence in immanence\" (PrP 16) - that is, to understand that objects are given over to us, influenced by us, just as we are influenced by the objects that surround us.  For Merleau-Ponty, this interdependence and mutual encroachment is evident in all aspects of perception and subjectivity.  As he makes clear, \"whenever I try to understand myself, the whole fabric of the perceptible world comes too, and with it comes the others who are caught in it (S 15).  In the concluding words of the Phenomenology of Perception he insists that \"man is a network of relations\" (PP 456), or \"man is a knot of relations\", depending upon the translation, and the strong implication of Merleau-Pontys philosophy is that this is not a knot (or network) of the Gordian variety, and that these relations are not something that we can, or even should, want to unravel.  The interdependence of the knot is what gives humanity its very qualities, and by dissecting it, we risk losing the very thing that establishes us as human.  But I think this point is best explored by Merleau-Ponty when he describes how in writing his philosophical texts, he might not necessarily have a precise idea of exactly where his discussion is leading but, \"as if by magic\", the words flow from him and slowly become a cogent whole (PP 177).  This is not to be dismissed as merely being symptomatic of a supposed continental lack of philosophical rigor.  All papers, analytic or otherwise, are not written in the head, entirely worked out, before they are laid down.  The process of laying them down inevitably effects alterations.  Merleau-Ponty embraces this aspect of writing, and he doesnt consider it merely the derivative attempt to faithfully transcribe some self-present thought.  However, there is also the further point that where exactly the written creation derives from (the particular word, as much as the whole book) is a fundamentally ambiguous point, since it is neither the self-present subject, nor the cultural world, which determines the product, but the knot, the sum relation of all networks.  Again, this also necessitates a certain ambiguity at the heart of our experience.  Trying to discern what is a legitimate authentic project of the self, which is not induced by the demands of ones society, is infinitely difficult.  Indeed, it is not a possibility for Merleau-Ponty and because of its overtones of an unattainable individualism, he refused to use the existential concept of authenticity for his entire career.  But he would not want to say that something like, but slightly different from authenticity (that is, an individual coming to terms with their own situation in an empowering way), is an impossibility.  In many ways, this is a primary ethical demand of his.  Finally however, this ambiguity at the heart of our experience will always be there and an authentic path is not one that we consciously choose by attempting to ensure that we are the only origin of our projects, somehow attempting what he contends is impossible; that is, the transcending of our environment.  Rather, Merleau-Pontys suggestion is that circumstances point us to, and in fact, allow us to find a way (PP 456).  The human situation is both a product of the 'mind and our socio-historical situation, and moral achievement is a tenuous embrace of these facts.  3.  Later Philosophy Merleau-Ponty died before he had the opportunity to complete The Visible and the Invisible, which was intended to be a text of some considerable proportions.  He left us with three reasonably complete chapters, as well as his \"Working Notes\" for the remainder of this book, and from these two sources it is apparent that his thought had undergone some transformations.  However, opinions vary widely as to the extent of these changes.  Indeed, it is worth recalling that in an essay that was unpublished in his own lifetime, Merleau-Ponty describes his philosophical career as falling into two distinct phases: he tells us that the first phase of his work - up to and including the Phenomenology of Perception - involved an attempt to restore the world of perception and to affirm the primacy of the pre-reflective cogito.  In other words, in this period of his work he was intent on emphasizing an inherence in the world that is more fundamental than our thinking/reflective capacities.  The second distinct phase of his work, which refers predominantly to The Visible and the Invisible as well as to the abandoned Prose of the World, is characterized as an attempt \"to show how communication with others, and thought, take up and go beyond the realm of perception\" (EW 367-8).  This is important for several reasons, not least that it suggests a fairly major change in direction.  The idea that communication with others goes beyond the realm of perception, is sufficiently radical to put him at odds with at least a certain definition of phenomenology.  Ostensibly in opposition to this type of characterisation, Martin Dillons book Merleau-Pontys Ontology has emphasized that these two periods of Merleau-Pontys career are actually intimately connected.  Dillon downplays the significance of quotes from Merleau-Ponty like that which has just been cited, and instead insists that The Visible and the Invisible is primarily concerned with bringing the results of the earlier work, which are often primarily psychological, to their ontological explication.  Merleau-Ponty has also suggested similar things at times (cf VI 176), and according to this type of account, the ontology of his later philosophy was already implied in his earlier works.  Despite agreeing with the broad outlines of this position, there are nevertheless some problems with such a characterization that suggest that the truth of this dispute might lie somewhere between these respective accounts.  The more radical aspects of The Visible and the Invisible are ignored by the view that conflates these two major periods, and Merleau-Pontys treatment of Sartres work in his two main texts (VI and PP) also seems to be importantly different.  It is however, more for exegetical than philosophical reasons that I have separated out Merleau-Pontys thought into two major periods.  a.  The Critique of the Phenomenology of Perception Before we begin to examine his final attempt to circumvent the subject-object dichotomy, it is first necessary to get some idea as to why Merleau-Ponty thought his philosophy had to change.  Basically his main criticism of the Phenomenology of Perception is that it remains confined within a philosophy of consciousness, or a philosophy of mind paradigm.  He thinks that to a certain extent the Phenomenology of Perception remains Cartesian, in that it starts from the position of the reflecting philosopher in his or her ivory tower.  Merleau-Ponty suggests that this starting point presupposes a subject doing the reflection, and it hence has an element of humanism about it.  More importantly however, he suggests that this starting point also means that the problems he raises are largely insoluble, as he never quite gets away from a subject/object dichotomy.  If it is unclear what all of these references to a subject-object dichotomy mean, I am simply pointing out the tendency in Western philosophy to posit that which is seen within the field of vision as an object, whereas that which looks, or does the perceiving, is the subject.  Various versions of this type of thought have recurred throughout the tradition, and this partly explains the tendency that we have to think in terms of things in the world (for example, empirical objects or facts), and the human capacity to reflect upon these brute things of the world, and hence transcend them.  We generally maintain a very distinct difference between ourselves and the objects of the world - say the seat upon which we sit - and it might be suggested that we are free, and they are determined, for instance.  Or even if one does not want to assert that human activity is predominantly reflective (and usually this amounts to saying that it is free), philosophers and most of us generally, think in terms of the difference between the empirical fact of what we did, and our reason which transcends this behavior.  This object/consciousness distinction is a dualism.  In The Visible and the Invisible, Merleau-Ponty suggests that the Phenomenology of Perception was ultimately unsuccessful in getting beyond this dualistic way of thinking.  Of course, there is little doubt that Merleau-Ponty is a little bit harsh in regards to his retrospective accounts of his earlier philosophy, and is also simplifying matters if he wants us to believe that the Phenomenology of Perception doesnt significantly problematize this subject-object dichotomy, and any of philosophies other traditional dualisms.  What is clear however, is that The Visible and the Invisible does attempt to effect a transition from something like a phenomenology of consciousness (which is basically just an analysis of how the objects we perceive present themselves to us), to a philosophy of Being.  Being is another of those words in philosophy that is frequently thrown around, but perhaps relatively rarely understood.  This is partly because it is not something that we can pin down or define, because it exceeds all of our resources for attempting to describe it.  Let us suggest, hesitatingly, that Being is that which allows existence to be possible at all, and Merleau-Ponty becomes increasingly concerned with such matters.  This move away from a subject-based philosophy also has some important consequences for the type of philosophy that he was interested in writing.  No longer is his work so strictly an analysis of phenomenological subjectivity, and this means that in some ways The Visible and the Invisible is a little harder to get into than his earlier work.  It is not existential in the sense that the Phenomenology of Perception is.  This earlier text is typified by numerous phenomenological descriptions of our everyday activity and the situations that confront us, and his later work is more concerned with ontological matters.  Ontology just means the study of Being, of that which allows things to be at all, and it is this type of terrain that Merleau-Ponty moves into.  One could even suggest that The Visible and the Invisible gives the results of the Phenomenology of Perception their ontological significance.  In that sense, the subject influenced, and often psychological thinking of his earlier work, would be revealed as also presupposing an account of the structure of Being, which only later came to be elaborated.  It is apparent however, that his thought his changed to the extent that the notion of subjectivity, and its controlling place, is further diminished.  References to the body-subject are also conspicuously absent in his later philosophy, and he seems to have decided that such terminology is inadequate.  The consequences of this move away from a subjective orientation will become more apparent when we consider his ontology later in this essay.  Merleau-Ponty also makes one other important comment about the Phenomenology of Perception, and his reasons for writing a new ontology, which is worth exploring.  According to him, a major factor behind him setting out upon this different path, was the conviction that the tacit or pre-reflective cogito of his earlier philosophy is problematic (VI 179).  The pre-reflective cogito is basically just the idea that there is a cogito before language, or to put it crudely, that there is a self anterior to both language and thought that we can aim to get in closer contact with.  The notion of a pre-reflective cogito hence presumes the possibility of a consciousness without language, and it exhibits something of a nostalgic desire to return to some brute, primordial experience.  This is something that thinkers like Irigiray have criticized Merleau-Ponty for, and in The Visible and the Invisible he has come to share these type of concerns.  In his own words, he suggests that while this concept of the pre-reflective, or tacit cogito, can make understood how language is not impossible, it nevertheless cannot make understood how it is possible (VI 179).  While a logician might grimace at such a suggestion, Merleau-Ponty is certainly aware of this paradox, and seeks to explicate the problems that he associates with this concept of the tacit cogito.  He suggests that like all other philosophies of consciousness, his notion of the pre-reflective cogito depends upon the illusion of non-linguistic signification and The Visible and The Invisible attempts to call into question the very coherence of such a concept.  As he states in one of his \"Working Notes\": \"What I call the tacit cogito is impossible.  To have the idea of thinking (in the sense of thought of seeing and thought of feeling), to make the phenomenological reduction to the things themselves, to return to immanence and to consciousness, it is necessary to have words.  It is by the combination of words that I form the transcendental attitude\" (VI 171).  He later goes on to speak of the \"mythology of self-consciousness to which the word consciousness refers\", and contends that \"there are only differences between significations\" and language (VI 171).  According to Merleau-Ponty, the tacit cogito is therefore a product of language, and the language of the philosopher, in particular.  He continues to speak of a world of silence, but the concept of the pre-reflective cogito imports the language of the philosophy of consciousness into the equation, and hence misrepresents the relationship between vision and speech.  The famous phenomenological reduction to the things themselves, which tries to bracket out the outside world, is hence envisaged as a misplaced nostalgia rather than as a real possibility.  There is a sense in which Merleau-Pontys giving up on the pre-reflective cogito also entails something like a giving up on phenomenology, despite the fact that embodiment is still a major factor in The Visible and the Invisible.  By way of clarification, it is worth noting that he still thinks that an analysis of the body is one of the best ways to avoid the subject-object dichotomy that he argues is typical of most philosophical thought.  At the same time however, his abandonment of the idea of a pre-reflective cogito, or consciousness before linguistic significance, at the very least serves to radicalize phenomenology.  It also means that language comes to play a far more important role in his philosophy than it previously had.  Indeed, Merleau-Ponty used both linguistics, and the language-based emphasis of structuralism to critique Sartre, among other of his contemporaries, who only accorded language a minimal role in their philosophies.  He was also friends with, and used the work of people like Jacques Lacan (a psychoanalyst who suggested that the unconscious is structured like a language), Claude Levi-Strauss (a structuralist anthropologist who dedicated his major work The Savage Mind to the memory of Merleau-Ponty), and also Ferdinand De Saussure (a linguist who showed what a pivotal role differences play in language, and whose work has inspired many recent philosophers including Derrida).  Merleau-Ponty was hence very much involved in what is termed the linguistic turn, and one curious aspect of Merleau-Pontys place within the philosophical tradition is that despite the enduring attention he accords to the problem of language, the work of thinkers such as those cited above, and others who have been inspired by them (Derrida and Foucault for example), has been used to criticize him.  In an important way, he paradoxically laid the groundwork for his own denigration and unfashionability in French intellectual circles, and it is only in the last 15 years that it has been realized that his phenomenology took very seriously the claims of such thinkers, and even pre-empted some aspects of what has come to be termed 'postmodern thought.  Levi-Strauss actually finds The Visible and the Invisible to be a synthesis of structuralism with phenomenology, and he is not alone in this regard.  b.  The Chiasm/Reversibility Rather than maintaining a traditional dualism in which mind and body, subject and object, self and other, and so forth, are discrete and separate entities, in The Visible and the Invisible Merleau-Ponty argues that there is an important sense in which such pairs are also associated.  For example, he does not dispute that there is a divergence, or dehiscence, in our embodied situation that is evident in the difference that exists between touching and being touched, between looking and being looked at, or between the sentient and the sensible in his own vocabulary.  On the contrary, this divergence is considered to be a necessary and constitutive factor in allowing subjectivity to be possible at all.  However, he suggests that rather than involving a simple dualism, this divergence between touching and being touched, or between the sentient and the sensible, also allows for the possibility of overlapping and encroachment between these two terms.  For example, Merleau-Ponty has somewhat famously suggested that the experience of touching cannot be understood without reference to the tacit potential for this situation to be reversed.  As Thomas Busch points out, The Visible and the Invisible highlights that \"in the bodys touching of itself is found a differentiation and an encroachment which is neither sheer identity nor non-identity\" (MPHP 110).  To substantiate this claim in adequate detail would take us too far afield of this essays main concerns, but it is important to recognize that Merleau-Pontys initial, and I think permissible presumption, is that we can never simultaneously touch our right hand while it is also touching an object of the world.  He suggests that \"either my right hand really passes over into the rank of the touched, but then its hold on the world is interrupted, or it retains its hold on the world, but then I do not really touch it\" (VI 148).  There is then, a gap (or ecart in French) between ourselves as touching and ourselves as touched, a divergence between the sentient and sensible aspects of our existence, but this gap is importantly distinct from merely reinstating yet another dualism.  Touching and touched are not simply separate orders of being in the world, since they are reversible, and this image of our left hand touching our right hand does more than merely represent the bodys capacity to be both perceiving object and subject of perception in a constant oscillation (as is arguably the case in Sartres looked at, looked upon, dichotomy, as well as the master-slave oscillations that such a conception induces).  As Merleau-Ponty suggests: \"I can identify the hand touched in the same one which will in a moment be touching. . .  In this bundle of bones and muscles which my right hand presents to my left, I can anticipate for an instant the incarnation of that other right hand, alive and mobile, which I thrust towards things in order to explore them.  The body tries. . .  to touch itself while being touched and initiates a kind of reversible reflection\" (PP 93).  This suggests that the hand that we touch, while it is touching an inanimate object, is hence not merely another such 'object, but another fleshy substance that is capable of reversing the present situation and being mobile and even aggressive.  Given that we cannot touch ourselves, or even somebody else, without this recognition of our own tangibility and capacity to be touched by others, it seems that the awareness of what it feels like to be touched encroaches, or even supervenes upon the experience of touching (VI 147).  Any absolute distinction between being in the world as touching, and being in the world as touched, deprives the existential phenomena of their true complexity.  Our embodied subjectivity is never located purely in either our tangibility or in our touching, but in the intertwining of these two aspects, or where the two lines of a chiasm intersect with one another.  The chiasm then, is simply an image to describe how this overlapping and encroachment can take place between a pair that nevertheless retains a divergence, in that touching and touched are obviously never exactly the same thing.  According to Merleau-Ponty, these observations also retain an applicability that extends well beyond the relationship that obtains between touching and being touched.  He contends that mind and body (VI 247, 259), the perceptual faith and its articulation (VI 93), subject and object, self and world (VI 123), as well as many other related dualisms, are all associated chiasmically, and he terms this interdependence of these various different notions the flesh (VI 248-51).  The rather radical consequences of this intertwining become most obvious when Merleau-Ponty sets about describing the interactions of this embodied flesh.  At one stage in The Visible and the Invisible he suggests that the realization that the world is not simply an object: \"does not mean that there was a fusion or coinciding of me with it: on the contrary, this occurs because a sort of dehiscence opens my body in two, and because between my body looked at and my body looking, my body touched and my body touching, there is overlapping or encroachment, so that we may say that the things pass into us, as well as we into the things\" (VI 123).  According to Merleau-Ponty then, this non-dualistic divergence between touching and being touched, which necessitates some form of encroachment between the two terms, also means that the world is capable of encroaching upon and altering us, just as we are capable of altering it.  Such an ontology rejects any absolute antinomy between self and world, as well as any notion of subjectivity that prioritizes a rational, autonomous individual, who is capable of imposing their choice upon a situation that is entirely external to them.  To put the problem in Sartrean terms, while it may sometimes prove efficacious to distinguish between transcendence and facticity [a technical term of Martin Heideggers that in Merleau-Pontys usage refers to the sum of brute \"facts\" about us, including our social situation and our physical attributes, abilities and circumstances], or Being-for-itself and Being-in-itself, Merleau-Ponty thinks that such notions also overlap in such a way as to undermine any absolute difference between these two terms.  As a consequence, Sartres conception of an absolute freedom in regards to a situation is also rendered untenable by the recognition of the ways in which self and world are chiasmically intertwined, though this is not to suggest that the world can be reduced to us.  Indeed, Merleau-Ponty explicitly asserts that precisely what is rarely considered is this paradoxical fact that though we are of the world, we are nevertheless not the world (VI 127), and in affirming the interdependence of humanity and the 'things of the world in a way that permits neither fusion nor absolute distance, he advocates an embodied inherence of a different type.  c.  The Other Given that he rarely makes any distinction between the structure of our relations with others and the structure of our relations with the world, his descriptions also pertain directly to the problem of the other, which has come to be accorded of lot of attention in recent times under the auspices of what is frequently termed alterity.  Merleau-Pontys chiasmic ontology ensures that in some sense the other is always already intertwined within the subject, and he explicitly suggests that self and non-self are but the obverse and reverse of each other (VI 83, 160).  If I can present his position a little schematically, basically his later philosophy attempts to reinforce that self and other are also relationally constituted via their potential reversibility.  One example of this might be the way in which looking at another person - or even a painter looking at trees, according to one of Merleau-Pontys more enigmatic examples - always also involves the tacit recognition that we too can be looked at.  However, rather than simply oscillating between these two modes of being - looker and looked upon, as Sartrean philosophy would have it - for Merleau-Ponty each experience is betrothed to the other in such a way that we are never simply a disembodied looker, or a transcendental consciousness.  Rather, the alterity of the others look is always already involved in us, and rather than unduly exalting alterity by positing it as forever elusive, or as recognizable only as freedom that transcends my freedom, he instead affirms an interdependence of self and other that involves these categories overlapping and intertwining with one another, but without ever being reduced to each other.  One consequence of Merleau-Pontys position is that questions regarding the otherness of the other are rendered something of an abstraction, at least if they attempt to conceive of that other without reference to the subjectivity with which it is always chiasmically intertwined.  As Dorothy Olkowski has suggested, \"if there is to be room in the world for others as others, there must be some connection between self and other that exceeds purely psychic life\" (Olkowski 4), and this is envisaged as an ontological necessity rather than an attempt to propound a thesis that restores us to the primordial affection that we have for the other.  For Merleau-Ponty, a responsible treatment of alterity consists in recognizing that alterity is always already intertwined within subjectivity, rather than by obscuring this fact by projecting a self-present individual who is confronted by an alterity that is essentially inaccessible and beyond comprehension.  Far from merely being a negative thing, the alterity of the other is too complicated to simply be posited as that which will forever elude us, and such a description ignores the important ways in which self and other are partially intertwined.  In The Visible and the Invisible then, there is a tacit claim regarding what a responsible treatment of the alterity of the other consists in, even if Merleau-Ponty rarely considers notions like responsibility in any explicit fashion.  His final ontology wants to insist that alterity is something that can only be appreciated in being encountered, and in a recognition of the fact that there can be no absolute alterity.  If absolute alterity is but a synonym of death, and inconceivable to humanity, then what needs to be considered, according to Merleau-Ponty, is the paradoxical way in which self and other are intertwined, and yet also, and at the same time, divergent.  Indeed, Merleau-Ponty is also careful not to fall prey to what has been termed, sometimes disparagingly, the horizonality of phenomenology.  He devotes an entire chapter titled \"Interrogation and Intuition\" to distancing himself from this tendency of phenomenology - which he traces to Hegel, Husserl and Bergson - to subsume all else under the concept of context and background.  Engendering a coincidence between self and world (or self and other), is just as antithetical to his philosophical purposes as advocating a vast abyssal difference, and Merleau-Ponty asserts that when we are overly sure of the other, just as when we are overly unsure of the other, an inadequate apprehension of human relations beckons.  For Merleau-Ponty, alterity is that which cannot be reduced to the logic of an either/or, as he doesnt want to espouse a Sartrean version of human relations where the other can never really be understood, and yet nor does his philosophy reductively ignore this alterity.  He suggests that: \"this infinite distance, this absolute proximity express in two ways - as a soaring over or as fusion - the same relationship with the thing itself.  They are two positivisms. . . \" (VI 127), indeed, neither of which he wants to associate with his new ontology.  In an attempt to avoid this dualistic tendency to conceive of the other as either beyond the comprehension of a subject, or as domesticated by the subject and their horizons of significance, The Visible and the Invisible emphasizes that the other is always already encroaching upon us, though they are not reducible to us, and for Merleau-Ponty, the risk of this overlapping with the other can and should always be there (VI 123).  His philosophy consistently alludes to the manner in which this encroachment is not simply a bad thing.  For Merleau-Ponty, interacting with and influencing the other (even contributing to permanently changing them), does not necessarily constitute a denial of their alterity.  On the contrary, if done properly it in fact attests to it, because we are open to the possibility of being influenced and changed by the difference that they bring to bear upon our interaction with them.  This is the ethics that his ontology of the flesh tacitly presupposes, and it is a position that is importantly different from those proposed by more recent philosophers, including Sartre, Levinas and Derrida respectively.  Before themes like the death of philosophy, and the non-space of philosophy began to dominate the philosophical landscape, Merleau-Ponty had already begun to articulate a similar problem, though arguably without sharing quite the same nihilistic consequences that some more recent proponents of a similar position have found themselves implicated in.  Harboring a deep distrust of the philosophy of reflection, Merleau-Ponty sought to ensure that reflection was not unduly exalted in the Phenomenology of Perception, and The Visible and the Invisible reaffirms this contention, albeit in slightly different terms, through his espoused methodology of \"hyper-reflection,\" which is also synonymously referred to as a \"hyper-dialectic. \" There are several aspects of this notion that require delineation, but the most obvious of these pertains to the role of philosophy, and precisely what he thinks it can accomplish.  At one stage in The Visible and the Invisible, Merleau-Ponty rather controversially claims that in the philosophers descriptions of the sensible world, \"there is no longer identity between the lived experience and the principle of non-contradiction\" (VI 87).  Merleau-Pontys apparent disavowal of the law of non-contradiction requires further consideration, as it challenges one of the most fundamental principles of Western philosophy since Aristotle.  In explaining his rejection of this principle, he suggests that: \"The situation of the philosopher who speaks as distinct from what he speaks of, insofar as that situation affects what he says with a certain latent content which is not its manifest content. . .  implies a divergence between the essences he fixes and the lived experience to which they are applied, between the operation of living the world and the entities and negentities in which he expresses it\" (VI 87).  For Merleau-Ponty then, lived experience may partake in contradiction on account of a residue of this difference between the act of speaking and what is spoken of, as well as a correlative divergence between a latent content and a manifest content.  This divergence that he theorizes hints at a predicament that seems closely related to what Jacques Derrida has more recently insisted upon in his strategy of deconstruction, in that both philosophers point towards the inevitability of a philosophical expression containing contrary elements within it.  While Derrida has also implicitly entertained the possibility that the law of non-contradiction might be false, in suggesting that their may instead be a law of impurity or \"a principle of contamination\", it is important to ascertain that their are some surprising similarities between Merleau-Ponty and Derridas descriptions of the necessarily double nature of a philosophy that can never recapture the pre-reflective faith, or coincide with itself in a moment of self-presence.  This strange proximity between deconstruction and Merleau-Pontys own methodology cannot be explored in any detail in this essay, but Jean-Francois Lyotard and Rodolphe Gasche are two important 'continental thinkers to have recognized the manner in which Merleau-Pontys notion of a hyper-reflection pre-empted aspects of deconstruction.  Of course, unlike Derrida, Merleau-Pontys critique of reflection, and his subsequent call for a hyper-reflection, quite obviously locates itself primarily in an analysis of the body where he discerns a necessary and constitutive divergence within the embodied situation.  As we have seen, this ecart is variously described as the difference between the sentient and the sensible, the tangible and the touched, and for Merleau-Ponty, it also applies to several other divergences, including one between the perceptual faith and its articulation (VI 87).  Once again, this concept is most easily demonstrated through an example that we have previously contemplated - that is, an individuals left hand touching their right hand, while their right hand is also simultaneously touching another object.  Of this situation, Merleau-Ponty suggests that: \"If my left hand is touching my right hand, and if I wish to suddenly apprehend with my right hand the work of my left hand as it touches, this reflection of the body upon itself always miscarries at the last moment: the moment I feel my left hand with my right hand, I correspondingly cease touching my right hand with my left hand\" (VI 9, cf to PP 108).  According to Merleau-Ponty, there is hence a fundamental divergence within the body, but just as this gap ensures the impossibility of any thorough and all-encompassing self-perception, it is also that which allows perception, and indeed subjectivity, to be possible at all.  It is important to ascertain that if our embodied divergence inaugurates our capacity for perception (as well as language and reflection), this same divergence also ensures that there are certain limits upon this capacity.  Just as we cannot reflexively attain to a self-identity with the hand that we are touching, for Merleau-Ponty the philosophy of reflection cannot entirely overcome similar divergences (VI 38).  In his critique of Hegel, Sartre and others, Merleau-Ponty insists that \"reflection recuperates everything except itself as an effort of recuperation, it clarifies everything except its own role\" (VI 33).  There is a temporal divergence that precludes the attempted recovery of meaning via reflection from coinciding with that which it attempts to demarcate.  The task of hyper-reflection then, is to ensure that reflection is always aware of its own finitude.  It is hence somewhat removed from philosophical reflection itself, and resides in what several theorists have referred to as the non-space of philosophy.  The proximity of such sentiments to Derrida has been widely recognized (and also occasionally contested), but what is irrefutable is that Merleau-Ponty is concerned with the tendency of the metaphysical tradition to exalt self-presence, as well as the rationalism that this usually entails.  While traditional reflective thought is inevitable and indeed indispensable, the idea of philosophy being able to mirror or transcend nature is disparaged (VI 99).  Philosophy and other reflective pursuits cannot recuperate the pre-reflective faith or rediscover some pure immediacy (VI 35, 99).  On the contrary, he claims that: \"What we propose here, and oppose to the search for the essence, is not the return to the immediate, the coincidence, the effective fusion with the existent, the search for an original integrity, for a secret lost and to be rediscovered, which would nullify our questions and even reprehend language.  If coincidence is lost, this is no accident; if Being is hidden, this is itself a characteristic of Being and no disclosure will make us comprehend it\" (VI 121-2).  Of course, this is a rather negative characterization of what hyper-reflection involves, and it is worth digressing to consider more precisely what it is that Merleau-Ponty wants his philosophy to achieve.  According to him: \"What we call hyper-dialectic is a thought that, on the contrary, is capable of reaching truth because it envisages without restriction the plurality of the relationships and what has been called ambiguity.  The bad dialectic is that which thinks it recomposes being by a thetic thought, by an assemblage of statements, by thesis, antithesis, and synthesis; the good dialectic is that which is conscious of the fact that every thesis is an idealization, that Being is not made up of idealizations or of things said. . .  but of bound wholes where signification never is except in tendency\" (VI 94).  While this passage reaffirms the enduring role of ambiguity in his philosophy, Merleau-Pontys hyper-dialectic is also described as acknowledging that not only is every thesis an idealisation, but that Being cannot be ascertained through such idealisations.  He also goes on to suggest that such a dialectical thought: \"Abounds in the sensible world, but on condition that the sensible world has been divested of all that the ontologies have added to it.  One of the tasks of the dialectic, as a situational thought, a thought in contact with being, is to shake off the false evidences, to denounce the significations cut off from the experience of being, emptied - and to criticize itself in the measure that it itself becomes one of them\" (VI 92).  Merleau-Pontys hyper-dialectic is envisaged as being a situational thought that must criticize all thinking that ignores the conditional nature of idealizations, and it must also maintain a vigilance to ensure that it does not itself become one of them.  This is why Merleau-Ponty describes his project as propounding an 'indirect ontology, rather than a direct ontology (VI 179).  Undoubtedly these themes are deserving of more prolonged attention, but there seems to be a significant and underestimated connection between what Merleau-Pontys hyper-reflection seeks to achieve, and what Derridas deconstructive methodology has more recently attempted.  Without digressing unduly in this regard, his work retains a relevance to contemporary European philosophy, and not least because many theorists are convinced that he is a valuable resource who doesnt quite succumb to the excesses of his successors on the French scene.  4.

Also well known, and equally perplexing at a superficial level, is his insistence that his doctrine is no more than what is consistent with common sense.  It was every bit as crucial for Berkeley that it be demonstrated that the colors are really in the tulip, as that there is nothing that is neither a mind nor something perceived by a mind.  ( . . .  ) In what follows, I shall attempt to re-examine Berkeley's argument in terms of what it appears to have meant to him.  I am especially interested in the connection between Berkeley's thought concerning the relation between perception and metaphysics and that of Maurice Merleau-Ponty, with whom, perhaps surprisingly, Berkeley shared a great many intuitions and concerns.  Thus part of my objective is to compare and contrast the work of two thinkers who had many common interests, and whose thought frequently led them down similar paths.  I shall be especially interested in apparent points of departure, both those that turn out to reflect real divergences and those which reflect confusions of one kind or another.  My main objective, however, is not mere textual analysis.  Like both Berkeley and Merleau-Ponty, my main hope is to make progress in clarifying how things are.  As odd as some of Berkeley's pronouncements may sound to contemporary ears - concerning especially the metaphysical consequences of what he regarded as perceptual facts - I shall argue that, in substance, he was often not far wrong at all - at least as measured by important strands of more contemporary work on the subject.  More particularly, I shall contend that for going a long way down an extraordinarily fruitful path which has been subsequently explored more fully by (especially) Martin Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, Nelson Goodman and Hilary Putnam, Berkeley deserves considerably more credit than he is usually accorded as a progenitor of contemporary approaches to metaphysical issues.  ( shrink )", "article_4": "First published Wed Sep 14, 2016 Merleau-Pontys thought has continued to inspire contemporary research beyond the usual intellectual history and interpretive scholarship, especially in the areas of feminist philosophy, philosophy of mind and cognitive science, environmental philosophy and philosophy of nature, political philosophy, philosophy of art, philosophy of language, and phenomenological ontology.  His work has also been widely influential on researchers outside the discipline of philosophy proper, especially in anthropology, architecture, the arts, cognitive science, environmental theory, film studies, linguistics, literature, and political theory.  For most of his career, Merleau-Ponty focused on the problems of perception and embodiment as a starting point for clarifying the relation between the mind and the body, the objective world and the experienced world, expression in language and art, history, politics, and nature.  Although phenomenology provided the overarching framework for these investigations, Merleau-Ponty also drew freely on empirical research in psychology and ethology, anthropology, psychoanalysis, linguistics, and the arts.  His constant points of historical reference are Descartes, Kant, Hegel, and Marx.  The characteristic approach of Merleau-Pontys theoretical work is his effort to identify an alternative to intellectualism or idealism, on the one hand, and empiricism or realism, on the other, by critiquing their common presupposition of a ready-made world and failure to account for the historical and embodied character of experience.  In his later writings, Merleau-Ponty becomes increasingly critical of the intellectualist tendencies of the phenomenological method as well, although with the intention of reforming rather than abandoning it.  The posthumous writings collected in The Visible and the Invisible aim to clarify the ontological implications of a phenomenology that would self-critically account for its own limitations.  This leads him to propose concepts such as \"flesh\" and \"chiasm\" that many consider to be his most fruitful philosophical contributions.  Maurice Jean Jacques Merleau-Ponty (1908-1961), French philosopher and public intellectual, was the leading academic proponent of existentialism and phenomenology in post-war France.  Best known for his original and influential work on embodiment, perception, and ontology, he also made important contributions to the philosophy of art, history, language, nature, and politics.  Associated in his early years with the existentialist movement through his friendship with Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir, Merleau-Ponty played a central role in the dissemination of phenomenology, which he sought to integrate with Gestalt psychology, psychoanalysis, Marxism, and Saussurian linguistics.  Major influences on his thinking include Henri Bergson, Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, Max Scheler, and Jean-Paul Sartre, as well as neurologist Kurt Goldstein, Gestalt theorists such as Wolfgang Kohler and Kurt Koffka, and literary figures including Marcel Proust, Paul Claudel, and Paul Valery.  In turn, he influenced the post-structuralist generation of French thinkers who succeeded him, including Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze, and Jacques Derrida, whose similarities with and debt to the later Merleau-Ponty have often been underestimated.  Merleau-Ponty published two major theoretical texts during his lifetime: The Structure of Behavior (1942 SC) and Phenomenology of Perception (1945 PP).  Other important publications include two volumes of political philosophy, Humanism and Terror (1947 HT) and Adventures of the Dialectic (1955 AdD), as well as two books of collected essays on art, philosophy, and politics: Sense and Non-Sense (1996b/1964) and Signs (1960/1964).  Two unfinished manuscripts appeared posthumously: The Prose of the World (1969/1973), drafted in 1950-51; and The Visible and the Invisible (1964 V&I), on which he was working at the time of his death.  Lecture notes and student transcriptions of many of his courses at the Sorbonne and the College de France have also been published.  1.  Life and Works Merleau-Ponty was born in Rochefort-sur-Mer, in the province of Charente-Maritime, on March 14, 1908. After the death in 1913 of his father, a colonial artillery captain and a knight of the Legion of Honor, he moved with his family to Paris.  He would later describe his childhood as incomparably happy, and he remained very close to his mother until her death in 1953.  Merleau-Ponty pursued secondary studies at the Parisian lycees Janson-de-Sailly and Louis-le-Grand, completing his first course in philosophy at Janson-de-Sailly with Gustave Rodrigues in 1923-24.  He won the schools \"Award for Outstanding Achievement\" in philosophy that year and would later trace his commitment to the vocation of philosophy to this first course.  He was also awarded \"First Prize in Philosophy\" at Louis-le-Grand in 1924-25.  He attended the Ecole Normale Superieure from 1926 to 1930, where he befriended Simone de Beauvoir and Claude Levi-Straus.  Some evidence suggests that, during these years, Merleau-Ponty authored a novel, Nord.  Recit de larctique, under the pseudonym Jacques Heller (Alloa 2013b).  His professors at ENS included Leon Brunschvicg and Emile Brehier, the latter supervising his research on Plotinus for the Diplome detudes superieures in 1929.  Brehier would continue to supervise Merleau-Pontys research through the completion of his two doctoral dissertations in 1945.  During his student years, Merleau-Ponty attended Husserls 1929 Sorbonne lectures and Georges Gurvitchs 1928-1930 courses on German philosophy.  He received the agregation in philosophy in 1930, ranking in second place.  After a year of mandatory military service, Merleau-Ponty taught at the lycee in Beauvais from 1931 to 1933, pursued a year of research on perception funded by a subvention from the Caisse nationale des sciences (the precursor of todays Centre national de la recherche scientifique) in 1933-34, and taught at the lycee in Chartres in 1934-35.  From 1935 to 1940, he was a tutor (agege-repetiteur) at the Ecole Normale Superieure, where his primary duty was to prepare students for the agregation.  During this period, he attended Alexandre Kojeves lectures on Hegel and Aron Gurwitschs lectures on Gestalt psychology.  His first publications also appeared during these years, as a series of review essays on Max Schelers Ressentiment (1935), Gabriel Marcels Being and Having (1936), and Sartres Imagination (1936). In 1938, he completed his these complementaire, originally titled Conscience et comportement [Consciousness and Behavior] and published in 1942 as La structure du comportement [The Structure of Behavior, SC].  He was the first outside visitor to the newly established Husserl Archives in Louvain, Belgium, in April 1939, where he met Eugen Fink and consulted Husserls unpublished manuscripts, including Ideen II and later sections of Die Krisis.  With the outbreak of World War Two, Merleau-Ponty served for a year as lieutenant in the 5th Infantry Regiment and 59th Light Infantry Division, until he was wounded in battle in June 1940, days before the signing of the armistice between France and Germany.  He was awarded the Croix de guerre, recognizing bravery in combat.  After several months of convalescence, he returned to teaching at the Lycee Carnot in Paris, where he remained from 1940 until 1944.  In November 1940, he married Suzanne Jolibois, and their daughter Marianne was born in June 1941.  In the winter of 1940-41, Merleau-Ponty renewed his acquaintance with Jean-Paul Sartre, whom he had met as a student at the Ecole Normale, through their involvement in the resistance group Socialisme et Liberte.  The group published around ten issues of an underground review until the arrest of two members in early 1942 led to its dissolution.  After the conclusion of the war, in 1945, Merleau-Ponty would collaborate with Sartre and Beauvoir to found Les Temps Modernes, a journal devoted to \"litterature engagee\", for which he served as political editor until 1952.  At the end of the 1943-44 school year, Merleau-Ponty completed his main thesis, Phenomenologie de la perception [Phenomenology of Perception, PP], and in 1944-45 he taught at the Lycee Condorcet in Paris, replacing Sartre during the latters leave from this position.  Merleau-Ponty defended his two dissertations in July 1945, fulfilling the requirements for the Docteur es lettres, which was awarded \"with distinction\".  In October 1945, Les Temps Modernes published its inaugural issue; Merleau-Ponty was a founding member of the journals governing board, managed its daily affairs, and penned many of its editorials that were signed simply \"T. M. \", even though he refused to allow his name to be printed on the cover alongside Sartres as the reviews Director.  That fall, Merleau-Ponty was appointed to the post of Maitre de conferences in Psychology at the University of Lyon, where he was promoted to the rank of Professor in the Chair of Psychology in 1948.  From 1947 to 1949, he also taught supplementary courses at the Ecole Normale Superieure, where his students included the young Michel Foucault.  Student notes (taken by Jean Deprun) from Merleau-Pontys 1947-48 course on \"The Union of the Soul and the Body in Malebranche, Biran, and Bergson\"--a course that he taught at both Lyon and E. N. S.  to prepare students for the agregation and which was attended by Foucault--were published in 1968 (1997b/2001).  In 1947, Merleau-Ponty participated regularly in the College philosophique, an association formed by Jean Wahl to provide an open venue for intellectual exchange without the academic formality of the Sorbonne, and frequented by many leading Parisian thinkers.  Merleau-Ponty published his first book of political philosophy in 1947, Humanisme et terreur, essai sur le probleme communiste [Humanism and Terror: An Essay on the Communist Problem, 1969, HT], in which he responded to the developing opposition between liberal democracies and communism by cautioning a \"wait-and-see\" attitude toward Marxism.  A collection of essays concerning the arts, philosophy, and politics, Sens et non-sense [Sense and Non-Sense, 1996b/1964], appeared in 1948.  In the fall of 1948, Merleau-Ponty delivered a series of seven weekly lectures on French national radio that were subsequently published as Causeries 1948 (2002/2004).  Merleau-Ponty declined an invitation to join the Department of Philosophy at the University of Chicago as a Visiting Professor in 1948-49, but instead received a leave from Lyon for the year to present a series of lectures at the University of Mexico in early 1949.  Later in 1949, Merleau-Ponty was appointed Professor of Child Psychology and Pedagogy at the University of Paris, and in this position lectured widely on child development, psychoanalysis, phenomenology, Gestalt psychology, and anthropology.  His eight courses from the Sorbonne are known from compiled student notes reviewed by him and published in the Sorbonnes Bulletin de psychologie (1988/2010).  Merleau-Ponty held this position for three years until his election, in 1952, to the Chair of Philosophy at the College de France, the most prestigious post for a philosopher in France, which he would hold until his death in 1961.  At forty-four, Merleau-Ponty was the youngest person ever elected to this position, but his appointment was not without controversy.  Rather than following the typical procedure of ratifying the vote of the General Assembly of Professors, who had selected Merleau-Ponty as their lead candidate, the Academie des sciences morales et politiques made the unprecedented decision to remove his name from the list of candidates; the Academies decision was subsequently overturned by the Minister of Education himself, who allowed the faculty vote in favor of Merleau-Ponty to stand.  Merleau-Pontys January 1953 inaugural lecture at the College de France was published under the title Eloge de la Philosophie [In Praise of Philosophy, 1953/1963].  Many of his courses from the College de France have subsequently been published, based either on student notes or Merleau-Pontys own lecture notes (1964b, 1968/1970, 1995/2003, 1996a, 1998/2002, 2003/2010, 2011, 2013).  In the face of growing political disagreements with Sartre set in motion by the Korean War, Merleau-Ponty resigned his role as political editor of Les Temps Modernes in December of 1952 and withdrew from the editorial board altogether in 1953.  His critique of Sartres politics became public in 1955 with Les Aventures de la dialectique [Adventures of the Dialectic, 1973 AdD], in which Merleau-Ponty distanced himself from revolutionary Marxism and sharply criticized Sartre for \"ultrabolshevism\".  Beauvoirs equally biting rebuttal, \"Merleau-Ponty and Pseudo-Sartreanism\", published the same year in Les Temps Modernes, accuses Merleau-Ponty of willfully misrepresenting Sartres position, opening a rift between the three former friends that would never entirely heal.  Merleau-Pontys intellectual circle during his years at the College de France included Levi-Straus and Jacques Lacan, and for several years he was a regular contributor to the popular weekly magazine LExpress.  In October and November 1955, on a commission from Alliance francaise, Merleau-Ponty visited several African countries, including Tunisia, French Equatorial Africa, the Belgian Congo, and Kenya, where he delivered a series of lectures on the concept of race, colonialism, and development.  In 1956, he published Les Philosophes celebres [Famous Philosophers], a large edited volume of original introductions to key historical and contemporary thinkers (beginning, interestingly, with philosophers from India and China) whose contributors included Gilles Deleuze, Gilbert Ryle, Alfred Schutz, and Jean Starobinski.  In April 1957, Merleau-Ponty declined to accept induction into Frances Order of the Legion of Honor, presumably in protest over the inhumane actions of the Fourth Republic, including the use of torture, during the Battle of Algiers.  In October and November of 1957, as his second commission from Alliance francaise, he lectured in Madagascar, Reunion Island, and Mauritius, citing as a primary motivation for accepting the commission his desire to see first-hand the effects of reforms in French policies governing overseas territories.  The last book Merleau-Ponty published during his lifetime, Signes [Signs, 1960/1964], appearing in 1960, collecting essays on art, language, the history of philosophy, and politics that spanned more than a decade.  His last published essay, \"LOEil et lesprit\" [\"Eye and Mind\", 1964a OEE] addressing the ontological implications of painting, appeared in the 1961 inaugural issue of Art de France.  Merleau-Ponty died of a heart attack in Paris on May 3rd, 1961, at the age of 53, with Descartes Optics open on his desk.  Merleau-Pontys friend and former student Claude Lefort published two of his teachers unfinished manuscripts posthumously: La prose du monde [The Prose of the World, 1969/1973], an exploration of literature and expression drafted in 1950-51 and apparently abandoned; and Le visible et linvisible [The Visible and the Invisible, 1968 V&I], a manuscript and numerous working notes from 1959-1961 that present elements of Merleau-Pontys mature ontology.  The latter manuscript was apparently part of a larger project, Etre et Monde [Being and World], for which two additional unpublished sections were substantially drafted in 1957-1958: La Nature ou le monde du silence [Nature or the World of Silence] and Introduction a lontologie [Introduction to Ontology] (Saint Aubert 2013: 28). These manuscripts, along with many of Merleau-Pontys other unpublished notes and papers, were donated to the Bibliotheque Nationale de France by Suzanne Merleau-Ponty in 1992 and are available for consultation by scholars. 2.  The Nature of Perception and The Structure of Behavior Merleau-Pontys lifelong interest in the philosophical status of perception is already reflected in his successful 1933 application for a subvention to study the nature of perception, where he proposes to synthesize recent findings in experimental psychology (especially Gestalt psychology) and neurology to develop an alternative to dominant intellectualist accounts of perception inspired by critical (Kantian) philosophy.  Interestingly, this early proposal emphasizes the significance of the perception of ones own body for distinguishing between the \"universe of perception\" and its intellectual reconstructions, and it gestures toward the \"realist philosophers of England and America\" (presumably William James and A.  N.  Whitehead, as presented in Jean Wahls 1932 Vers le concret) for their insights into the irreducibility of the sensory and the concrete to intellectual relations.  While this initial proposal makes no mention of phenomenology, Merleau-Pontys subsequent 1934 report on the years research, noting the limitations of approaching the philosophical study of perception through empirical research alone, emphasizes the promise of Husserlian phenomenology for providing a distinctively philosophical framework for the investigation of psychology.  In particular, Merleau-Ponty mentions the distinction between the natural and transcendental attitudes and the intentionality of consciousness as valuable for \"revising the very notions of consciousness and sensation\" (NP: 192/78).  He also cites approvingly Aron Gurwitschs claim that Husserls analyses \"lead to the threshold of Gestaltpsychologie\", the second area of focus in this early study.  The Gestalt is \"a spontaneous organization of the sensory field\" in which there are \"only organizations, more or less stable, more or less articulated\" (NP: 193/79).  Merleau-Pontys brief summary of Gestalt psychology, anticipating research presented in his first two books, emphasizes the figure-ground structure of perception, the phenomena of depth and movement, and the syncretic perception of children.  Nevertheless, Merleau-Ponty concludes--again citing Gurwitsch--that the epistemological framework of Gestalt psychology remains Kantian, requiring that one look \"in a very different direction, for a very different solution\" to the problem of the relation between the world described naturalistically and the world as perceived (NP: 198/82).  Merleau-Pontys first book, The Structure of Behavior (SC), resumes the project of synthesizing and reworking the insights of Gestalt theory and phenomenology to propose an original understanding of the relationship between \"consciousness\" and \"nature\".  Whereas the neo-Kantian idealism then dominant in France (e. g. , Leon Brunschvicg, Jules Lachelier) treated nature as an objective unity dependent on the synthetic activity of consciousness, the realism of the natural sciences and empirical psychology assumed nature to be composed of external things and events interacting causally.  Merleau-Ponty argues that neither approach is tenable: organic life and human consciousness are emergent from a natural world that is not reducible to its meaning for a mind; yet this natural world is not the causal nexus of pre-existing objective realities, since it is fundamentally composed of nested Gestalts, spontaneously emerging structures of organization at multiple levels and degrees of integration.  On the one hand, the idealist critique of naturalism should be extended to the naturalistic assumptions framing Gestalt theory.  On the other hand, there is a justified truth in naturalism that limits the idealist universalization of consciousness, and this is discovered when Gestalt structures are recognized to be ontologically basic and the limitations of consciousness are thereby exposed.  The notion of \"behavior\", taken by Merleau-Ponty as parallel to the phenomenological concept of \"experience\" (in explicit contrast with the American school of behaviorism), is a privileged starting point for the analysis thanks to its neutrality with respect to classical distinctions between the \"mental\" and the \"physiological\" (SC: 2/4).  The Structure of Behavior first critiques traditional reflex accounts of the relation between stimulus and reaction in light of the findings of Kurt Goldstein and other contemporary physiologists, arguing that the organism is not passive but imposes its own conditions between the given stimulus and the expected response, so that behavior remains inexplicable in purely anatomical or atomistic terms.  Merleau-Ponty instead describes the nervous system as a \"field of forces\" apportioned according to \"modes of preferred distribution\", a model inspired by Wolfgang Kohlers Gestalt physics (SC: 48/46).  Both physiology and behavior are \"forms\", that is, total processes whose properties are not the sum of those which the isolated parts would possess. . . .  [T]here is form wherever the properties of a system are modified by every change brought about in a single one of its parts and, on the contrary, are conserved when they all change while maintaining the same relationship among themselves.  (SC: 49-50/47) Form or structure therefore describes dialectical, non-linear, and dynamic relationships that can function relatively autonomously and are irreducible to linear mechanical causality (see Thompson 2007).  The critique of physiological atomism is also extended to theories of higher behavior, such as Pavlovs theory of conditioned reflexes.  Merleau-Ponty argues that such accounts rely on gratuitous hypotheses lacking experimental justification and cannot effectively explain brain function or learning.  In the case of brain function, experimental work on brain damage demonstrates that localization hypotheses must be rejected in favor of a global process of neural organization comparable to the figure-ground structures of perceptual organization.  Similarly, learning cannot be explained in terms of trial-and-error fixing of habitual reactions, but instead involves a general aptitude with respect to typical structures of situations.  Merleau-Ponty proposes an alternative tripartite classification of behavior according to the degree to which the structures toward which it is oriented emerge thematically from their content.  Syncretic behaviors, typical of simpler organisms such as ants or toads, respond to all stimuli as analogues of vital situations for which the organisms responses are instinctually prescribed by its \"species a priori\", with no possibility for adaptive learning or improvisation.  Amovable behaviors are oriented toward signals of varying complexity that are not a function of the organisms instinctual equipment and can lead to genuine learning.  Here the organism, guided by its vital norms, responds to signals as relational structures rather than as objective properties of things.  Drawing on Kohlers experimental work with chimpanzees, Merleau-Ponty argues that even intelligent non-human animals lack an orientation toward objective things, which emerges only at the level of symbolic behavior.  While amovable behavior remains attached to immediate functional structures, symbolic behavior (here limited to humans) is open to virtual, expressive, and recursive relationships across structures, making possible the human orientation toward objectivity, truth, creativity, and freedom from biologically determined norms.  More generally, Merleau-Ponty proposes that matter, life, and mind are increasingly integrative levels of Gestalt structure, ontologically continuous but structurally discontinuous, and distinguished by the characteristic properties emergent at each integrative level of complexity.  A form is defined here as a field of forces characterized by a law which has no meaning outside the limits of the dynamic structure considered, and which on the other hand assigns its properties to each internal point so much so that they will never be absolute properties, properties of this point.  (SC: 148/137-38) Merleau-Ponty argues that this understanding extends to all physical laws, which \"express a structure and have meaning only within this structure\"; the laws of physics always refer back to \"a sensible or historical given\" and ultimately to the history of the universe (SC: 149/138, 157/145).  At the level of life, form is characterized by a dialectical relation between the organism and its environment that is a function of the organisms vital norms, its \"optimal conditions of activity and its proper manner of realizing equilibrium\", which express its style or \"general attitude toward the world\" (SC: 161/148).  Living things are not oriented toward an objective world but toward an environment that is organized meaningfully in terms of their individual and specific style and vital goals.  Mind, the symbolic level of form that Merleau-Ponty identifies with the human, is organized not toward vital goals but by the characteristic structures of the human world: tools, language, culture, and so on.  These are not originally encountered as things or ideas, but rather as \"significative intentions\" embodied within the world.  Mind or consciousness cannot be defined formally in terms of self-knowledge or representation, then, but is essentially engaged in the structures and actions of the human world and encompasses all of the diverse intentional orientations of human life.  While mind integrates within itself the subordinate structures of matter and life, it goes beyond these in its thematic orientation toward structures as such, which is the condition for such characteristically human symbolic activities as language and expression, the creation of new structures beyond those set by vital needs, and the power of choosing and varying points of view (which make truth and objectivity possible).  In short, mind as a second-order or recursive structure is oriented toward the virtual rather than simply toward the real.  Ideally, the subordinate structure of life would be fully absorbed into the higher order of mind in a fully integrated human being; the biological would be transcended by the \"spiritual\".  But integration is never perfect or complete, and mind can never be detached from its moorings in a concrete and embodied situation.  Merleau-Ponty emphasizes throughout The Structure of Behavior that form, even though ontologically fundamental, cannot be accounted for in the terms of traditional realism; since form is fundamentally perceptual, an \"immanent signification\", it retains an essential relationship with consciousness.  But the \"perceptual consciousness\" at stake here is not the transcendental consciousness of critical philosophy.  The last chapter of The Structure of Behavior clarifies this revised understanding of consciousness in dialogue with the classical problem of the relation between the soul and the body in order to account for the relative truths of both transcendental philosophy and naturalism.  The issue concerns how to reconcile the perspective of consciousness as \"universal milieu\" (i. e. , transcendental consciousness) with consciousness as \"enrooted in the subordinated dialectics\", that is, as a Gestalt emerging from lower-order Gestalts (i. e. , perceptual consciousness) (SC: 199/184).  In the natural attitude of our pre-reflective lives, we are committed to the view that our perceptual experience of things is always situated and perspectival (i. e. , that physical objects are presented through \"profiles\", Husserls Abschattungen), but also that we thereby experience things \"in themselves\", as they really are in the mind-independent world; the perspectival character of our opening onto the world is not a limitation of our access but rather the very condition of the worlds disclosure in its inexhaustibility.  At the level of this prereflective faith in the world, there is no dilemma of the souls separation from the body; \"the soul remains coextensive with nature\" (SC: 203/189).  This prereflective unity eventually splinters under our awareness of illness, illusion, and anatomy, which teach us to separate nature, body, and thought into distinct orders of events partes extra partes.  This culminates in a naturalism that cannot account for the originary situation of perception that it displaces, yet on which it tacitly relies; perception requires an \"internal\" analysis, paving the way for transcendental idealisms treatment of subject and object as \"inseparable correlatives\" (SC: 215/199).  But transcendental idealism in the critical tradition subsequently goes too far: by taking consciousness as \"milieu of the universe, presupposed by every affirmation of the world\", it obscures the original character of the perceptual relation and culminates in \"the dialectic of the epistemological subject and the scientific object\" (SC: 216/200, 217/201).  Merleau-Ponty aims to integrate the truth of naturalism and transcendental thought by reinterpreting both through the concept of structure, which accounts for the unity of soul and body as well as their relative distinction.  Against the conception of transcendental consciousness as a pure spectator correlated with the world, Merleau-Ponty insists that mind is an accomplishment of structural integration that remains essentially conditioned by the matter and life in which it is embodied; the truth of naturalism lies in the fact that such integration is essentially fragile and incomplete.  Since \"integration is never absolute and always fails\", the dualism of mind and body is not a simple fact; it is founded in principle--all integration presupposing the normal functioning of subordinated formations, which always demand their own due.  (SC: 226-27/210) The Structure of Behavior concludes with a call for further investigation of \"perceptual consciousness\", a task taken up by its sequel, Phenomenology of Perception.  In the concluding pages of Structure, Merleau-Ponty offers a preliminary sketch of phenomenologically inspired approaches to the \"problem of perception\" that set the stage for his subsequent work, emphasizing (a) the difference between what is directly given as an aspect of individual lived experience and intersubjective significations that are only encountered virtually; and (b) the distinctiveness of ones own body, which is never experienced directly as one objective thing among many.  The book concludes by identifying the \"problem of perception\" as its encompassing concern: Can one conceptualize perceptual consciousness without eliminating it as an original mode; can one maintain its specificity without rendering inconceivable its relation to intellectual consciousness? (SC: 241/224) The solution requires a \"return to perception as to a type of originary experience\" by means of an \"inversion of the natural movement of consciousness\", an inversion that Merleau-Ponty here equates with Husserls phenomenological reduction (SC: 236/220).  If successful, this rehabilitation of the status of perception would lead to a redefinition of transcendental philosophy \"in such a way as to integrate with it the very phenomenon of the real\" (SC: 241/224).  3.  Phenomenology of Perception Completed in 1944 and published the following year, Phenomenology of Perception (PP) is the work for which Merleau-Ponty was best known during his lifetime and that established him as the leading French phenomenologist of his generation.  Here Merleau-Ponty develops his own distinctive interpretation of phenomenologys method, informed by his new familiarity with Husserls unpublished manuscripts and his deepened engagement with other thinkers in this tradition, such as Eugen Fink and Martin Heidegger.  Phenomenology of Perception again draws extensively on Gestalt theory and contemporary research in psychology and neurology; the case of Schneider, a brain-damaged patient studied by Adhemar Gelb and Kurt Goldstein, serves as an extended case-study.  Psychological research complements and, at times, serves as a counterpoint to phenomenological descriptions of perceptual experience across a wide range of existential dimensions, including sexuality, language, space, nature, intersubjectivity, time, and freedom.  In Phenomenology, Merleau-Ponty develops a characteristic rhythm of presenting, first, the realist or empiricist approach to a particular dimension of experience, followed then by its idealist or intellectualist alternative, before developing a third way that avoids the problematic assumption common to both, namely, their \"unquestioned belief in the world\": the prejudice that the objective world exists as a ready-made and fully present reality.  Phenomenology of Perception introduces its inquiry with a critique of the \"classical prejudices\" of empiricism and intellectualism.  Merleau-Ponty rejects the empiricist understanding of sensation, with its correlative \"constancy hypothesis\", and the role empiricism grants to association and the projection of memory for treating the basic units of sensation as determinate atoms rather than as meaningful wholes.  These wholes include ambiguities, indeterminacies, and contextual relations that defy explanation in terms of the causal action of determinate things.  Intellectualism aims to provide an alternative to empiricism by introducing judgment or attention as mental activities that synthesize experience from the sensory givens, yet it adopts empiricisms starting point in dispersed, atomic sensations.  Both approaches are guilty of reading the results of perception (the objective world) back into perceptual experience, thereby falsifying perceptions characteristic structure: the spontaneous organization or configuration of perceived phenomena themselves, with their indeterminacies and ambiguities, and the dynamic character of perception as an historical process involving development and transformation.  By treating perception as a causal process of transmission or a cognitive judgment, empiricism and intellectualism deny any meaningful configuration to the perceived as such and treat all values and meanings as projections, leaving no basis in perception itself for distinguishing the true from the illusory.  In contrast, Merleau-Ponty argues that the basic level of perceptual experience is the gestalt, the meaningful whole of figure against ground, and that the indeterminate and contextual aspects of the perceived world are positive phenomenon that cannot be eliminated from a complete account.  Sensing, in contrast with knowing, is a \"living communication with the world that makes it present to us as the familiar place of our life\" (PP: 79/53), investing the perceived world with meanings and values that refer essentially to our bodies and lives.  We forget this \"phenomenal field\", the world as it appears directly to perception, as a consequence of perceptions own tendency to forget itself in favor of the perceived that it discloses.  Perception orients itself toward the truth, placing its faith in the eventual convergence of perspectives and progressive determination of what was previously indeterminate.  But it thereby naturally projects a completed and invariant \"truth in itself\" as its goal.  Science extends and amplifies this natural tendency through increasingly precise measurements of the invariants in perception, leading eventually to the theoretical construction of an objective world of determinate things.  Once this determinism of the \"in itself\" is extended universally and applied even to the body and the perceptual relation itself, then its ongoing dependence on the \"originary faith\" of perception is obscured; perception is reduced to \"confused appearances\" that require methodical reinterpretation, and the eventual result is dualism, solipsism, and skepticism.  The \"fundamental philosophical act\" would therefore be to \"return to the lived world beneath the objective world\" (PP: 83/57).  This requires a transcendental reduction: a reversal of perceptions natural tendency to cover its own tracks and a bracketing of our unquestioned belief in the objective world.  Yet this cannot be a recourse to any transcendental consciousness that looks on the world from outside and is not itself emergent from and conditioned by the phenomenal field.  Rather than a transcendental ego, Merleau-Ponty speaks of a \"transcendental field\", emphasizing that reflection always has a situated and partial perspective as a consequence of being located within the field on which it reflects.  The first of the three major parts of Phenomenology concerns the body.  As we have seen, perception transcends itself toward a determinate object \"in itself\", culminating in an objective interpretation of the body.  Part One shows the limits of this objective account and sketches an alternative understanding of the body across a series of domains, including the experience of ones own body, lived space, sexuality, and language.  Through a contrast with pathological cases such as phantom limbs, Merleau-Ponty describes the bodys typical mode of existence as \"being-toward-the-world\"--a pre-objective orientation toward a vital situation that is explicable neither in terms of third-person causal interactions nor by explicit judgments or representations.  The bodys orientation toward the world is essentially temporal, involving a dialectic between the present body (characterized, after Husserl, as an \"I can\") and the habit body, the sedimentations of past activities that take on a general, anonymous, and autonomous character.  While the bodys relation to the world serves as the essential background for the experience of any particular thing, the body itself is experienced in ways that distinguish it in kind from all other things: it is a permanent part of ones perceptual field, even though one cannot in principle experience all of it directly; it has \"double sensations\", such as when one hand touches another, that enact a form of reflexivity; it has affective experiences that are not merely representations; and its kinesthetic sense of its own movements is given directly.  This kinesthetic awareness is made possible by a pre-conscious system of bodily movements and spatial equivalences that Merleau-Ponty terms the \"body schema\".  In contrast with the \"positional spatiality\" of things, the body has a \"situational spatiality\" that is oriented toward actual or possible tasks (PP: 129/102).  The bodys existence as \"being-toward-the-world\", as a projection toward lived goals, is therefore expressed through its spatiality, which forms the background against which objective space is constituted.  Merleau-Ponty introduces here the famous case of Schneider, whose reliance on pathological substitutions for normal spatial abilities helps to bring the bodys typical relationship with lived space to light.  Schneider lacks the ability to \"project\" into virtual space; more generally, his injury has disrupted the \"intentional arc\" that projects around us our past, our future, our human milieu, our physical situation, our ideological situation, and our moral situation, or rather, that ensures that we are situated within all of these relationships.  (PP: 170/137) The bodys relationship with space is therefore intentional, although as an \"I can\" rather than an \"I think\"; bodily space is a multi-layered manner of relating to things, so that the body is not \"in\" space but lives or inhabits it.  Just as bodily space reflects an originary form of intentionality--a pre-cognitive encounter with the world as meaningfully structured--the same is shown to be the case for sexuality and for language.  Sexuality takes on a special significance because it essentially expresses the metaphysical drama of the human condition while infusing the atmosphere of our lives with sexual significance.  Like space and sexuality, speech is also a form of bodily expression.  Language does not initially encode ready-made thoughts but rather expresses through its style or physiognomy as a bodily gesture.  We mistake language for a determined code by taking habitual or sedimented language as our model, thereby missing \"authentic\" or creative speech.  Since language, like perception, hides its own operations in carrying us toward its meaning, it offers an ideal of truth as its presumptive limit, inspiring our traditional privileging of thought or reason as detachable from all materiality.  But, at a fundamental level, language is comparable to music in the way that it remains tied to its material embodiment; each language is a distinct and ultimately untranslatable manner of \"singing the world\", of extracting and expressing the \"emotional essence\" of our surroundings and relationships (PP: 228/193).  Having rediscovered the body as expressive and intentional, Merleau-Ponty turns in Part Two of Phenomenology to the perceived world, with the aim of showing how the pre-reflective unity of co-existence that characterizes the body has as its correlate the synthesis of things and the world; \"Ones own body is in the world just as the heart is in the organism\" (PP: 245/209), and its expressive unity therefore also extends to the sensible world.  Merleau-Ponty develops this interpretation of the sensible through detailed studies of sensing, space, and the natural and social worlds.  Sensing takes place as the \"co-existence\" or \"communion\" of the body with the world that Merleau-Ponty describes as a reciprocal exchange of question and answer: a sensible that is about to be sensed poses to my body a sort of confused problem.  I must find the attitude that will provide it with the means to become determinate . . .  I must find the response to a poorly formulated question.  And yet I only do this in response to its solicitation. . .  .  The sensible gives back to me what I had lent to it, but I received it from the sensible in the first place.  (PP: 259/222) As co-existence, sensing is characterized by an intentionality that sympathetically attunes itself to the sensed according to a dialectic in which both terms--the perceiving body and the perceived thing--are equally active and receptive: the thing invites the body to adopt the attitude that will lead to its disclosure.  Since the subject of this perception is not the idealists \"for itself\", neither is the object of perception the realists \"in itself\"; rather, the agent of perception is the pre-reflective and anonymous subjectivity of the body, which remains enmeshed in and \"connatural\" with the world that it perceives.  The senses are unified without losing their distinctness in a fashion comparable to the binocular synthesis of vision, and their anonymity is a consequence of the \"historical thickness\" of perception as a tradition that operates beneath the level of reflective consciousness (PP: 285/248).  For first-person awareness, ones anonymous perceptual engagement with the world operates as a kind of \"original past, a past that has never been present\" (PP: 252/252).  The pre-historical pact between the body and the world informs our encounters with space, revealing a synthesis of space that is neither \"spatialized\" (as a pre-given container in which things are arranged) nor \"spatializing\" (like the homogenous and interchangeable relations of geometrical space).  Drawing on psychological experiments concerning bodily orientation, depth, and movement, Merleau-Ponty argues that empiricist and intellectualist accounts of space must give way to a conception of space as co-existence or mutual implication characterized by existential \"levels\": our orientation toward up and down, or toward what is in motion or stationary, is a function of the bodys adoption of a certain level within a revisable field of possibilities.  Lived inherence in space contrasts with the abstract space of the analytical attitude, revindicating the existential space of night, dreams, or myths in relation to the abstract space of the \"objective\" world.  The properties of things that we take to be \"real\" and \"objective\" also tacitly assume a reference to the bodys norms and its adoption of levels.  An objects \"true\" qualities depend on the bodys privileging of orientations that yield maximum clarity and richness.  This is possible because the body serves as a template for the style or logic of the world, the concordant system of relations that links the qualities of an object, the configuration of the perceptual field, and background levels such as lighting or movement.  In this symbiosis or call-and-response between the body and the world, things have sense as the correlates of my body, and reality therefore always involves a reference to perception.  Yet, to be real, things cannot be reducible to correlates of the body or perception; they retain a depth and resistance that provides their existential index.  While each thing has its individual style, the world is the ultimate horizon or background style against which any particular thing can appear.  The perspectival limitations of perception, both spatially and temporally, are the obverse of this worlds depth and inexhaustibility.  Through an examination of hallucination and illusions, Merleau-Ponty argues that skepticism about the existence of the world makes a category mistake.  While we can doubt any particular perception, illusions can appear only against the background of the world and our primordial faith in it.  While we never coincide with the world or grasp it with absolute certainty, we are also never entirely cut off from it; perception essentially aims toward truth, but any truth that it reveals is contingent and revisable.  Rejecting analogical explanations for the experience of other people, Merleau-Ponty proposes that the rediscovery of the body as a \"third genre of being between the pure subject and the object\" makes possible encounters with embodied others (PP: 407/366).  We perceive others directly as pre-personal and embodied living beings engaged with a world that we share in common.  This encounter at the level of anonymous and pre-personal lives does not, however, present us with another person in the full sense, since our situations are never entirely congruent.  The perception of others involves an alterity, a resistance, and a plenitude that are never reducible to what is presented, which is the truth of solipsism.  Our common corporeality nevertheless opens us onto a shared social world, a permanent dimension of our being in the mode of the anonymous and general \"someone\".  The perception of others is therefore a privileged example of the paradox of transcendence running through our encounter with the world as perceived: Whether it is a question of my body, the natural world, the past, birth or death, the question is always to know how I can be open to phenomena that transcend me and that, nevertheless, only exist to the extent that I take them up and live them.  (PP: 422/381) This \"fundamental contradiction\" defines our encounters with every form of transcendence and requires new conceptions of consciousness, time, and freedom.  The fourth and final section of Phenomenology explores these three themes, starting with a revision of the concept of the cogito that avoids reducing it to merely episodic psychological fact or elevating it to a universal certainty of myself and my cogitationes.  Merleau-Ponty argues that we cannot separate the certainty of our thoughts from that of our perceptions, since to truly perceive is to have confidence in the veracity of ones perceptions.  Furthermore, we are not transparent to ourselves, since our \"inner states\" are available to us only in a situated and ambiguous way.  The genuine cogito, Merleau-Ponty argues, is a cogito \"in action\": we do not deduce \"I am\" from \"I think\", but rather the certainty of \"I think\" rests on the \"I am\" of existential engagement.  More basic than explicit self-consciousness and presupposed by it is an ambiguous mode of self-experience that Merleau-Ponty terms the silent or \"tacit\" cogito--our pre-reflective and inarticulate grasp on the world and ourselves that becomes explicit and determinate only when it finds expression for itself.  The illusions of pure self-possession and transparency--like all apparently \"eternal\" truths--are the results of acquired or sedimented language and concepts.  Rejecting classic approaches to time that treat it either as an objective property of things, as a psychological content, or as the product of transcendental consciousness, Merleau-Ponty returns to the \"field of presence\" as our foundational experience of time.  This field is a network of intentional relations, of \"protentions\" and \"retentions\", in a single movement of dehiscence or self-differentiation, such that \"each present reaffirms the presence of the entire past that it drives away, and anticipates the presence of the entire future or the 'to-come\" (PP: 483/444).  Time in this sense is \"ultimate subjectivity\", understood not as an eternal consciousness, but rather as the very act of temporalization.  As with the tacit cogito, the auto-affection of time as ultimate subjectivity is not a static self-identity but involves a dynamic opening toward alterity.  In this conception of time as field of presence, which \"reveals the subject and the object as two abstract moments of a unique structure, namely, presence\" (PP: 494/454-55), Merleau-Ponty sees the resolution to all problems of transcendence as well as the foundation for human freedom.  Against the Sartrean position that freedom is either total or null, Merleau-Ponty holds that freedom emerges only against the background of our \"universal engagement in a world\", which involves us in meanings and values that are not of our choosing.  We must recognize, first, an \"authochthonous sense of the world that is constituted in the exchange between the world and our embodied existence\" (PP: 504/466), and, second, that the acquired habits and the sedimented choices of our lives have their own inertia.  This situation does not eliminate freedom but is precisely the field in which it can be achieved.  Taking class consciousness as his example, Merleau-Ponty proposes that this dialectic of freedom and acquisition provides the terms for an account of history, according to which history can develop a meaning and a direction that are neither determined by events nor necessarily transparent to those who live through it.  The Preface to Phenomenology of Perception, completed after the main text, offers Merleau-Pontys most detailed and systematic exposition of the phenomenological method.  His account is organized around four themes: the privileging of description over scientific explanation or idealist reconstruction, the phenomenological reduction, the eidetic reduction, and intentionality.  Phenomenology sets aside all scientific or naturalistic explanations of phenomena in order to describe faithfully the pre-scientific experience that such explanations take for granted.  Similarly, since the world exists prior to reflective analysis or judgment, phenomenology avoids reconstructing actual experience in terms of its conditions of possibility or the activity of consciousness.  The phenomenological reduction, on his interpretation, is not an idealistic method but an existential one, namely, the reflective effort to disclose our pre-reflective engagement with the world.  Through the process of the reduction, we discover the inherence of the one who reflects in the world that is reflected on, and consequently, the essentially incomplete character of every act of reflection, which is why Merleau-Ponty claims that the \"most important lesson of the reduction is the impossibility of a complete reduction\" (PP: 14/lxxvii).  Similarly, the \"eidetic reduction\", described by Husserl as the intuition of essential relations within the flux of conscious experience, is necessary if phenomenology is to make any descriptive claims that go beyond the brute facts of a particular experience.  But this does not found the actual world on consciousness as the condition of the worlds possibility; instead, \"the eidetic method is that of a phenomenological positivism grounding the possible upon the real\" (PP: 17/lxxxi).  Lastly, Merleau-Ponty reinterprets the phenomenological concept of intentionality, traditionally understood as the recognition that all consciousness is consciousness of something.  Following Husserl, he distinguishes the \"act intentionality\" of judgments and voluntary decisions from the \"operative intentionality\" that \"establishes the natural and pre-predicative unity of the world and of our life\" (PP: 18/lxxxii).  Guided by this broader concept of intentionality, philosophys task is to take in the \"total intention\" of a sensible thing, a philosophical theory, or an historical event, which is its \"unique manner of existing\" or its \"existential structure\" (PP: 19-20/lxxxii-lxxxiii).  Phenomenology thereby expresses the emergence of reason and meaning in a contingent world, a creative task comparable to that of the artist or the political activist, which requires an ongoing \"radical\" or self-referential reflection on its own possibilities.  On Merleau-Pontys presentation, the tensions of phenomenologys method therefore reflect the nature of its task: The unfinished nature of phenomenology and the inchoative style in which it proceeds are not the sign of failure, they were inevitable because phenomenologys task was to reveal the mystery of the world and the mystery of reason.  (PP: 21-22/lxxxv) 4.  Expression, Language, and Art The concepts of expression and style are central to Merleau-Pontys thought and already play a key role in his first two books, where they characterize the perceptual exchange between an organism and its milieu, the bodys sensible dialogue with the world, and even the act of philosophical reflection (see Landes 2013).  In both works, Merleau-Ponty draws on a range of literary and artistic examples to describe the creative and expressive dimensions of perception and reflection, emphasizing in particular the parallels between the task of the artist and that of the thinker: as the concluding lines of the Preface to Phenomenology of Perception note, Phenomenology is as painstaking as the works of Balzac, Proust, Valery, or Cezanne--through the same kind of attention and wonder, the same demand for awareness, the same will to grasp the sense of the world or of history in its nascent state.  (PP: 22/lxxxv) Expression, particularly in language and the arts, plays an increasingly central role in Merleau-Pontys thought in the years following Phenomenology, when he aimed to formulate a general theory of expression as the grounding for a philosophy of history and culture. This interest is first reflected in a series of essays addressing painting, literature, and film published in the years immediately following Phenomenology (in Merleau-Ponty 1996b/1964).  These include Merleau-Pontys first essay on painting, \"Cezannes Doubt\", which finds in Cezanne a proto-phenomenological effort to capture the birth of perception through painting.  Cezanne epitomizes the paradoxical struggle of creative expression, which necessarily relies on the idiosyncracies of the artists individual history and psychology, as well as the resources of the tradition of painting, but can succeed only by risking a creative appropriation of these acquisitions in the service of teaching its audience to see the world anew.  Similarly, Leonardo da Vincis artistic productivity is explicable neither in terms of his intellectual freedom (Valery) nor his childhood (Freud) but as the dialectic of spontaneity and sedimentation by which Merleau-Ponty had formerly defined history.  In 1951, Merleau-Ponty summarizes his research after Phenomenology as focused on a \"theory of truth\" exploring how knowledge and communication with others are \"original formations with respect to perceptual life, but . . .  also preserve and continue our perceptual life even while transforming it\" (UMP: 41-42/287).  Expression, language, and symbolism are the key to this theory of truth and provide the foundation for a philosophy of history and of \"transcendental\" humanity.  Whereas the study of perception could only provide a \"bad ambiguity\" that mixes \"finitude and universality\", Merleau-Ponty sees in the phenomenon of expression a \"good ambiguity\" that \"gathers together the plurality of monads, the past and the present, nature and culture, into a single whole\" (UMP: 48/290).  Many of Merleau-Pontys courses from 1947 through 1953 at the University of Lyon, the Sorbonne, and the College de France focus on language, expression, and literature. The manuscript partially completed during these years and published posthumously as The Prose of the World (1969/1973) pursues these themes through a phenomenological investigation of literary language and its relationship with scientific language and painting.  Critiquing our commonsense ideal of a pure language that would transparently encode pre-existing thoughts, Merleau-Ponty argues that instituted language--the conventional system of language as an established set of meanings and rules--is derivative from a more primordial function of language as genuinely creative, expressive, and communicative.  Here he draws two insights from Saussurian linguistics: First, signs function diacritically, through their lateral relations and differentiations, rather than through a one-to-one correspondence with a conventionally established meaning.  Ultimately, signification happens through the differences between terms in a referential system that lacks any fixed or positive terms.  This insight into diacritical difference will later prove important to Merleau-Pontys understanding of perception and ontology as well (see Alloa 2013a).  Second, the ultimate context for the operation of language is effective communication with others, by which new thoughts can be expressed and meanings shared.  Expression accomplishes itself through a coherent reorganization of the relationships between acquired signs that must teach itself to the reader or listener, and which may afterwards again sediment into a taken-for-granted institutional structure.  In a long extract from the manuscript that was revised and published in 1952 as \"Indirect Language and the Voices of Silence\" (in Merleau-Ponty 1960/1964), Merleau-Ponty brings this understanding of language into conversation with Sartres What is Literature? and Andre Malrauxs The Voices of Silence.  Sharing Malrauxs criticisms of the museums role in framing the reception of painting, but rejecting his interpretation of modern painting as subjectivist, Merleau-Ponty offers an alternative understanding of \"institution\" (from Husserls Stiftung) as the creative establishment of a new field of meaning that opens an historical development.  The style of an artist is not merely subjective but lived as a historical trajectory of expression that begins with perception itself and effects a \"coherent deformation\" in inherited traditions.  Rather than opposed as silent and speaking, painting and language are both continuations of the expressivity of a perceptual style into more malleable mediums.  The unfinished character of modern painting is therefore not a turn from the objectivity of representation toward subjective creation but rather a more authentic testament to the paradoxical logic of all expression.  Merleau-Ponty returns to the analysis of painting in his final essay, \"Eye and Mind\" (1964a OEE), where he accords it an ontological priority--between the linguistic arts and music--for revealing the \"there is\" of the world that the operationalism of contemporary science has occluded.  It is by \"lending his body to the world that the artist changes the world into paintings\" (OEE: 16/353), and this presupposes that the artists body is immersed in and made of the same stuff as the world: to touch, one must be tangible, and to see, visible.  Merleau-Ponty describes this as an \"intertwining\" or \"overlapping\", in which the artists situated embodiment is the other side of its opening to the world.  There is as yet no sharp division between the sensing and the sensed, between body and things as one common \"flesh\", and painting arises as the expression of this relation: it is a \"visible to the second power, a carnal essence or icon\" of embodied vision (OEE: 22/355).  Descartess efforts, in the Optics, to reconstruct vision from thought leads him to focus on the \"envelope\" or form of the object, as presented in engraved lines, and to treat depth as a third dimension modeled after height and width.  This idealization of space has its necessity, yet, once elevated to a metaphysical status by contemporary science, it culminates in an understanding of being as purely positive and absolutely determinate.  The ontological significance of modern painting and the plastic arts--e. g. , Klee, de Stael, Cezanne, Matisse, Rodin--lies in the alternative philosophy that they embody, as revealed through their treatment of depth, color, line, and movement.  Ultimately, such works teach us anew what it means to see: Vision is not a certain mode of thought or presence to self; it is the means given me for being absent from myself, for being present from the inside at the fission of Being only at the end of which do I close up into myself.  (OEE: 81/374) 5.  Political Philosophy From the first issue of Les Temps Modernes in October 1945 until his death, Merleau-Ponty wrote regularly on politics, including reflections on contemporary events as well as explorations of their philosophical underpinnings and the broader political significance of his times.  During his eight-year tenure as unofficial managing editor of Les Temps Modernes, he charted the reviews political direction and penned many of its political editorials.  After leaving Les Temps Modernes in 1953, Merleau-Ponty found new outlets for his political writings, including LExpress, a weekly newspaper devoted to the non-communist left.  Both of the essay collections that he published during his lifetime, Sense and Non-Sense and Signs, devote significant space to his political writings.  He also published two volumes devoted entirely to political philosophy, Humanism and Terror (HT) and Adventures of the Dialectic (1955 AdD).  Always writing from the left, Merleau-Pontys position gradually shifted from a qualified Marxism, maintaining a critical distance from liberal democracy as well as from Soviet communism, to the rejection of revolutionary politics in favor of a \"new liberalism\".  His political writings have received relatively scant attention compared with other aspects of his philosophy, perhaps because of their close engagement with the political situations and events of his day.  Nevertheless, scholars of his political thought emphasize its continuity with his theoretical writings and ongoing relevance for political philosophy (see Coole 2007; Whiteside 1998).  The 1947 publication of Humanism and Terror responded to growing anti-communist sentiment in France fueled in part by the fictional account of the Moscow trials in Arthur Koestlers popular novel Darkness at Noon.  Merleau-Ponty sought to articulate an alternative to the choice Europe apparently faced in the solidifying opposition between the United States and the Soviet Union.  Humanism and Terror criticizes Koestlers portrayal of the fictional Rubochov, modeled on Nikolai Bukharin, for replacing the \"mutual praxis\" of genuine Marxism (HT: 102/18) with an opposition between pure freedom and determined history, the \"yogi\" who withdraws into spiritual ideals or the \"commissar\" who acts by any means necessary.  Turning to an examination of Bukharins 1938 trial, Merleau-Ponty finds there an example of \"revolutionary justice\" that \"judges in the name of the Truth that the Revolution is about to make true\" (HT: 114/28), even though the historical contingency that this entails is denied by the procedures of the trials themselves.  On the other hand, Trotskys condemnation of Stalinism as counter-revolutionary similarly misses the ambiguity of genuine history.  Ultimately, the dimension of terror that history harbors is a consequence of our unavoidable responsibility in the face of its essential contingency and ambiguity.  Although violence is a consequence of the human condition and therefore the starting point for politics, Merleau-Ponty finds hope in the theory of the proletariat for a fundamental transformation in the terms of human recognition: The proletariat is universal de facto, or manifestly in its very condition of life. . . .  [I]t is the sole authentic intersubjectivity because it alone lives simultaneously the separation and union of individuals.  (HT: 221/116-17) A genuinely historical Marxism must recognize that nothing guarantees progress toward a classless society, but also that this end cannot be brought about by non-proletarian means, which is what Soviet communism had apparently forgotten.  Despite the failures of the Soviet experiment, Merleau-Ponty remains committed to a humanist Marxism: Marxism is not just any hypothesis that might be replaced tomorrow by some other.  It is the simple statement of those conditions without which there would be neither any humanism, in the sense of a mutual relation between men, nor any rationality in history.  In this sense Marxism is not a philosophy of history; it is the philosophy of history and to renounce it is to dig the grave of Reason in history.  (HT: 266/153) Even if the proletariat is not presently leading world history, its time may yet come.  Merleau-Ponty therefore concludes with a \"wait-and-see\" Marxism that cautions against decontextualized criticisms of Soviet communism as well as apologetics for liberal democracies that whitewash their racist and colonial violence.  Revelations about the Gulag camps and the outbreak of the Korean War forced Merleau-Ponty to revise his position on Marxism and revolutionary politics, culminating in the 1955 Adventures of the Dialectic (AdD).  The book begins with the formulation of a general theory of history in conversation with Max Weber.  Historians necessarily approach the past through their own perspectives, but, since they are themselves a part of historys movement, this need not compromise their objectivity.  The historical events and periods within which the historian traces a particular style or meaning emerge in conjunction with historical agents, political actors or classes, who exercise a creative action parallel to the expressive gesture of the artist or the writer.  History may eliminate false paths, but it guarantees no particular direction, leaving to historical agents the responsibility for the continuation or transformation of what is inherited from the past through a genius for inventing what the times demand: \"In politics, truth is perhaps only this art of inventing what will later appear to have been required by the time\" (AdD: 42/29).  Merleau-Ponty finds a similar position articulated by the young Georg Lukacs, for whom \"There is only one knowledge, which is the knowledge of our world in a state of becoming, and this becoming embraces knowledge itself\" (AdD: 46/32).  History forms a third order, beyond subjects and objects, of interhuman relations inscribed in cultural objects and institutions, and with its own logic of sedimentation and spontaneity.  The self-consciousness that emerges within this third order is precisely the proletariat, whose consciousness is not that of an \"I think\" but rather the praxis of their common situation and system of action.  Historical truth emerges from the movement of creative expression whereby the Party brings the life of the proletariat to explicit awareness, which requires, in return, that the working class recognize and understand itself in the Partys formulations.  With this understanding, Lukacs aims to preserve the dialectic of history, to prevent it from slipping into a simple materialism, and thereby to discover the absolute in the relative.  But Lukacs backtracks on this position after its official rejection by the communist establishment in favor of a metaphysical materialism, and Merleau-Ponty finds a parallel in Marxs own turn away from genuine dialectic toward a simple naturalism that justifies any action in the name of a historical necessity inscribed in things.  For the lack of a genuine concept of institution that can recognize dialectic in embodied form, Marxist materialism repeatedly abandons its dialectical aspirations, as Merleau-Ponty further illustrates through the example of Trostkys career.  In the final chapter of Adventures, Merleau-Ponty turns his sights toward Sartres endorsement of communism in The Communists and Peace.  On Merleau-Pontys interpretation, Sartres ontological commitment to a dualism of being and nothingness, where the full positivity of determinate things juxtaposes with the negating freedom of consciousness, eliminates any middle ground for history or praxis.  Since consciousness is unconstrained by any sedimentation or by the autonomous life of cultural acquisitions, it can recognize no inertia or spontaneity at the level of institutions, and therefore no genuine historical becoming.  More centrally, by interpreting the relation between the Party and the proletariat through his own conception of consciousness as pure freedom, Sartre rules out in principle any possibility for their divergence.  This leads Sartre to an \"ultrabolshevism\" according to which the Partys position is identified with the revolutionary agenda, any opposition to which must be suppressed.  In the Epilogue that summarizes Merleau-Pontys own position, he explains his rejection of revolutionary action, understood as proletarian praxis, for remaining equivocal rather than truly dialectical.  The illusion that has brought dialectic to a halt is precisely the investment of historys total meaning in the proletariat, ultimately equating the proletariat with dialectic as such, which leads to the conviction that revolution would liquidate history itself.  But it is essential to the very structure of revolutions that, when successful, they betray their own revolutionary character by sedimenting into institutions.  Drawing on the extended example of the French revolution, Merleau-Ponty argues that every revolution mistakes the structure of history for its contents, believing that eliminating the latter will absolutely transform the former.  Thus, \"The very nature of revolution is to believe itself absolute and to not be absolute precisely because it believes itself to be so\" (AdD: 298/222).  While Soviet communism may continue to justify itself in absolute terms, it is concretely a progressivism that tacitly recognizes the relativity of revolution and the gradual nature of progress.  The alternative that Merleau-Ponty endorses is the development of a \"noncommunist left\", an \"a-communism\", or a \"new liberalism\", the first commitment of which would be to reject the description of the rivalry between the two powers as one between \"free enterprise\" and Marxism (AdD: 302-3/225).  This noncommunist left would occupy a \"double position\", \"posing social problems in terms of [class] struggle\" while also \"refusing the dictatorship of the proletariat\" (AdD: 304/226).  This pursuit must welcome the resources of parliamentary debate, in clear recognition of their limitations, since Parliament is \"the only known institution that guarantees a minimum of opposition and of truth\" (AdD: 304/226).  By exercising \"methodical doubt\" toward the established powers and denying that they exhaust political and economic options, the possibility opens for a genuine dialectic that advances social justice while respecting political freedom.  6.  The Visible and the Invisible The manuscript and working notes published posthumously as The Visible and the Invisible (1964 V&I), extracted from a larger work underway at the time of Merleau-Pontys death, is considered by many to be the best presentation of his later ontology.  The main text, drafted in 1959 and 1960, is contemporaneous with \"Eye and Mind\" and the Preface to Signs, Merleau-Pontys final collection of essays.  The first three chapters progressively develop an account of \"philosophical interrogation\" in critical dialogue with scientism, the philosophies of reflection (Descartes and Kant), Sartrean negation, and the intuitionisms of Bergson and Husserl.  These are followed by a stand-alone chapter, \"The Intertwining--The Chiasm\", presenting Merleau-Pontys ontology of flesh.  The published volume also includes a brief abandoned section of the text as an appendix and more than a hundred pages of selected working notes composed between 1959 and 1961. Merleau-Ponty frames the investigation with a description of \"perceptual faith\", our shared pre-reflective conviction that perception presents us with the world as it actually is, even though this perception is mediated, for each of us, by our bodily senses.  This apparent paradox creates no difficulties in our everyday lives, but it becomes incomprehensible when thematized by reflection: The \"natural\" man holds on to both ends of the chain, thinks at the same time that his perception enters into the things and that it is formed this side of his body.  Yet coexist as the two convictions do without difficulty in the exercise of life, once reduced to theses and to propositions they destroy one another and leave us in confusion.  (V&I: 23-24/8) For Merleau-Ponty, this \"unjustifiable certitude of a sensible world\" is the starting point for developing an alternative account of perception, the world, intersubjective relations, and ultimately being as such.  Neither the natural sciences nor psychology provide an adequate clarification of this perceptual faith, since they rely on it without acknowledgment even as their theoretical constructions rule out its possibility.  Philosophies of reflection, exemplified by Descartes and Kant, also fail in their account of perception, since they reduce the perceived world to an idea, equate the subject with thought, and undermine any understanding of intersubjectivity or a world shared in common (V&I: 62/39, 67/43).  Sartres dialectic of being (in-itself) and nothingness (for-itself) makes progress over philosophies of reflection insofar as it recognizes the ecceity of the world, with which the subject engages not as one being alongside others but rather as a nothingness, that is, as a determinate negation of a concrete situation that can co-exist alongside other determinate negations.  Even so, for Sartre, pure nothingness and pure being remain mutually exclusive, ambivalently identical in their perfect opposition, which brings any movement of their dialectic to a halt.  The \"philosophy of negation\" is therefore shown to be a totalizing or \"high-altitude\" thought that remains abstract, missing the true opening onto the world made possible by the fact that nothingness is \"sunken into being\" (V&I: 121-122/88-89).  This \"bad\" dialectic must therefore give way to a \"hyperdialectic\" that remains self-critical about its own tendency to reify into fixed and opposed theses (V&I: 129/94).  The philosophy of intuition takes two forms: the Wesenschau of Husserl, which converts lived experience into ideal essences before a pure spectator, and Bergsonian intuition, which seeks to coincide with its object by experiencing it from within.  Against the first, Merleau-Ponty argues that the worlds givenness is more primordial than the ideal essence; the essence is a variant of the real, not its condition of possibility.  Essences are not ultimately detachable from the sensible but are its \"invisible\" or its latent structure of differentiation.  Against a return to the immediacy of coincidence or a nostalgia for the pre-reflective, Merleau-Ponty holds that there is no self-identical presence to rejoin; the \"immediate\" essentially involves distance and non-coincidence.  Consequently, truth must be redefined as \"a privative non-coinciding, a coinciding from afar, a divergence, and something like a 'good error\" (V&I: 166/124-25).  In the final chapter, \"The Intertwining--The Chiasm\", Merleau-Ponty turns directly to the positive project of describing his ontology of \"flesh\".  Intertwining [entrelacs] here translates Husserls Verflechtung, entanglement or interweaving, like the woof and warp of a fabric.  Chiasm has two senses in French and English that are both relevant to Merleau-Pontys project: a physiological sense that refers to anatomical or genetic structures with a crossed arrangement (such as the optic nerves), and a literary sense referring to figures of speech that repeat structures in reverse order (AB:BA).  For Merleau-Ponty, the chiasm is a structure of mediation that combines the unity-in-difference of its physiological sense with the reversal and circularity of its literary usage (see Toadvine 2012; Saint Aubert 2005).  A paradigmatic example of chiasmic structure is the bodys doubling into sensible and sentient aspects during self-touch.  Elaborating on Husserls descriptions of this phenomenon, Merleau-Ponty emphasizes three consequences: First, the body as sensible-sentient is an \"exemplar sensible\" that demonstrates the kinship or ontological continuity between subject and object among sensible things in general.  Second, this relationship is reversible, like \"obverse and reverse\" or \"two segments of one sole circular course\" (V&I: 182/138).  Third, the sentient and sensible never strictly coincide but are always separated by a gap or divergence [ecart] that defers their unity.  Chiasm is therefore a crisscrossing or a bi-directional becoming or exchange between the body and things that justifies speaking of a \"flesh\" of things, a kinship between the sensing body and sensed things that makes their communication possible.  Flesh in this sense is a \"general thing\" between the individual and the idea that does not correspond to any traditional philosophical concept, but is closest to the notion of an \"element\" in the classical sense (V&I: 184/139).  Merleau-Ponty denies that this is a subjective or anthropocentric projection: carnal being, as a being of depths, of several leaves or several faces, a being in latency, and a presentation of a certain absence, is a prototype of Being, of which our body, the sensible sentient, is a very remarkable variant, but whose constitutive paradox already lies in every visible.  (V&I: 179/136) The generality of flesh embraces an intercorporeity, an anonymous sensibility shared out among distinct bodies: just as my two hands communicate across the lateral synergy of my body, I can touch the sensibility of another: \"The handshake too is reversible\" (V&I: 187/142).  Sensible flesh--what Merleau-Ponty calls the \"visible\"--is not all there is to flesh, since flesh also \"sublimates\" itself into an \"invisible\" dimension: the \"rarified\" or \"glorified\" flesh of ideas.  Taking as his example the \"little phrase\" from Vinteuils sonata (in Swanns Way), Merleau-Ponty describes literature, music, and the passions as \"the exploration of an invisible and the disclosure of a universe of ideas\", although in such cases these ideas \"cannot be detached from the sensible appearance and be erected into a second positivity\" (V&I: 196/149).  Creative language necessarily carries its meaning in a similarly embodied fashion, while the sediments of such expression result in language as a system of formalized relations.  What we treat as \"pure ideas\" are nothing more than a certain divergence and ongoing process of differentiation, now occurring within language rather than sensible things.  Ultimately we find a relation of reversibility within language like that holding within sensibility: just as, in order to see, my body must be part of the visible and capable of being seen, so, by speaking, I make myself one who can be spoken to (allocutary) and one who can be spoken about (delocutary).  While all of the possibilities of language are already outlined or promised within the sensible world, reciprocally the sensible world itself is unavoidably inscribed with language.  This final chapter of The Visible and the Invisible illustrates chiasmic mediation across a range of relations, including sentient and sensed, touch and vision, body and world, self and other, fact and essence, perception and language.  There is not one chiasm but rather various chiasmic structures at different levels.  As Renaud Barbaras notes, It is necessary . . .  to picture the universe as intuited by Merleau-Ponty as a proliferation of chiasms that integrate themselves according to different levels of generality.  (1991, 352/2004, 307) The ultimate ontological chiasm, that between the sensible and the intelligible, is matched by an ultimate epistemological chiasm, that of philosophy itself.  As Merleau-Ponty writes in a working note from November 1960, the idea of chiasm, that is: every relation with being is simultaneously a taking and a being held, the hold is held, it is inscribed and inscribed in the same being that it takes hold of.  Starting from there, elaborate an idea of philosophy. . .  .  It is the simultaneous experience of the holding and the held in all orders.  (V&I: 319/266; see also Saint Aubert 2005: 162-64) 7.  Influence and Current Scholarship While the generation of French post-structuralist thinkers who succeeded Merleau-Ponty, including Deleuze, Derrida, Irigaray, and Foucault, typically distanced themselves from his work, lines of influence are often recognizable (see Lawlor 2006, 2003; Reynolds 2004).  Irigaray (1993) suggests that Merleau-Pontys ontology of flesh tacitly relies on feminine and maternal metaphors while rendering sexual difference invisible.  Derridas most detailed engagement with Merleau-Ponty, in Le Toucher, Jean-Luc Nancy (On Touching--Jean-Luc Nancy, 2000/2005), criticizes the latters account of touch and ontology of flesh for its tendency to privilege immediacy, continuity, and coincidence over rupture, distance, and untouchability.  Nevertheless, Derrida ultimately suspends judgment over the relation between these two tendencies in Merleau-Pontys final writings.  The legacy of Merleau-Pontys philosophy of embodiment and ontology of flesh is also apparent in the work of subsequent French phenomenologists, including Francoise Dastur, Michel Henry, Henri Maldiney, Jean-Louis Chretien, and Jacob Rogozinski.  Recent English-language scholarship on Merleau-Ponty, inspired by the availability of new materials from his course notes and unpublished writings, has focused on his concept of subjectivity (Morris and Maclaren 2015; Welsh 2013; Marratto 2012), his relationship to literature, architecture, and the arts (Carbone 2015; Locke & McCann 2015; Wiskus 2014; Kaushik 2013; Johnson 2010), and his later ontology and philosophy of nature (Foti 2013; Toadvine 2009).  His work has also made important contributions to debates in cognitive science (Thompson 2007; Gallagher 2005), feminism (Olkowski and Weiss 2006; Heinamaa 2003), animal studies (Westling 2014; Buchanan 2009; Oliver 2009), and environmental philosophy (Cataldi & Hamrick 2007; Abram 1996).

French phenomenologist Maurice Merleau-Ponty (1908-1961) claimed that to understand human awareness we need to focus on the 'lived body and its relationship to the world.  In brief, the idea is that rather than encountering the world in the form of 'raw sensations, human beings see objects as representations perceived specifically though our bodies as they interact with the world.  In this article I will explore Merleau-Pontys concept of the lived body specifically with the aim of understanding what it suggests for artificial intelligence - a discipline whose primary focus is on developing computer systems capable of performing tasks that would otherwise require the mental facility of a human being.  According to Merleau-Pontys understanding of the lived body and the mechanisms of perception, artificial intelligence is doomed to failure for two fundamental reasons.  First, a simulation cannot have the same type of meaningful interaction with the world that an embodied conscious being can have, and the absence of such interactions amounts to a fundamental absence of intelligence.  Second, and perhaps more importantly, a reductionist account of the mind such as is common in artificial intelligence research simply does not paint an accurate picture of what is perceived, experienced and felt by a mind encapsulated within a lived body.  Thus, artificial intelligence cannot be developed by just reverse engineering the brain, nor could it operate in a disembodied environment, as we shall see.  Merleau-Pontys Lived Body Maurice Merleau-Ponty The lived body is a relationship between the body and the external world by which we are capable of being both intelligent and reflective.  Merleau-Ponty states that the lived body is aware of a world that contains data to be interpreted, such as immediate patterns and direct meanings.  One aspect of the lived body that Merleau-Ponty analyses is the role of sense experience, beginning with the truism that our thought is a product of the bodys interaction with the world it inhabits.  More specifically, he states that the subject of perception \"presents itself with the world ready made, as the setting of every possible event, and treats perception as one of these events\" (Phenomenology of Perception, 1962, p. 240).  Merleau-Ponty begins his exploration of the concept of the lived body by reminding us that perception is the key component of our life in the world; but its how we perceive that is important.  For him, the external world is encountered, interpreted and perceived by the body, through various forms of immersive awareness through action.  For instance, colour quality is revealed to experience by a specific type of behaviour by the body, specifically the eye, that is geared toward the colour.  In the eyes case, specific colour-sensitive cells are stimulated in the retina: an interaction.  With further regard to our sense experience and its relationship to the world, Merleau-Ponty writes that \"the objective world being given, it is assumed that it passes on to the sense-organs messages which must be registered, then deciphered in such a way as to reproduce in us the original text\" (PoP, p. 7).  According to Merleau-Ponty, then, there is a consistant connection between the original stimulus of the external world and our elementary perceptual experience of it.  What about our perception of others? Merleau-Ponty writes, \"other consciousness can be deduced only if the emotional expressions of others are compared and identified with, and precise correlations recognized between my physical behaviour and my psychic events\" (PoP, p. 410).  So we recognise the minds of other people by recognising our own behaviour in them.  In fact, for Merleau-Ponty, the interaction with the Other allows for the development of the self.  Elaborating on the connection, he writes that what \"we have learned in individual perception [is] not to conceive our perspective views as independent of each other; we know that they slip into each other\" (ibid).  Everybody Needs Some Body Merleau-Pontys perspective is shared and reinforced by cognitive scientists such as Sandra and Matthew Blakeslee, who write that \"meaning is rooted in agency (the ability to act and choose), and agency depends on embodiment.  In fact, this is a hard-won lesson that the artificial intelligence community has finally begun to grasp after decades of frustration: Nothing truly intelligent is going to develop in a bodiless mainframe.  In real life there is no such thing as disembodied consciousness\" (The Body Has A Mind Of Its Own, 2008, p. 12).  They present the following thought experiment to illustrate the importance of Merleau-Pontys lived body: \"If you were to carry around a young mammal such as a kitten during its critical early months of brain development, allowing it to see everything in its environment but never permitting it to move around on its own, the unlucky creature would turn out to be effectively blind for life.  While it would still be able to perceive levels of light, color, and shadow - the most basic, hardwired abilities of the visual system - its depth perception and object recognition would be abysmal.  Its eyes and optic nerves would be perfectly normal and intact, yet its higher visual system would be next to useless. \" (pp. 12-13) Without embodied access to the environment, the cat cannot develop its nervous system with regard to proper responses to external stimuli.  If correct, this suggests that the prospects for artificial intelligence in a strong sense (i. e.  the creation of a computer simulation or algorithm so sophisticated that it would be conscious) are severely limited for two principle reasons.  The first reason is that artificial intelligence, if we mean the intelligence of an advanced computer simulation, does not possess the faculties needed for constructive interaction.  That is, although a human being may interact with such a computer, it is not the case that the human is thereby helping the simulation progress intellectually.  The popular video game The Sims illustrates what I mean by this.  The player of the game constructs a small world that simulated people inhabit, who partake of a variety of different interactions with each other; appear to sleep, to eat, and to even have goals and go to work.  Nevertheless, it would be perverse to argue that such a simulation could count as an actual instantiation of a world.  In playing the game, it becomes quickly apparent that the little Sims are just 'going through the motions, and all appearance of their intentionality and goal-directed behaviour is just appearance.  More specifically, there is no interaction within the game other than having the characters execute the steps with which they have been programmed.  The program does not learn from any interactions with the world.  Like the cat held captive, there is no chance for the characters to learn.  Therefore, behind the surface of the simulation, there is nothing - no inner life, no thoughts, and no consciousness.  The second reason why artificial intelligence will never achieve consciousness is that it cannot replicate perception; And it does not and will not have the capacity for replicating this without a body that encompasses inner subjective experience.  Visual experience, for example, is more than just the mechanistic process of recording photon impacts.  Human beings know what its like to see a color like red in a context - something that simulated-intelligence algorithms cannot achieve.  Philosophers such as Patricia Churchland and Daniel C.  Dennett raise objections to this line of thinking, arguing that if an intelligence has knowledge of all the physical facts, then it would thereby know what the color red is like, for example.  In other words, there is nothing to conscious awareness over and above knowledge of facts and their representation in some kind of symbol-manipulating system.  In responding to this view, phenomenologist Arthur Melnick says that Churchlands and Dennetts perspective \"depends on there being a phenomenological [experiential] characterization that a physical process can get at or align itself with\" (Phenomenology and the Physical Reality of Consciousness, 2011, p. 108), further stating that \"if what red is like is phenomenologically ineffable (has no intrinsic phenomenological characterization other than [our] having the experience and its being like that), then no matter how complete [a persons] knowledge of physics might be, [they] cannot tell at all what red is like\" (ibid).  In other words, hes claiming that one will never know about the experiential nature of something like red without actually experiencing it: a knowledge of, say, the facts about wavelengths, is not enough, because you cant reduce what its like to have the experience to any sort of description of facts.  Therefore the phenomenological qualities of embodied consciousness cannot be replicated in an artificial form just by programming a computer with facts.  Summary The aim of this article is not to discredit the ever-growing field of computer science and artificial intelligence.  On the contrary, researchers have made impressive breakthroughs, such as writing programs that can defeat grandmasters at chess, or developing search algorithms that allow for lighting-fast data retrieval, and other tasks useful to humanity.  What I did hope to indicate, however, is that if Merleau-Ponty is right that embodiment is a key feature of developing meaningful experience, then the discipline of artificial intelligence can never hope to replicate consciousness solely through the elaboration of algorithms.  We could say that since our intelligence, even our very experience, is not just a product of our brain, but is also a result of the action of our bodies in a physical world.  Artificial intelligence is doomed to fail as an attempt to mimic human intelligence insofar as it lacks elements that correspond to the lived body.  The first and perhaps the most significant reason that artificial intelligence is doomed to fail was illustrated as the lack of human-like interaction.  Algorithms embedded in computer hardware can be so complex as to create the appearance of intelligent behaviour (as seen in the video game example) without the concomitant experiential data of true consciousness which allows human mental interaction to develop.  This suggests that actual intelligence and simulated intelligence belong to fundamentally different categories.  Simulated intelligence simply follows its programming, and unlike actual intelligence, does not have an inner voice.  So it cannot reason, and it cannot accept meaningful (ie conscious) feedback from interaction between the world and a body.  There is much more to mimicking human intelligence than just trying to copy the physical processes of the brain.  At its best, artificial intelligence could mimic the appearance of human behaviour so well that a person will not be able to tell the difference between a human and a computer.  However, it will not be able to replicate the phenomenological experiences of the lived human body, and any attempt to do so will just be another simulation.

", "article_6": "Maurice Merleau-Ponty, (born March 14, 1908, Rochefort, Fr. --died May 4, 1961, Paris), philosopher and man of letters, the leading exponent of Phenomenology in France.  Merleau-Ponty studied at the Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris and took his agregation in philosophy in 1931.  He taught in a number of lycees before World War II, during which he served as an army officer.  In 1945 he was appointed professor of philosophy at the University of Lyon and in 1949 was called to the Sorbonne in Paris.  In 1952 he received a chair of philosophy at the College de France.  From 1945 to 1952 he served as unofficial co-editor (with Jean-Paul Sartre) of the journal Les Temps Modernes.  Merleau-Pontys most important works of technical philosophy were La Structure du comportement (1942; The Structure of Behavior, 1965) and Phenomenologie de la perception (1945; Phenomenology of Perception, 1962).  Though greatly influenced by the work of Edmund Husserl, Merleau-Ponty rejected his theory of the knowledge of other persons, grounding his own theory in bodily behaviour and in perception.  He held that it is necessary to consider the organism as a whole to discover what will follow from a given set of stimuli.  For him, perception was the source of knowledge and had to be studied before the conventional sciences.  Turning his attention to social and political questions, in 1947 Merleau-Ponty published a group of Marxist essays, Humanisme et terreur (\"Humanism and Terror\"), the most sophisticated defense of Soviet communism in the late 1940s.  He argued for suspended judgment of Soviet terrorism and attacked what he regarded as Western hypocrisy.  The Korean War disillusioned Merleau-Ponty and he broke with Sartre, who defended the North Koreans.  In 1955 Merleau-Ponty published more Marxist essays, Les Aventures de la dialectique (\"The Adventures of the Dialectic\").  This collection, however, indicated a change of position: Marxism no longer appears as the final word on history, but rather as a heuristic methodology.  Later he returned to more strictly philosophical concerns. "}}

His career has been going on for over 50 years. Some songs from the 70s are part of Italian culture such as E tu come stai?.  In the 80s he released the two best-selling albums ever in Italy Strada facendo and La vita e adesso.  And in the 90's he embraced World Music with records like Oltre and Io sono qui.  In 2006 he composed the anthem of the 2006 Winter Olympics. Around 1968 he composed the Annabel Lee musical suite, based on a poem by Edgar Allan Poe.  In 1969, he released his first single and recorded the single Signora Lia; a comic song that tells of a lady's marital infidelity, over time the song will become a cult of Italian pop music despite its poor initial success.  He collaborated with Italian singer Mia Martini for her debut album. Success came only in 1972, with the album Questo piccolo grande amore; the homonymous song in 1985 will be awarded as the Italian song of the century.  In 1974, he recorded the album E tu . . .  with Vangelis.  In 1975, it comes out Sabato pomeriggio; a concept album about waiting, based on Giacomo Leopardi's poems.  In 1977, the album Solo; the first in which he makes lyrics, music and production on his own.  In 1978, comes the incredible success with the album E tu come stai?.  Baglioni in the early 1980s In 1981, he produced the hugely successful album Strada facendo.  The following year the Ale-Oo tour starts, the first tour of an Italian singer in the big stadiums.  The name of the tour in fact takes its cue from a typical chorus of football matches.  In June of the same year (1982) Claudio at the age of 31 becomes a father and in one day writes the worldwide hit song Avrai dedicated to his son.  Claudio Baglioni in the mid-80s In 1985, comes the incredible success of the album La vita e adesso, the best-selling album of all time in Italy, immediately after the release of the album begins the 1985 tour that totaled over 1. 5 million spectators with the final concert in Rome which was the first concert in the history of Italian music to be broadcast live on TV, the overwhelming success of the album kicks off another big tour the following year; Assolo a sensational tour consisting of over 30 concerts in the great stadiums of Italy where Claudio Baglioni performs completely alone, without a band, with the help of classical and electric guitar, pianola, piano, synthesizer and MIDI, a technology never tested at the time.  Baglioni live 1986 The live album Assolo is based on the concert at the stadium in the city of Milan to which almost 100,000 people will flock, the triple album was a commercial success in Europe.  The success of Claudio in this decade is so high that around the end of 1985 the first collection for the European market of the singer-songwriter was released, entitled Claudio Baglioni, containing the best ten songs of the singer-songwriter of the 80s.  In 1988, he participated in a concert of the Human Right Now! tour with Peter Gabriel, Sting and Bruce Springsteen.  In 1990, after 3 years of work he released the double album Oltre, an ambitious project with 20 songs that embrace World Music and the participation of great international artists; the album will radically change the Italian music industry.  The concert of 1991 will be decreed by Billboard magazine as the best concert of the year in the world, due to the stage that is located in the center of the stadium with the public surrounding it in the round.  In the same year the European version of the record Oltre is marketed. In 1995, the album Io sono qui was released, which marks Claudio's return to the scene, the disc deals with the theme of comedy, everyday life is in fact a bit of a comedy for everyone where everyone wears a mask without knowing if he is an actor or a spectator of life.  And in 1999, the album Viaggiatore sulla coda del tempo, with the imminent arrival of the new millennium, tackles the theme of modern technologies and at the same time tells of the journey of a traveler towards this unknown future.  Baglioni will subsequently declare that the three albums make up a trilogy of time where each represents the past, present and future respectively.  Baglioni in 1996 On 6 June 1998, he had his last concert of the millennium at the Olympic stadium in Rome, the concert totaled over 100,000 spectators thanks to the stage in the center and the spectators who filled the stadium, still this record remains undefeated by any event, both musical and sporty. In the 2000s, he released the album Sono io, In 2010, he did a series of concerts around the world.  In 2013 he released the album Con voi and in 2020, the album In questa storia, che e la mia.  In 2019, to celebrate 50 years of career, he realizes an incredible concert at the Verona Arena which for the first time is open to the public in its entirety.  With the stage in the center and the spectators filling the entire arena in the round. Baglioni in 2010s In the summer of 2022 the incredible last tour Dodici note begins, where in the first stages he performs in the theaters of Italy with only the piano and then between June and July filling the great outdoor arenas of Verona, Rome and Siracusa for the closing ending with the band. From his union with Paola Massari, Giovanni was born on May 19, 1982 to whom his father dedicated the song Avrai, recorded in just two days in Paul McCartney's studio in London.  The single is released on June 9.  In 1987 Baglioni met Rossella Barattolo for the first time; at the time the songwriter was still married to Paola Massari and therefore they simply worked together.  In 1988, after the marriage crisis with his wife, the two begin dating in secret, after a long separation in 1994 they officially get back together and begin the divorce procedure with his wife, from whom he officially divorced in 2008.

The song's lyrics tell of a young man who is \"tired of dreaming\" and yearns to fly \"free like a bird that escaped its prison. \" Contrary to popular belief, it was not inspired by the death of Peter Fechter, who was killed while trying to cross the Berlin Wall in 1962. According to Pablo Herrero, one of the composers, it was inspired by the yearning for freedom during the dictatorship of Francisco Franco in Spain.  However, Herrero recounts that when he heard the story of Peter Fechter, he was astonished at how precisely it was mirrored in the song. A hit in Spain, it managed to climb the charts without being bothered by censorship because radio presenters circulated the Peter Fechter interpretation.  In this way, the songs criticism of Francoism was ruled out and a certain affinity was projected between its message and the anti-communist ideology of the Spanish regime. The song also became popular in much of Spanish-speaking Latin America, where it took on political overtones.  Banned in Cuba, in Chile it was adopted as an anti-communist anthem and became popular among supporters of the military junta.  The dictatorship that ensued later \"appropriated\" the song. As such it was performed in 1974 during the first post-coup edition of the Vina del Mar International Song Festival by Edmundo Arrocet while Augusto Pinochet was in the public. In 1976 the song was again performed at the Vina del Mar International Song Festival while Pinochet was in the public.  That time it was Juan Bau who sang it. It was one of various songs reported to have been played as a backdrop during the torture of political prisoners during the Augusto Pinochet dictatorship.", "article_1": "Spanish singer (1944-1973) Not to be confused with Dino Bravo Ferri and the second or maternal family name is Llopis.  In this Spanish name , the first or paternal surname isand the second or maternal family name is Musical artist Luis Manuel Ferri Llopis (3 August 1944 - 16 April 1973), better known by his stage name Nino Bravo, was a Spanish baroque pop and ballad singer. Ferri Llopis was born in Aielo de Malferit (Valencia), Spain.  His father, Luis Manuel, a salesman, moved the family to Valencia, in search of better opportunities, when his son was three years old.  Young Luis met, in 1958, bassist Vicente Lopez, who introduced him to other Valencian musicians. [why?] Ferri Llopis discovered he could sing while on a trip with Lopez and Paco Ramon.  Lopez recalled that he was surprised, upon waking up from a nap, to hear him singing Domenico Modugno's hit \"Libero\".  Deeply impressed, Lopez predicted that Ferri Llopis would become a superstar. [citation needed] Meanwhile, Ferri Llopis took a job as a jeweler, also working for his mother, who owned a supermarket.  At age 16 he became a fan of the famous Chilean singer Antonio Prieto, whose song, \"La Novia\" (\"The Bride\"), had become a number one hit in Spain.  Bravo and his friends formed a band, \"Los Hispanicos\", and made a cover recording of \"La Novia\". Bravo also enjoyed Rock & Roll music.  He began singing at a hotel, where he sang his favorite English song, \"Only You\".  Ferri Llopis was later approached by a recording company to sign with their label but he declined as the projected contract would not include the entire \"Los Hispanicos\" band.  In 1964, \"Los Hispanicos\" changed their name to \"Los Superson\".  They won a local radio contest, then moved on to Benidorm, where they became quite popular.  Ferri Llopis was soon after called up for military duty.  Suffering from depression, he later contemplated quitting singing.  While Ferri Llopis was away on military duty, his empresario Lopez befriended Miguel Siuran, a radio personality, who was impressed by Los Superson's sound and wanted to help them get a recording contract.  Lopez declined as he felt Ferri Llopis should be included.  When Ferri Llopis returned from his military service, Lopez talked to him about the contract, but Siuran was initially doubtful, questioning the young man's singing ability, asking if he could sing like Tom Jones, Engelbert Humperdinck or John Rowles. [citation needed] Siuran, however, became impressed with Ferri Llopis and took him to a music festival.  Although Bravo did not win at the festival, Siuran became convinced that it was time for Bravo to become a star; soon afterwards, Siuran came up with the artistic name of Nino Bravo.  Bravo and Siuran first tried unsuccessfully to get a contract with RCA.  They then went to Fonogram, in Madrid.  Bravo and Siuran returned to Valencia, where Siuran published a newspaper ad announcing \"Nino Bravo y Los Superson\".  Shortly thereafter, Fonogram called to offer a contract for an album with the band.  In March 1969, shortly after their album hit the market, Bravo sang before a live audience for the first time.  After the concert, frenzied admirers tore down Bravo's concert posters. On 20 April 1970, he married Maria Amparo Martinez Gil and their first daughter, Maria Amparo Ferri Martinez, was born in 1972.  They would have a second daughter, Eva, born after her father's death.  Fonogram wanted Bravo to go solo; in 1970, Siuran was replaced by Jose Meri as Bravo's manager. In 1970, Bravo participated for the first time in the prestigious Barcelona Music Festival.  He would not gain international acclaim until two festivals later, however.  After Bravo received favorable reviews from a festival audience in Athens, Greece, he went on to impress festival goers at the Rio de Janeiro Festival.  After being exposed to international audiences in Europe and Latin America, Bravo and Meri parted ways, and Bravo took on a new manager.  His first solo album was soon released, and the song \"Te quiero, te quiero\", by the composer Augusto Alguero, became an international hit, which is now considered a classic by many Hispanic music critics.  Bravo's first album, \"Tu Cambiaras\" (\"You Will Change\"), sold well, particularly in Colombia.  Bravo later went on tour in Colombia and Brazil, where he participated, for a second time in the Rio de Janeiro Festival.  In 1971, Bravo recorded his second album, later posthumously released in CD format as \"Puerta de amor\" (\"Love's Door\"). In 1972, Bravo released a third album, \"Libre\" (\"Free\"), which was a huge success and led to him becoming widely known in Argentina, Colombia, Chile, Mexico, Ecuador, Puerto Rico, Venezuela, the Dominican Republic, Peru, and among the Hispanic population of the United States.  The song also ended up taking on political associations in the hispanophone world - it was popular among supporters of the Pinochet regime, while other Latin American dictators of the time banned the album, including Fidel Castro. [citation needed] Bravo was also banned from singing in certain countries.  A song that he released in 1973, \"Un beso y una flor\" (\"A Kiss and a Flower\") became one of Bravo's greatest international hits. (Loosely translated, the song's chorus was \"upon leaving, a kiss and a flower, an 'I love you', a caress and a farewell\").  On 14 March 1973, Bravo performed his last concert, before his Valencia fans. On April 16, 1973, Bravo was driving his BMW 2800 along with the Humo duo and Miguel Diurni when his car was involved in a crash about 100 km southeast of Madrid. He died en route to hospital from his injuries, aged 28. He had just signed a five-year record deal with the European record label Polydor. [citation needed] The official cause of death was not clarified and it was said he died from a hemopneumothorax and polytrauma.", "article_2": "When Spanish vocalist Nino Bravo (born: Luis Manuel Ferri Llopis) died in an automobile accident on April1 6, 1973, the world lost one of its greatest romantic balladeers.

He continued his success as a member of early-1960s trio, Los Hispanicos, and after serving a breif stint in the military, with the group, Uamado Superson.  Launching his solo career with a recital at El Teatro Prinicpal of Valencia in 1968, Bravo signed a five year recording contract with Fonogram.  His first single, \"Como Todos\" b/w \"Es El Viento\", composed by Manuel Alejandro, was a major hit in Spain.  Bravo reached his apex in 1972.  Shortly after marrying vocalist Maria Amparo, he represented Spain with a crowd-pleasing set at the Festival de Rio de Janeiro.  In 1997, Alejandro produced an album, Duetos 2, featuring remixes of his songs and electronically-simulated duets with various artists. "}}

Kozani was probably founded by Christian settlers who, after the Ottoman conquest, withdrew from the plains of Macedonia into the mountains, during 14th and 15th century. The Municipal library of Kozani called \"Kovendareios\" is the second biggest in Greece, and it has 150,000 books, rare publications, valuable documents, and one of the rare copies of Rigas Feraios Charter.  For this reason Kozani was included in the National Cultural Network of Cities with object the promotion of the Book and Reading.  Thus it was established the Institute of Book and Reading and Kozani is known as city of Book. Kozani carnival The most interesting local celebration during the carnival are the Fanoi (great bonfires), which lit at the squares of Kozani.  Around them, people sing and dance mainly scoptic songs and local dances, such as the most known song in the region - the Enteka of Kozani (,), often called Kozani's \"national anthem\".

Interurban coaches (\"KTEL\" buses) are by far the most convenient way to travel around Greece, as well as for intra-regional travelling.  There is frequent bus service from Athens Kifissias Station to Kozani 4 times a day (cost is about EUR30 - 470 km), as well as from Thessaloniki bus terminal \"Macedonia\" to Kozani every hour from 06:00 am to 10:00 am (about EUR 10).

Citizen soldiers proved to be a mobile category that moved between fronts, experiences, and ideas.  The project draws from grassroots sources such as diaries, memoirs, letters, postcards, songs, petitions besides newspapers, articles of association, and state and military archives.  In conversation with the recent historiography on societies at war, comparative studies and social movements theories it argues that the war period between 1912 and 1923 proved transformative for both Greek and Ottoman citizen soldiers and had as a consequence their emergence as a modern political organization whose radicalization was formed as a denial to the monarchical past.  BIOGRAPHY Charalampos Minasidis is a Ph. D.  candidate in Modern European and Middle Eastern History at the University of Texas at Austin.  His work examines the transformative experiences, the cultures of war and the radicalization against the monarchy of both Greek and Ottoman citizen soldiers during the early 20th century.

There is also a hidden gem in this area: a museum about Greek folk music and instruments.  This museum is a nice getaway from the many archaeological sites and antiquities found in the area.  The Museum of Greek Folk Instruments' Foivos Anogianakis Collection recently became part of the Museum of Greek Folk Art.  In June 1991, the museum opened its doors to the public and presented the incredible collection of more than 1200 folk instruments from the 18th century until today.  The collection belongs to Foivos Anogianakis, a musicologist who conducted research on the matter that lasted around 40 years.  The museum is composed of three floors, each focusing on a different group of instruments.  Groups are created based on the material that produces the sound, from membrane to strings.  In each case, there is an audio system that allows visitors to listen and understand each instrument's sound.  The museum is located in an 1840s house in Plaka, next to the Roman Agora.  The mansion belonged to Georgios Lassanis, a prominent figure of the 1821 war for independence.  Lassanis, born in Kozani in 1793, was also a politician and a theatrical playwright.  He was forced by Ali Pasha, an Ottoman ruler, to leave Greece and headed to Budapest.  In 1813, he went to Leipzig, Germany and studied philology for four years.  Then, in 1818, he joined the Society of Friends (\"Filiki Eteria\"), a secret 19th century organization whose purpose was to overthrow the Ottoman rule of Greece.  After the war, he served as a minister of military and finance.  He died in Athens in 1870.

The two floors have kept their original wooden floors; the floors are connected by a beautiful wooden staircase that travels visitors back in time.  The newest addition is the dark painted walls that contrast with the artifacts.  The basement is decorated by stone arches, a reference to traditional Greek village houses.

The house is the former residence of the military officer, politician and scholar Georgios Lassanis who played a prominent role in Greeces War of Independence.  In 1978, Foivos Anoyanakis, a musicologist and pioneering researcher of Greek traditional music, donated his collection of 1200 musical instruments along with his library and archives to the Greek State.  The Lassanis House was renovated by the Greek Ministry of Culture and about 600 musical instruments from the Anoyanakis collection went on display when the Museum opened its doors to the public in 1991.  \"Greek folk clarinet, Museum of Greek Folk Musical Instruments\" Photo Credits:Tilemahos Efthimiadis As you enter the museum, you step into an oasis of calm around a courtyard with high walls that was traditional of the Ottoman style of the day.

Giambattista Nolli (or Giovanni Battista) [April 9, 1701 - July 3, 1756], was an Italian architect and surveyor.  He is best known for his ichnographic plan of Rome, the Pianta Grande di Roma which he began surveying in 1736 and engraved in 1748, and now universally known as the Nolli Map.  The map is composed of 12 copper plate engravings that together measure 176 centimetres (69 in) by 208 centimetres (82 in).  It was produced and published in response to the commission of Pope Benedict XIV to survey Rome in order to help create demarcations for the 14 traditional rioni or districts. It was by far the most accurate description of Rome produced to date at a time when the architectural achievement of the Papacy was in full flower. Born in 1701 in Castiglione d'Intelvi (Como), he moved to Rome thanks to the patronage of members of the patrician Albani and Corsini families.  As an architect, he worked on the churches of Sant'Alessio on the Aventine Hill (1743) and Santa Dorotea in Trastevere (1751-1756). The Nolli map reflects Bufalini's map of 1551, with which Nolli readily invited comparison, however Nolli made a number of important innovations.  Firstly, Nolli reorients the city from east (which was conventional at the time) to magnetic north, reflecting Nolli's reliance on the compass to get a bearing on the city's topography.  Secondly, though he follows Bufalini in using a figure-ground representation of built space with blocks and buildings shaded in a dark poche, Nolli represents enclosed public spaces such as the colonnades in St.  Peter's Square and the Pantheon as open civic spaces.  Finally, the map was a significant improvement in accuracy, even noting the asymmetry of the Spanish Steps.  The map was used in government planning for the city of Rome until the 1970s; it was used as a base map for all Roman mapping and planning up to that date.  The map is framed with a vedute by Stefano Pozzi.  A scaled-down edition, a collaboration between Nolli and Giovanni Battista Piranesi, was published in the same year the original map was finished.  Piranesi was instrumental in getting the work printed; Giuseppe Vasi also contributed. References  There have been a number of facsimile editions of the Nolli Map, two are listed here:", "article_1": "Giambattista Nolli was an Italian architect known for encapsulating the urban fabric of central Rome through his map in 1748.  Nolli map was published after Pope Benedict XIV commissioned for the survey to create demarcations between the 14 traditional districts.  Nolli map was used as the reference in government planning of the city of Rome until 1970 and is still widely used as a base map and for educational purposes.  Giambattista reoriented the city to the magnetic north for the \"Pianta Grande di Roma\" or the Nolli map and explained the relationship between the public and private spaces in the city.  The map was made up of 12 engraved copper plates currently stored in Calcografia in Rome, measuring 167cm x 208cm.  The map was published as twelve large sheets with five sheets of index and two smaller maps on single sheets.  Lets have a detailed look at the Nolli Plan: 1.  Design The Nolli map was made to understand urban analysis and to utilise it as a tool while conceiving new projects with precise alignment of building and spaces as per viewing conditions.  The map showcases the detailed plans of churches, theatres, aqueducts, obelisks, fountains, courtyards, porticoes of buildings along with the entrance and staircase for major structures, city walls and much more.  All structures have been depicted with their terrain slopes for better understanding.  Planning Giambattista with this plan attempted for a uniform representation of the city of Rome with an understanding of the urban fabric.  He used easy to understand cartographic symbols for the representation.  All the modern building fabric or the private spaces were marked dark grey, open spaces were marked white, including the interior of public buildings like Pantheon and St.  Peters Square.  This map even noted the asymmetry of Spanish Steps.  All ancient monuments were marked in black indicating extant ruins with a white outline to depict the hypothetical plans for these monuments.  Terrain slopes were marked as a series of textured elongated lines (topography & contours were uncommon till the 19th century).  Landscape features like gardens, vineyards and orchards have been rendered with different textures.  Several cartographic symbols are used to indicate drains, soldiers billets and cemeteries whereas various pictorial symbols represent river crafts, ferry boats, cargo craft and watermills.  The plan shows a vital urban centre that served as a retreat for both rich and poor.  Design Solutions In the 17th century, cities were represented by pictorial maps that focused more on artistry than accuracy.  These pictorial maps showcased a birds eye view of the city that emphasized on the landmarks; hence it was not much useful for wayfinding and urban management.  Giambattista Nolli with his works attempted to depict the planning of Rome for a better understanding with a cartographic approach to provide an accurate orthogonal view of Rome.  The graphical representations of the figure-ground diagram proved to be an important tool in understanding the built form patterns and continuity of the open space.  Nolli also adopted a numerical indexing system for the 1320 structures arranged topographically by administrative region or Rioni.  With this map, Nolli could provide us with the minute details and features present in the city, for example:  A small corner fountain at the corner of Via Sistina and Piazza Barberini (now shifted to Via Veneto corner)  Depiction of two elevated galleries connecting the two parts of the Carceri Nuove  - Marking of the four tiny dots in Piazza S.  Pietro marking the centres of arcs of circles for the oval showing the plan of the colonnades.  \"Nollis map of the mid-eighteenth century reveals the sensitive and complex connections between public and private space in Rome.  Private buildings are shown in grey cross hatching that is carved into by the public spaces, exterior and interior.  These spaces, open or roofed are shown in minute detail through darker poche.  Interiors of the churches read like piazzas and courtyards of palaces, yet a variety of qualities and scales is articulated. \" -Robert Venturi 2.  Techniques followed while drafting Nolli Plan In the process of drafting the map, Nolli did not observe the city from any specific point of view, rather he walked through the streets, alleys, gardens to measure the exact angles and distances for buildings, fountains, ruins, walls, streets to achieve remarkably detailed maps.  With the orientation of the map along the north-south line, Nolli could refer back to his sightings to the baseline or any other part of the drawing.  3.  Sustainability Nolli Plan was the first detailed map for any city and was referred for centuries while planning structures in Rome.  The \"Pianta Grande di Roma\" or the Nolli map is a detailed document with iconographic schema, precise technical scale and accurate north alignment with illustrative cartographic symbols, detailed numerical indices and textual labels that explain the social, artistic and scientific context of Rome.  Even after centuries the map has retained its accuracy with several notable landmarks like Colosseum and Pantheon still standing tall.

It was released in 2017, after it premiered in the competition of the Venice Film Festival in 2016. Martin Koolhoven was born on 25 April 1969 in The Hague in the Netherlands.  Koolhoven went to the Dutch Film Academy (in Amsterdam) and graduated in 1996 as a screenwriter and director. His first film was a 53-minute television film named Duister Licht (\"Dark Light\"). His second film Suzy Q featured actress Carice van Houten, who Koolhoven worked with several times in the films to come.  It was also the feature debut of actor Michiel Huisman. His first (Dutch) cinematic release was AmnesiA (2001), which also got a small release in New York City. In 2004, Koolhoven was one of the New Faces In European Cinema as presented by Pedro Almodovar at the AFI festival (Hollywood). In 2005 Koolhoven directed Schnitzel Paradise.  The film was shown at many international film festivals, including the Berlin Film Festival and the Karlovy Vary Film Festival where it was part of the Variety Critic's choice.  In the same year Koolhoven released Bonkers, a children's movie.  In 2008 Koolhoven made Oorlogswinter (Winter in Wartime), a Dutch movie based on the novel by the same name, written by Jan Terlouw.  The movie was the Dutch entry for the Academy Awards but failed to get nominated.  The movie was distributed in the United States by Sony Classics and was sold to about 25 other countries. In 2010, Koolhoven started his own production company, together with producer Els Vandevorst, called N279 Entertainment that produced several movies.  His first production for N279 Entertainment as a director was the western named Brimstone.

", "article_2": "The spartan world of Martin Koolhovens sober, well-made World War II melodrama, \"Winter in Wartime,\" is a rustic blue-gray landscape of woods and snow-covered roads through which armed German soldiers roam in trucks.  This handsome film, set in a village in the Nazi-occupied Netherlands and shot in Lithuania, is an adaptation of a semiautobiographical 1972 novel by the Dutch author Jan Terlouw, who lived under German occupation for five years.  This coming-of-age story, set in 1945, contemplates the fog of war and the mysteries of adult life through the eyes of Michiel (Martijn Lakemeier), the 13-year-old son of the towns stoic mayor, Johan van Beusekom (Raymond Thiry).  The screenplay, by Mr.  Koolhoven, Paul Jan Nelissen, and Mieke de Jong, evokes the acute yearning for adult experience and validation of a boy on the threshold of adolescence.  Michiel has arrived at that impatient moment when he is considered too young to be privy to adult secrets but hates being treated like a child, and he is itching to prove himself a man.  Telling a story from such a naive perspective cuts two ways.  The plot isnt as clearly outlined as you might wish, and character development is necessarily limited to a childs-eye view.  At the same time the movie immerses you in the consciousness of a restless boy desperate for initiation into the rest of his life.  Michiel views his fathers uneasy cooperation with the Nazi authorities with disdain, even though it is essential to maintaining the fragile peace in the area.  In other ways the father-son bond is solid; in a touching scene Johan takes pains to show the still-beardless Michiel how to shave with a straight razor. ", "article_3": "It was very, very hard to narrow it down to a top ten.  And the nearer I got, the less exotic the list became.  I had to fight my ego; did I want to look original (and put in a poliziesco or a giallo) or was I going to be truthful? In the end my conscience won.  Only one really surprising title, I guess.  Some will frown at the choice of A Fistful of Dynamite but no matter what people can say against it, I love the film.  It speaks to me.  I dont care what the best movies are, I am giving a list of the movies that I love most.  Amarcord: Fellini is walking on sunshine in this perfect celebration of his youth.  I saw the movie for the first time as a young boy and, phew, those enormous breasts of the buxom tobacco saleswoman (played Maria Antonietta Beluzzi) made an impression.  Blade Runner: After this movie, every science-fiction filmmaker had to ask himself, do I want my movie to look like Blade Runner or do I go a completely different way? A hinge movie in terms of style, then, but one that intelligently talks about the great questions of life.  Rutger Hauer was never better than here.  This is one of those rare movies that make you cry for the villain.  Once Upon a Time in the West: Sergio Leone set out to make the western to end all westerns and he succeeded.  Recently people have started to think that television series can be as great as cinema.  Sure, I like Deadwood, but its Sesame Street compared to this.  Recently somebody told me that good television is about the small things in life and good cinema is about the great things.  I think he is right.  This movie is about the great and important things in life, in a grandiose way.  Ambition is good.  Citizen Kane: Its hard to grasp how shockingly original this movie must have been back in 41.  But even without the shock value this movie is a tour de force by the ridiculously young Orson Welles.  Giu la testa: Leone did not necessarily want to direct this one himself and some of the stories about the troubled production made it far too easy to dismiss the movie as one of his minor works.  At first the movie seems political, but it is more a movie about friendship.  And no matter what the stories are, to me it feels like a labour of love, a movie from the gut.  I saw it many times, but when I showed the new, restored and uncut (!) 35 mm print to an audience I realised that this was probably the most underrated film of all time.  Once Upon a Time in America: I did not set out to put three Leone movies in the top ten (and I should be scorned for omitting Hitchcock, Peckinpah and Kubrick) but I just couldnt let go of his so called 'America Trilogy.  The word 'epic is being used very easily nowadays, but these movies truly are.  Robert de Niro and James Woods are electric, Ennio Morricone brilliant, and one weeps for what Leone could have done with Stalingrad, the movie he was planning to make when he died.  Seven Samurai: Kurosawa has influenced many great directors and this particular movie has been the blueprint of many action adventure films.  Alas, most of them lack the intelligence of this one.  Some Like it Hot: The best comedy of all time.  I dont know how often I have seen it, but it is impossible not to see the whole thing when you accidentally come across it on TV.  Anybody who does not like this movie has to be a sour individual with serious issues.  A psychiatrist is probably too late, Im afraid.  Billy Wilder was one of the greatest ever.  He could do it all.  The Thing: The proof that remaking a classic masterpiece does not necessarily have to be bad news.  Carpenter went back to the original story by John W.  Campbell and made this smart, macho horror movie filled with paranoia.  Touch of Evil: The second Orson Welles movie in my list.  Citizen Kane is his most acclaimed work but personally I love this one even more.  The story has its wonderful pulpy aspects but Welles gives it tremendous ambivalence and depth.  Directed with great gusto, awesome photography and wonderful music by the great Henry Mancini.

After graduating from film school in 1996, Koolhoven gained notice for his debut film \"Duister licht,\" a made-for-television thriller about a burglar who breaks into a farmhouse and has an unlucky meeting with the ultra-religious owner.  Many of his early films focus on the psychological struggle between children and their parents; \"Suzy Q,\" his first film after \"Duister licht,\" won numerous awards for its depiction of one bizarre weekend in the life of a suburban family and launched the career of frequent collaborator Carice van Houten; while the black comedy \"Amnesia\" explores the twisted dynamic between a creatively blocked photographer and his dying mother.  After adapting author Tim Krabbe's drug trade novel \"De grot\" and filming the surreal thriller \"South,\" Koolhoven enjoyed a rare mainstream success with \"Schnitzel Paradise,\" a romantic comedy centered on a Dutch-Morrocan hotel cook's attempts to win the love of his boss' niece.  After releasing several family comedies, in 2008 Koolhoven returned to his dramatic roots with the award-winning \"Winter in Wartime,\" based on Jan Terlouw's World War II novel about a Dutch boy torn between his resistance-fighter uncle and German-collaborator father.

Two years later, L'isola della fortuna (\"The Island of Fortune\"), based on Bertati's libretto and Andrea Luchesi's music, was performed in Vienna.  During 1770, Bertati visited Vienna several times, where he collaborated with Baldassare Galuppi.  Emperor Leopold II gave Bertati the title of Poeta Cesareo (\"Imperial Poet\") of the Italian Opera in Vienna, previously held by Lorenzo Da Ponte, who, a year earlier, fell in disgrace with the emperor.  He died in Venice, Italy.  During his career as a librettist, Bertati was almost exclusively devoted to writing drammi giocosi.

Mozart's librettist, Lorenzo Da Ponte, certainly knew the earlier opera.

M.  and Sunday, November 11, at 2 P. M.  Don Giovanni (complete title: Il dissoluto punito, ossia il Don Giovanni, [literally The Rake Punished, namely Don Giovanni ]) is an opera in two acts with music by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Italian libretto by Lorenzo Da Ponte.  It is based on the legends of Don Juan, a fictional libertine and seducer.  Don Giovanni was premiered by the Prague Italian opera at the National Theater (of Bohemia), now called the Estates Theatre, on October 29, 1787.  Da Ponte's libretto was billed as a dramma giocoso, a common designation of its time that denotes a mixing of serious and comic action.  Mozart entered the work into his catalogue as an opera buffa.  Although sometimes classified as comic, it blends comedy, melodrama, and supernatural elements (see Stone Guest below).  DID YOU KNOW. . .  The opera was commissioned as a result of the overwhelming success of Mozart's trip to Prague in January and February 1787? The subject matter may have been chosen in consideration of the long history of Don Juan operas in Prague.  The libretto of Lorenzo Da Ponte was based closely on a libretto by Giovanni Bertati for the opera Don Giovanni Tenorio (first performed in Venice early in 1787), although Da Ponte was loath to admit this in memoirs written decades later.  DID YOU KNOW. . .  Don Juan, the fictitious character who is a symbol of libertinism, originated in popular legend and was first given literary personality in 1630 in the tragic drama El burlador de Sevilla (\"The Seducer of Seville,\" translated in The Trickster of Seville and the Stone Guest), attributed to the Spanish dramatist Tirso de Molina? (The Stone Guest is reference to the stone statue that comes alive and brings about Giovannis demise. ) Through Tirsos tragedy, Don Juan became an archetypical character in the West, as familiar as Don Quixote, Hamlet, and Faust.  Subsequently, he became the hero-villain of plays, novels, and poems; his legend was assured enduring popularity through Mozarts opera Don Giovanni, and it would continue to live on, by the 20th century, in movies and other media.  DID YOU KNOW. . .  Don Giovanni was ninth on the Operabase list of the most-performed operas worldwide for the five seasons 2011/2012 through 2015/2016? It has also proved to be a fruitful subject for writers and philosophers.  The sustained popularity of Don Giovanni has resulted in extensive borrowings and arrangements of the original.  The most famous, and probably most musically substantial, is the operatic fantasy, Reminiscences de Don Juan by Franz Liszt.  The minuet from the finale of Act 1, transcribed by Moritz Moszkowski, also makes an incongruous appearance in the manuscript of Liszt's Fantasy on Themes from Mozart's Marriage of Figaro and Don Giovanni.  Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky always regarded Don Giovanni - and its composer - with awe.  In 1855, Mozart's original manuscript had been purchased in London by the mezzo-soprano Pauline Viardot, who was the teacher of Tchaikovsky's one-time unofficial fiancee Desiree Artot (whom Viardot may have persuaded not to go through with her plan to marry the composer).  Viardot kept the manuscript in a shrine in her Paris home, where it was visited by many people.  Tchaikovsky visited her when he was in Paris in June 1886, and said that when looking at the manuscript, he was \"in the presence of divinity. \" So it is not surprising that the centenary of the opera in 1887 would inspire him to write something honoring Mozart.  Instead of taking any themes from Don Giovanni, however, he took four lesser known works by Mozart and arranged them into his fourth orchestral suite, which he called Mozartiana.  The baritone who sang the title role in the centenary performance of Don Giovanni in Prague that year was Mariano Padilla y Ramos, the man Desiree Artot married instead of Tchaikovsky.  DID YOU KNOW. . .  Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-1791) is considered one of the greatest composers of the classical period? He studied and admired the works of Bach, Handel and Haydn, and by the age of 6 was writing his own compositions.  He wrote his first opera, Mitridate Re di Ponto, in 1770 when he was only 14 years old.  While visiting the Vatican, Mozart heard Gregorio Allegris Miserere performed in the Sistine Chapel and he was able to write out the entire score from memory.  Previously, the music had not been reproduced outside the Vatican.  In April 1787, Beethoven, then aged 16, went to Vienna to get two weeks-worth of music lessons from Mozart.

In 1650 he succeeded GJ Vossius in the professorship of history at the university of Amsterdam.  His students included Francis Turretin, and Johann Georg Graevius. His works were very numerous.  In some of them he took a strong critical line with mythological and counterfeit material current as fact in the early modern period.  This brought him the admiration of major Enlightenment intellectuals.  Jonathan Israel writes: . . . the real work of discrediting and disposing of the Oracula Sibyllina, Chaldean chronicles, and Orphic hymns, . . .  seemingly only began, as Diderot noted in 1751, in the 1650s when the Huguenot scholar David Blondel . . .  published his treatise on the Oracula in Amsterdam. In his dissertation on Pope Joan (1647), he came to the conclusion, now generally accepted, that the story is a myth.  Edward Gibbon wrote this in The History Of The Decline And Fall Of The Roman Empire: She was annihilated by two learned protestants, Blondel and Bayle [. . . ] Indignation against him on account of this book came from Protestant polemicists. His 1628 book against Francisco Torres conclusively demonstrated that the Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals were a very learned forgery.  This work was praised by Voltaire, writing in his Dictionnaire Philosophique. Blondel tracked down sources actually used by the Pseudo-Isidore. Later scholarship has sustained his conclusions.  In a work written as he was going blind, he struck back against Jean-Jacques Chifflet, who had written in favour of the Spanish royal family's genealogical claims, over those of the French kings.  In 1655 he produced an anthology of extracts arguing for Protestant eirenicism References ", "article_1": "David regularly advises global financial institutions, investment funds and private operators, on national and cross-border transactions, in project financing particularly in the field of renewable energies and infrastructure.

Following his early education at Saint-Etienne, he studied in Paris and graduated in medicine in 1907.

He later became Medecin des Hopitaux at the \"Hospice Paul Brousse\", head of the foundation \"Dejerine\", and clinical director at the Salpetriere Hospital.  During World War I, Lhermitte studied spinal injuries and became interested in neuropsychiatry.  This led to publications on visual hallucinations of the self.  A deeply religious man, he explored the common territory between theology and medicine, and this led him to interesting studies on demonic possession and stigmatisation.

These pictures were drawn by a 53-year-old woman who experienced visual hallucinations associated with compression of the quadrigeminal plate due to a pineal meningioma.  These hallucinations became less frequent, but did not completely resolve, after tumor removal.  Reproduced from Miyazawa T, Fukui S, Otani N, Tsuzuki N, Katoh H, Ishihara S, et al: Peduncular hallucinosis due to a pineal meningioma.  Case report.  J Neurosurg 95:500-502, 2001.  (c)AANS.  Published with permission.  Jacques Jean Lhermitte ( Fig.  1 ) was among the most accomplished neurologists in modern history, yet he is often overlooked in the neurosurgical literature.  Lhermitte began his career in the study of spinal cord injury, but his work gradually evolved to explore the neurological basis of the mind, laying the groundwork for the field of neuropsychiatry.  He was fascinated with the pathogenesis of hallucinations and was the first to describe the syndrome of peduncular hallucinosis, or complex visual hallucinations, occurring in lucid patients as a result of midbrain injury ( Fig.  2 ).  This syndrome, which is likely underrecognized, has been reported as both a presenting symptom of several tumor types 2 , 6 , 10 , 14 , 25 , 28 , 30 , 31 , 34 and a complication of neurosurgical procedures.  4 , 16-18 , 25 , 29 , 36-39 In this article, we discuss the life of Jacques Jean Lhermitte and the peculiar syndrome of peduncular hallucinosis.  Jacques Jean Lhermitte (1877-1959) Jacques Jean Lhermitte was born on January 20, 1877, in Mont-Saint-Pere, to a family of artists.  His father, Leon Augustin Lhermitte, was a French realist painter, and his brother, Charles Augustin, was a photographer. 15 Vincent van Gogh and Auguste Rodin were family friends.  Lhermittes early education was at St.  Etienne, followed by medical training in the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Paris. 7 He worked under neurologist Fulgence Raymond in the Pathological Anatomy Laboratory and defended his doctoral thesis titled \"Etude sur les paraplegies des vieillards\" (Studies on paraplegia in the elderly) in 1907, graduating with honors.  In 1908, he was appointed director of the neurological clinic at lHopital de la Salpetriere, and in 1910, he was appointed head of Pierre Maries laboratory where he studied neuropathology under Gustave Roussy. 15 During World War I, he worked as a field doctor for 2 years.  Following this, he worked with Henri Claude at the neurological center of the 8th military region in Bourges, where he studied spinal cord injury, neuroendocrine pathology, and neuropsychiatric disorders among war victims and veterans.  After World War I, Lhermitte returned to Paris and was appointed chief of service at Paul-Brousse Hospital in 1919.  In 1923, he received the title of associate professor of psychiatry.  He was also clinical director at La Salpetriere, the premier neuropsychiatric teaching hospital at that time. 3 Despite his academic accomplishments in neurology, he was never awarded the title of professor of neurology because the only existing position in Paris was filled throughout his career. 3 In 1928, he became head of the Dejerine Laboratory.  When World War II began, he again returned to service as a military doctor.  In 1944, he was offered the position of Chair of Psychiatry after the disappearance of the previous chair, Professor Joseph Levy-Valensi.  Lhermitte honorably declined the position in the absence of information regarding the professors whereabouts.  It was later discovered that Professor Levy-Valensi had been arrested and taken to Auschwitz where he was killed. 12 When the position again became available, Lhermitte was no longer eligible due to an age limit.  At his retirement in 1947, he was given an honorary professor appointment in neurology.  Lhermitte was remarkably prolific, authoring more than 800 papers and 16 books on neurology, neuropathology, psychiatry, and even mystical phenomena such as possession.  He is best known for describing the symptom of an electrical shock-like sensation that runs along the spine and/or limbs following flexion of the neck, i. e. , \"Lhermittes sign,\" which is due to irritation or inflammation of the spinal cord. 19,21 Although he was not the first to describe this phenomenon, he was the first to recognize its importance as an early presenting symptom of demyelinating disease. 5 Lhermitte also described internuclear ophthalmoplegia (also known as Lhermittes syndrome), a constellation of pyramidal and extrapyramidal symptoms associated with parkinsonism in the elderly (Lhermitte-McAlpine syndrome),24 dysplastic cerebellar gangliocytoma (Lhermitte-Duclos disease),22 Huntingtons disease,27 and the syndrome of hallucinations caused by damage to the midbrain and pons (Lhermittes peduncular hallucinosis),20 and he contributed to the description of several other diseases of the nervous system.  In his later years, he was fascinated with the organic basis of the mind and psychiatric disease, and is often considered to be one of the fathers of neuropsychiatry. 3,5 Lhermitte died in his sleep at the age of 81 years on January 24, 1959. 7 He was survived by 4 children, including a son, Francois Lhermitte, who became a professor of neurology at La Salpetriere in Paris.  In addition to his scientific contributions, he was recognized as a passionate, engaging instructor3 and \"the most sincere and generous of friends, warm-hearted and tolerant, stimulating and encouraging. \"7", "article_5": "Jean Lhermitte was a renowned French neurologist and psychiatrist, whose name can be found in many medical eponyms, including the Lhermittes sign observed in multiple sclerosis patients.  Jean Lhermitte was born on 30 January 1877 in Mont-Saint-Pere in Champagne, son of Leon Augustin Lhermitte, a French realist painter, and Heloise Goudard.  His younger brother Charles Augustin was a photographer.  Famous artists Auguste Rodin (1840-1917) and Vincent van Gogh (1853-1890) were friends of the family.  Following his early education at Saint-Etienne school in Meaux, he studied in Paris, where he attended clinical classes (externat) in 1896 and worked as a resident (internat) in 1900.  Between 1905 and 1906 he was the deputy of Fulgence Raymond (1844-1910) at the Pathological Anatomy Laboratory.  In 1907, he defended his doctoral thesis entitled Etude sur les paraplegies des viellards (Studies on paraplegia in the elderly) and graduated with honours from the Faculty of Medicine in Paris.  A year later, he was appointed the director of the neurological clinic at lHopital de la Salpetriere alongside Professor Raymond.  In 1910, he was appointed the head of Pierre Maries (1853-1940) laboratory, where, in cooperation with neuropathologist Gustav Roussy, he conducted research on pathological anatomy and histological changes in the nervous system.  During this period his scientific work was less intense due to his wifes illness.  After the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Lhermitte was assigned to an infantry regiment as a field doctor, and a year later he started working with Henri Claude (1869-1945) at the neurological centre of the 8th military region in Bourges, where he conducted research on traumatic spinal cord injuries and neuroendocrine disorders.  He was also interested in neuropsychiatric disorders among war victims and veterans.  In 1919, he was appointed director of the Paul-Brousse hospital in Villejuif.  In 1923, Lhermitte received the title of professeur agrege of psychiatry and took up a position at the Department of Mental and Neurological Diseases in Paris headed by Henri Claude.  Despite his scientific achievements in the field of neurology, Jean Lhermitte was never awarded the formal title of professor of neurology because the only existing position in Paris at the time of his professional activity was already filled.  In 1928, Jean Lhermitte became the head of the Dejerine Laboratory, where he worked until its closure in 1945.  After the outbreak of World War II, he again took care of the sick at the Paul-Brousse hospital.  In 1944, after the disappearance of Professor Joseph Levy-Valensi (1879-1943), he was offered the chair of psychiatry, but not knowing what happened to the professor and in the absence of official information about his death, he nobly refused.  A few years later, the age limit prevented him from taking up the position and instead, he was appointed professeur honoraire in 1948.  In 1947, he had his first heart attack.  Despite his state of health, he continued his scientific work with passion and commitment.  In the summer of 1957 he suffered a second heart attack, which eventually forced him to take a rest and partly withdraw from his scientific career.  Jean Lhermitte died on 2 January 1959 in his sleep at the age of 81.  He is buried in a family grave in the Aisne region in France.  In 1907, Lhermitte married Lucie Megret, but was widowed in 1916 and in 1918 married Marcelle Duflocq.  The couple had four children.  Their son Francois Lhermitte (1921-1998) was a professor of neurology and neuropsychiatry at the Faculty of Medicine in Paris.  Jean Lhermitte was the author of more than 800 scientific papers and 16 books.  His areas of interest included neurology, neuropathology, psychiatry, psychology and even mystical phenomena, as he also conducted research on demoniacal possession and stigmata.  In 1920, together with Paul Duclos, he was the first to describe dysplastic cerebellar gangliocytoma, a rare, benign tumor of the cerebellum of partly unknown etiology, occurring more frequently in men in the second and third decade of life, which is now called the Lhermitte-Duclos disease.  He also described internuclear ophthalmoplegia, which results from a lesion of the medial longitudinal fasciculus connecting the nucleus of the abducens nerve with the motor nucleus of the oculomotor nerve (Lhermittes syndrome).  The disorder manifests itself by the inability to adduct the eyeball on the side of the damage with simultaneous occurrence of nystagmus in the abducted eye.  Together with Douglas McAlpine, he described a set of symptoms characteristic of pyramidal and extrapyramidal system damage occurring in the elderly as a result of atherosclerotic lesions (Lhermitte-McAlpine syndrome).  Characteristic symptoms are muscle stiffness, bradykinesia, as well as facial, throat and laryngeal muscle disorders.  Apathy, hallucinations, delirium, and disorientation may also occur.  He described a symptom in multiple sclerosis patients which consisted in a sensation of a 2-s distal electrical discharge that runs along the spine and limbs in response to an active or passive forward bending of the head.  Although Pierre Marie and Charles Chatelin made the first description of this symptom in 1917, it was Lhermitte who first took notice of the importance of its occurrence as an early sign of multiple sclerosis and suggested its close connection with the demyelination of the posterior spinal cord.  He also proposed possible causes of this phenomenon other than multiple sclerosis [8, 9].  He was the first to describe a syndrome of hallucinations, seen originally in a 72-year-old female patient who saw life-like images of small animals and humanoid creatures, as well as children playing, mainly at dusk, and with partial awareness of their unreality.  On the basis of neurological examination, he proposed the location of the brain damage in midbrain and pons.  This neuropsychiatric disorder is now called Lhermittes peduncular hallucinosis.  In collaboration with Pierre Marie, he presented an early description of the pathology of Huntingtons disease.  He also worked on olivopontocerebellar atrophy, pathogenesis of cerebrovascular diseases, phantom limb pain and many other pathologies of the central and peripheral nervous system, as well as mental disorders (Fig.  1).

S.  13 March] 1908 - 1 June 1979) was a Russian poet and translator. Petrovykh was born in Norskii Posad, a village now within the city limits of Yaroslavl, where her engineer father worked in a cotton factory; her parents were married in 1896, and she was the youngest of five children.  Her sister Ekaterina \"suggests that the thoughtfulness and alertness that accompanied Petrovykh throughout her life were formed during their slow childhood walks with their nanny along the Volga; her sister claims as well that Petrovykh's characteristic independence and determination to carry through her decisions appeared early in life. \" Her mother's brother Dmitri Aleksandrovich Smirnov (1870-1940) and her father's brother Ivan Semyonovich Petrovykh (metropolitan Joseph, 1872-1937) were both priests who fell victim to Stalinist repression.  From 1922 she lived in Yaroslavl, where she taught school and attended Writers' Union meetings; her poetry began to be appreciated there. In 1925 she moved to Moscow, where she continued her studies at the State Higher Literary Courses (fellow students were Arseny Tarkovsky, Yuliya Neiman, Daniil Andreyev, and Yuri Dombrovsky; Tarkovsky described Petrovykh as the best poet of the group).  At this time she married Petr Granditsky, but the marriage did not last long.  She became a friend of both Anna Akhmatova, with whom she remained close until Akhmatova's death, and Osip Mandelstam, who fell in love with her in 1933 and dedicated to her what Akhmatova called \"the best love poem of the twentieth century,\" \"Masteritsa vinovatykh vzorov\" (tr.  by Richard and Elizabeth McKane as \"The expert mistress of guilty glances\").  In 1936 she married Vitaly Golovachev, and in 1937 their daughter Arina was born; a few months after her birth Golovachev was arrested and sentenced to five years in the Gulag (where he died in 1942).  Petrovykh worked as an editor and translator for Moscow publishing houses; in the summer of 1941 she and her daughter were evacuated to Chistopol in Tatarstan, where they spent World War II.  Her translations were primarily from Polish and Armenian but also from Serbo-Croatian, Bulgarian, and other languages.  From 1959 to 1964 she conducted a seminar for young translators along with David Samoylov. As a poet she was much appreciated by a small circle but little known to the wider public; the only book of poems she published during her lifetime was Dalnee derevo (A distant tree), published in Yerevan in 1968.  But Akhmatova considered her \"Naznach' mne svidan'e na etom svete\" (Make me a date on this earth) \"one of the masterpieces of twentieth-century lyric poetry. \" Stephanie Sandler writes: Her obscurity seems to have been at least partially of her own making.  Petrovykh's adult professional identity as editor and translator suitably allegorized the deferential, secondary position she came to prefer.  . . .  Petrovykh did not write a great deal, but she left some exquisite love lyrics and a number of admirably precise poems of natural description.  Her poems typically include some revelation of spiritual truth, and in this they are comparable to work by Anna Akhmatova, to whom Petrovykh knew she would be compared and come out the poorer. Petrovykh died in 1979 and is buried in Vvedenskoye Cemetery in Moscow. ^ Ledkovsky, Rosenthal, and Zirin (eds), Dictionary of Russian Women Writers, p.  502.  ^ My Half Century (Northwestern University Press, 1997, Anna Akhmatova,(Northwestern University Press, 1997, ISBN 0-8101-1485-2 ), p.  90.  ^ The Moscow Notebooks (Bloodaxe Books, 1991), p.  86.  ^ Wilson, Encyclopedia of Continental Women Writers, p.  985.  ^ Stephanie Sandler in Chester and Forrester (eds), Engendering Slavic Literatures, p.", "article_1": "Anna Akhmatova is already known abroad, as are Osip Mandelstam, Boris Pasternak and Marina Tsvetaeva.  Robert Chandler and his fellow translators are concerned that the intense focus on these four, with their dramatic life histories, has overshadowed other talented writers.  A new Penguin anthology of \"Russian Poetry from Pushkin to Brodsky,\" due out by 2015, is set to bring these lesser known poets to light.  Chandler, famous for bringing Soviet greats like Vasily Grossman and Andrey Platonov to English-reading audiences, has already edited two generous compilations of Russian short stories.  Now, together with Russian-American poets Boris Dralyuk and Irina Mashinski, hes overseeing an even more ambitious project, bringing together legions of translators to create an anthology, which challenges the whole idea of Russian poetry in the West.  Actual lives dont fit a pattern To celebrate this poetic collaboration, Londons Pushkin House hosted a \"Russian Poetry week. \" Stephen Capus, who is translating poems by Tsvetaeva, Boris Slutsky and others for the new anthology, told a packed audience of poetry-lovers last week: \"We still understand Soviet poetry in terms of an abstract, binary opposition weve inherited from the Cold War.  There were the 'good poets who lived in opposition to the Soviet Union and 'the others who managed to find places for themselves. \" This divide is over-simple, argues Capus, and leads to great poets being overlooked: \"The reality is that actual lives dont fit that pattern.  Slutskys biography was complicated.  Yes, he supported the denunciation of Pasternak; yet he wrote critical, denunciatory poems about Stalin. \" Slutsky was one of a generation of poets who fought in World War II and his poems reflect this as well as his experience of anti-Semitism and wars aftermath (\"from the rubble we built prisons of our own\").  His poem \"German Losses\" expresses a poignant ambivalence.  It describes a prisoner, cheerfully playing tunes for Russian soldiers and the poets grief for \"that man alone/ who played those German waltzes far from home. \" The structure of thought This excellent translation by Stephen Capus shares the regular rhyme scheme and rhythm of the original.  These techniques, Boris Dralyuk, who lectures in Russian literature at UCLA, explained, were not \"superficial decoration\" for Slutsky: \"they are bound up with the very structure of his thought. \" Discussion of this and similar issues is crucial for translators of poetry.  An unexpectedly large group of translators gathered in Oxford in mid-June to talk about literary translation.  Arseny Tarkovsky was a poet and father of famous director Andrey Tarkovsky.  Source: wikipedia Washington-based poet, Katherine Young, who attended the event, is contributing translations of Vladimir Kornilov to the forthcoming anthology.  \"Forty Years Later\" combines pathos and satire in its description of Andrei Platonov sweeping the yard of the literary institute: \"Thus the writing of that time/ grew strangely inept,/while at the Lit Institute the yard/ was nicely swept. \" Young commented on the odd metrical form she worked with: \"the longer lines are four beats, the shorter ones only two. \" Arseny Tarkovsky was a poet, translator and father of film director Andrey Tarkovsky.  His poems are recited in his sons films \"The Mirror\" and \"Stalker\" and so have reached a wider audience.  Chandlers moving translation of Tarkovskys poem \"How it Was\"conveys the down to earth side of the poet, with the almost child-like rhythms of his evocation of the year 1919, an era of starvation (\"Bread we baked from angry nettles\") and his mothers slow death: \"When she slept I kept on checking/ Was she breathing? Was she not?\" Akhmatova called Tarkovskys verses \"a precious gift to the contemporary reader. \" Poets emerging from the footnotes Chandler points out that Tarkovsky at least had his son to champion him, but Maria Petrovykh (1908 --1979) has become a footnote in the biography of Mandelstam, who dedicated a famous love poem to her.  Petrovykh spent much of her life editing and translating other peoples work and published only one collection of her own poetry during her lifetime.  \"A Distant Tree\" appeared in 1968 when the poet was already 60 years old.  Petrovykh studied in Moscow, alongside Tarkovsky, who described Petrovykh as the best poet of the group.  She herself humbly deferred to the more flamboyant Soviet poets, calling them the \"four corners of the world. \" Chandler presented haunting versions of Petrovykhs poetry: \"But if not you, who else/ is going to love me? Face/ to face, and fate to fate,\" she wrote, in one of her breathtakingly direct poems: \"Love me/ simply, simply, as day/ loves night and night loves day. \" Maria Petrovykh (1908 --1979) was editor and translator and published only one collection of her own poetry.  Source: liveinternet Her intensity is \"both emotional and intellectual,\" said Chandler, reminding him of the English metaphysical poets.  Dralyuks translation of her poem about language (\"words lie empty without breathing\") reinforces this aspect of Petrovykhs poetry.  This years Compass Prize challenges translators to test their skills on a poem by Petrovykh.  The judges feel she deserves more \"universal recognition\" and that \"it is high time for Petrovykh's own verse to benefit from the attention of translators as gifted and inspired as she herself was. \" New translations are opening up the landscape of Soviet poetry, aesthetically and politically.  Journalist Masha Karp explained the need \"to understand those moral choices that everyone under the Soviet Union had to make . . .  how much do you give in? How much do you allow the authorities to take you over and how much do you resist?\" Dralyuk agreed that there are \"complications that arise when one tries to create a context for Soviet poetry. \" A new perspective on the turmoil of the twentieth century gives us \"the opportunity to integrate Soviet poetry into the history of Russian poetry.  The distance we have now allows us to fill the gaps and to see what we have. \" All rights reserved by Rossiyskaya Gazeta. ", "article_2": "Love me.  I am pitch black, sinful, blind, confused.

Each year the competition is dedicated to a particular Russian poet.  The third Compass Award contest (2013) was for translations of Maria Petrovykh (1908-79).  Petrovykh was a poet of exquisite precision and subtlety.  Anna Akhmatova greatly admired her work and she inspired one of Osip Mandestam's most famous love poems.  Yet, unlike her fellow masters, she has not yet attained general recognition.  In part, this is due to her own humility; she published only one collection in her lifetime, and devoted most of her professional life to editing and translating the work of others.  The organizers of the Compass Competiton felt it was time for Petrovykh's own verse to benefit from the attention of translators as gifted and inspired as she herself.  The poet, whose work will be suggested for translation in the 2014 competition, is Arseny Tarkovsky.  A segment of the evening will be dedicated to his work.  ----- Participants: winners and commended translators: Josephine von Zitzewitz (UK), Alexandra Berlina (Germany), Peter Oram (UK-Germany), and Dina Gussejnova (UK).  Also participating are Angela Livingstone, Peter Daniels, and Robert Chandler (Compass judges), Masha Karp, and Poel Karp.  ---- The Compass Translation Award is a part of the StoSvet project, which also includes the (Storony Sveta) and Cardinal Pointsjournals and Stosvet Press publishing house.  The project was co-founded by poets Oleg Woolf (1954-2011) and Irina Mashinski, its current Editor. ", "article_4": "As it turns out, I did not win this years Compass Award for outstanding English language translation of Russian poetry, awarded through the Cardinal Points journal.  I did not even make the short list.  Not too disappointed, though, as it was my first entry to any such competition, and now that I am no longer in the running I can present my work to anybody out there with any interest in the Russian poetry of the Soviet period.  This year the contest asked for translations of poems by Maria Petrovykh, a poet who was a friend of some of the greatest luminaries of the early Soviet period, notably Anna Akhmatova and Osip Mandelstam; Mandelstams poem, Masteritsa vinovatykh vzorov, that Akhmatova called \"the greatest love poem of the 20th century,\" was dedicated to Petrovykh.  The poem of hers I chose to translate for this contest is Muza--'Muse.  As I had not been familiar with ther work until I learned of this competition, I decided this poem would be a good place to start as it might give a clue to what inspired her to write.  It turns out that \"night\" was one of her muses at this time.  This is not that surprising for someone who had just survived WWI, the Russian Revolution, The Russian Civil War, the \"Red Terror,\" unprecedented poltical, economic and social experimentation and the beginnings of Stalinist totalitarianism.  But aside from historical context, I found this to be a beautiful poem, and my humble translation a pale ghost of the real thing.  As always I struggled in my efforts to balance meaning, meter, tone and rhyme.  I feel convinced that sacrifices must always be made of one for another; a strict observance of the exact meaning of each word makes it impossible to convey the meter and rhyme, but departing too much from meaning for these feels like an abomination.  But sacrificies must me made.  That said, below is my translation, followed by the original: Muse When by mistake I let the pen slip, Missing the inkwell, near the moon see it dip,- To the lake of black nights in its unceasing creep, Is stitched the overgrown inkwell with a dream from the nightingales keep,- Diverse harmonies rush from the pen, An astonishing layer of silver on them, They are like birds, of whose touch I am afraid, But the lines flock together and fill up the page.  I welcome you here, wild-running night, And we have exactly one origin and plight- We are both dark for our doubting eyes, One homeland we share and she never dies.  I remember how you were conquered by day, You remember how I, from the rock, broke away, You ever from the milky paths turn aside, In the cracks of the lines you do love to hide.  Child of a dream, sketched with nightingales hues, Solitary reader, you are my muse.  I see you off, with no thanks for your time, But in a froth of delight, I am brimming with rhyme.  1930, Maria Sergeyevna Petrovykh translated by John Dougherty Continue reading \"Maria Petrovykhs 'Muse\""}}

Fictionalized autobiographical novels, written in the 3rd-person, account for most of his creative work.  His academic writing encompasses reviews, essays, articles, and books on semiotics, film, dance, theater, and opera.  His non-traditional films reveal an engineered penchant for melodrama, love songs, and silent movies; their central topic is homosexuality.  Towards the end of the 2000s, he started organizing concerts en images, events in which he combines silent films, some segments shot by himself for the occasions, with live classical music, and sometimes singing and acting. Eric de Kuyper was born and spent his early childhood in Brussels and then, as he put it, his teenage years of choices swayed by \"faith, sexuality, and the future\" in Antwerp.  According to him, his family mostly spoke Dutch while they \"thought in French and felt the more subtle emotions\" in that language. After graduating from Notre Dame Jesuit High School, he returned to the city of his birth to study in the Department of Audiovisual and Dramatic Arts and Techniques (Rits), Erasmus University College Brussels, and took courses in philosophy and mass communication at the Free University of Brussels. While in college, he began to work as a producer at the Flemish Radio and Television Network.  In 1974 he registered for graduate study at the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences in Paris where he worked in semiotics and from which he received a PhD for his thesis \"Pour une Semiotique Spectaculaire\" under the direction of A.  J.  Greimas in 1979. Before he became a full-time writer in 1992, he was professor of film theory at the Catholic University of Nijmegen in the Netherlands (1978-1988), and then Deputy Director of the Dutch Film Museum (1988-1992).  He was on the editorial board of and contributed to the Dutch academic film journal Versus.  De Kuyper has described himself as belonging to the dying breed of inhabitants of Brussels who are fully bilingual in Dutch (Flemish) and French, he also speaks English and German.  His most frequent coauthor of academic papers and teammate in filmmaking has been another Flemish Belgian and de Kuyper's fellow student at Brussels and Paris, Emile Poppe, later a colleague at Nijmegen University (Poppe's position with the Film Archives eventually associated him with the University of Groningen). They live near Nijmegen in Kranenburg in Germany, about 5 miles (8. 0 km) from the Dutch border, as does the main character of de Kuyper's short story \"De verkeerde krant,\" (\"The Wrong Newspaper\"). De Kuyper has said that he feels at home both in Belgium and the Netherlands to a certain degree, as well as somewhat of a stranger in each of the countries. De Kuyper's first novel (Aan zee: taferelen uit de kinderjaren; By the Sea: Scenes from a Childhood) consists of a series of insightful snapshots of a small boy's life in post-World War II Brussels and family summer vacation at Ostend.  By the Sea can look at the \"No one who has readcan look at the Ostend beach without thinking of de Kuyper. \" Together, they conjure up a nostalgic vignette of times gone by, along with a timeless sense of childhood when one feels everything revolves around him.  A reviewer said of its effective acuteness that no one who has read it can look at the Belgian beach without thinking of de Kuyper. The lyrical By the Sea turned out to be the first volume in de Kuyper's successful series of 3rd-person fictionalized memoirs. In the short story (De verkeerde krant), de Kuyper turns his observations to all things German as a Dutch professor, living in Germany like de Kuyper, takes a train trip to Frankfurt: The ticket inspector came.  Ich bedanke mich, he said politely.  Strange that in German you thank yourself.  For a long time he had pondered why the custom differed so much from that of other languages.  In French, English, and Dutch you thank the other person and not yourself.  Ultimately, he reached the conclusion that it wasn't so much a direct expression of thanks as a form of courtesy in which I declare myself to be thankful.  Of course, you could always just say Danke schon. The traveler's thoughts drift from languages to comparisons of European newspaper styles to cross-cultural observations, while his journey brings him to an unusual chance encounter as he transfers to a connecting train at Cologne. De Kuyper's films reveal an engineered penchant for melodrama, love songs, and silent films of Alfred Machin and Yevgeni Bauer.  The central theme of his filmmaking is homosexuality.  Most of his work is highly experimental underground shown mainly at film festivals. His non-traditional directorial debut (finished 1982, released 1983) earned him the Grand Prix at the Hyeres International Festival of Young Cinema, Different Cinema. Its original Italian title refers to the aria \"Oh, pure/chaste goddess. . . \" (i. e. , the moon) from Norma.  The black-and-white 106'-long feature without a dialogue starts with a stationary camera showing attractive men grooming in front of a mirror while the soundtrack of operatic arias and fragments of other songs challenges the viewer to perceive the two levels as seductive and intoxicating parallels, speculative contrasts, or mold-breaking transgressions. The film establishes a relation with its cinematic objects, male bodies, that is both sensual and distant, somewhat reminiscent of Flesh (dir.  Paul Morrissey; 1968) produced by Andy Warhol. In his most narrative film, de Kuyper explores the themes of melodrama in the context of the characters' selection of lovers, and drives it in with an unconventional ending.  The black-and-white photography is by the legendary Henri Alekan, cinematographer on Beauty and the Beast (dir.  Jean Cocteau, 1946).  The love story between a college student and his 40-year-old professor of film studies (like de Kuyper at the time), specialized in Hollywood dramas, takes an unusual twist when the two decide to visit the student's parents.  The father turns out to be the professor's lover of fifteen years ago. De Kuyper said he considered it important not to allow the audience to read the film through the common expectations of a gay topic, while at the same time, the choice of two male lead characters prevented the deciphering of the topic of love through the commonly established codes.  He intended the balance to bring to the foreground the film's central topic, the exploration of asynchrony at the roots of the Western notion of love. Rather than a discourse about love in people's real lives, though, A Strange Love Affair is filled with discourse about love as found in the movies, particularly Johnny Guitar (dir.  Nicholas Ray, 1954), the controlling metaphor for the whole story. After a decade-long hiatus from film, de Kuyper collaborated with Chantal Akerman on the screenplays for her La captive (The Captive; 2000) and Demain on demenage (Tomorrow We Move; 2004) and she later cast him in a supporting role in her Die Blutgrafin. Eric de Kuyper's fiction has been translated to French, Italian, and Hungarian, one short story to English. Aan zee: taferelen uit de kinderjaren.

It began with studying theatre direction at the IAD and the RITCS Brussels.  Then years later, after being producer (eg.  the experimental filmprogram 'DeAndere Film') at the Flemish Television (BRT), I started at the Univeristy of Brussels studying philosophy and mass- comunciation.  However I did my PhD in Paris, at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes, under prof.  A. J.  Greimas.  The subject of my thesis was called Pour une semiotique spectaculaire and was of course about the performing arts.  Emile Poppe's PhD thesis was called l'Espace spectaculaire and can be seen as a second part.  During our years at the University we teached not only filmtheory (and semiotics!) but also a history of the performing arts.  For our forthcoming book together Theatraliteit (Artez-Lanno, autumn 2013) we reworked a good deal of this material.  And during the holidays we shot some of our first films (Casta Diva, Naughty Boys. . . ) With Emile Poppe I did research for the just recently opened Centre Pompidou on film and architecture.  A selection of this research was published as a special number of VERSUS ('Wonen in Film', 1/1985).  We worked together with the Archives d'Architecture Moderne in Brussels.  During our years in Paris we worked especially within a workshop of architecture.  Communications published 'l'Espace du Seminaire' (n 27/1977) and 'Voir et regarder'(34/1981).  My further work in the fields of film theory and film history - as Alfred Machin, cineaste/filmmaker - was only implicitely semiotic.  However my Verbeelding van het Mannelijk Lichaam (to be published by the University Press of Mississipi) could not have been written without my structuralist background! Eventually I teached for more than ten years at the Katholieke Universiteit Nijmegen, where I created the film and performance studies ('Film en Opvoeringskunsten') with my friend and colleague Emile Poppe.  Later I was guest professor at the Goethe Unversitat Frankfurt, the Universite Libre de Liege, the Vrije Universiteit Utrecht, the Sorbonne Nouvelle, Paris and the Universitat Zurich.  My book Te vroeg, te laat is about my stay in Frankfurt.  More recently I was 'writer in residence' at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel.  During these years I published in French or Dutch many articles on semiotics, filmtheory, etc. . .  With Emile Poppe, I edited the quarterly VERSUS where one can find many of my texts.  I collaborated also regularly to the French magazines Cinematheque, Hors-Cadre, Cinema 00 and Trafic.  In Germany Kintop, Montage/AV and in Italy Cinegrafie published my texts.  For the Storia del Cinema Mondiale (Einaudi, 1991) I wrote about 'art nouveau' in early cinema.  Accompanying the projects Imaginaire en Contexte several texts on this fascinating period of cinema were written. "}}

It was created on November 17, 2011, by decree 1880/2011. It is part of the Secretary of Culture of the national government. The first president was Pacho O'Donnell, working with other historians.  The institute is named after Manuel Dorrego, an Argentine governor of the 19th century who was deposed and executed during the Argentine Civil Wars, but the scope includes as well other national heroes of Argentina, such as Juan Manuel de Rosas and Juan Peron, and Iberoamerican national heroes as Simon Bolivar and Bernardo O'Higgins.  The decree considers that the historiography of Argentina is biased towards the Unitarian Party, as the first historians (such as Bartolome Mitre), and seeks to counter such bias. Several members resigned in 2013, including O'Donnell, who was replaced by Victor Ramos.  Ramos was fired when he voiced his support for Daniel Scioli in the 2015 elections, and the institution was intervened.  The president during the intervention was Carlos Caramello, a close friend of the minister Anibal Fernandez.

For other uses, see Dorrego (disambiguation) Argentine statesman and soldier Manuel Dorrego (11 June 1787 - 13 December 1828) was an Argentine statesman and soldier.  He was governor of Buenos Aires in 1820, and then again from 1827 to 1828. Dorrego was born in Buenos Aires on 11 June 1787 to Jose Antonio do Rego, a Portuguese merchant, and to Maria de la Ascension Salas.  He enrolled in the Real Colegio de San Carlos in 1803, and moved to the Real Universidad de San Felipe in the Captaincy General of Chile to continue his studies.  He supported the early steps of the Chilean War of Independence in 1810, which led to the removal of the Spanish colonial authorities and the establishment of the first Chilean Government Junta. He moved to the United Provinces of the Rio de la Plata (modern Argentina), and joined the Army of the North, under the command of Manuel Belgrano.  He fought in the battles of Tucuman and Salta, being injured in both.  He was sanctioned by Belgrano for promoting a duel.  As a result, he did not take part in the battles of Vilcapugio and Ayohuma, two defeats of the Army of the North, and Belgrano regretted later the absence of Dorrego from them. Dorrego opposed the Luso-Brazilian invasion of the Banda Oriental, encouraged by Juan Martin de Pueyrredon to counter the influence of Jose Gervasio Artigas.  He was exiled by Pueyrredon, and stayed some time in Baltimore (United States). He studied federalism in the United States, and thought that each state of a country should have some autonomy, rejecting the strong centralization into a single government sought by Pueyrredon. During this times he wrote the Cartas apologeticas, criticizing the support of Pueyrredon to the Luso-Brazilian invasion. He returned to Buenos Aires in 1819, following the departure of Pueyrredon.  He was appointed as interim governor, and fought against the armies of Alvear, Carrera and Estanislao Lopez.  Still, he was resisted in the city, and the stable appointment as governor was given to Martin Rodriguez instead.  He was banished again, and moved to Upper Peru.  He met Simon Bolivar in Quito, and supported his ideas of unifying all the continent into a giant federation. Dorrego returned to Buenos Aires a short time afterwards and worked in the legislature of Buenos Aires in the 1826 Constituent Assembly.  He strongly supported a federal system of government and criticized the qualified suffrage.  However, the 1826 Constitution promoted a strong centralized government and qualified suffrage. Execution of Manuel Dorrego.  Dorrego opposed the government of the unitarian Bernardino Rivadavia, who was appointed as the first president of Argentina, and voiced his criticism in the newspaper \"El Tribuno\".  Resisted by all the provinces, Rivadavia resigned as president, and vice president Vicente Lopez y Planes resigned as well.  No longer having a national head of state, the legislature appointed Dorrego as governor of the Buenos Aires province.  He took measures to support the poor, promote a federal organization of the country, and ended the Argentine-Brazilian War. The Argentine troops were discontented with Dorrego because he accepted the conditions imposed by the British diplomacy despite their military victories in the conflict.  Encouraged by the Unitarian party, Juan Lavalle led a coup against Dorrego on 1 December 1828.  Dorrego left the city and organized his forces in the countryside.  He was defeated, and then executed by Lavalle. Lavalle closed the legislature and began a period of political violence against the Federals, but he was defeated and forced to resign by Juan Manuel de Rosas, who restored the institutions that existed before Lavalle's coup.", "article_2": "Is this a pub ?

Upon Rivadavias resignation in 1827, Dorrego was elected governor of Buenos Aires and became the de facto leader of the other Argentine provinces.  He displayed an unusual talent for balancing the demands of both the Unitario and Federalist movements.  Faced with leading the war against Brazil over the future of the Banda Oriental (what is now Uruguay), he signed a peace agreement with Brazil making the province independent.  Portions of the military that supported the Unitarios joined the independence hero, General Juan Galo Lavalle, in challenging Dorregos authority.

For the surname, see Kahlo (surname) Kahlo and the second or maternal family name is Calderon.  In this Spanish name , the first or paternal surname isand the second or maternal family name is Magdalena Carmen Frida Kahlo y Calderon ( Spanish pronunciation: ['frida 'kalo]; 6 July 1907 - 13 July 1954) was a Mexican painter known for her many portraits, self-portraits, and works inspired by the nature and artifacts of Mexico.  Inspired by the country's popular culture, she employed a naive folk art style to explore questions of identity, postcolonialism, gender, class, and race in Mexican society. Her paintings often had strong autobiographical elements and mixed realism with fantasy.  In addition to belonging to the post-revolutionary Mexicayotl movement, which sought to define a Mexican identity, Kahlo has been described as a surrealist or magical realist. She is known for painting about her experience of chronic pain. Born to a German father and a mestiza mother, Kahlo spent most of her childhood and adult life at La Casa Azul, her family home in Coyoacan - now publicly accessible as the Frida Kahlo Museum.  Although she was disabled by polio as a child, Kahlo had been a promising student headed for medical school until being injured in a bus accident at the age of 18, which caused her lifelong pain and medical problems.  During her recovery, she returned to her childhood interest in art with the idea of becoming an artist.  Kahlo's interests in politics and art led her to join the Mexican Communist Party in 1927, through which she met fellow Mexican artist Diego Rivera.  The couple married in 1929 and spent the late 1920s and early 1930s travelling in Mexico and the United States together.  During this time, she developed her artistic style, drawing her main inspiration from Mexican folk culture, and painted mostly small self-portraits that mixed elements from pre-Columbian and Catholic beliefs.  Her paintings raised the interest of Surrealist artist Andre Breton, who arranged for Kahlo's first solo exhibition at the Julien Levy Gallery in New York in 1938; the exhibition was a success and was followed by another in Paris in 1939.  While the French exhibition was less successful, the Louvre purchased a painting from Kahlo, The Frame, making her the first Mexican artist to be featured in their collection. Throughout the 1940s, Kahlo participated in exhibitions in Mexico and the United States and worked as an art teacher.  She taught at the Escuela Nacional de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado (\"La Esmeralda\") and was a founding member of the Seminario de Cultura Mexicana.  Kahlo's always-fragile health began to decline in the same decade.  She had her first solo exhibition in Mexico in 1953, shortly before her death in 1954 at the age of 47.  Kahlo's work as an artist remained relatively unknown until the late 1970s, when her work was rediscovered by art historians and political activists.  By the early 1990s, not only had she become a recognized figure in art history, but she was also regarded as an icon for Chicanos, the feminism movement, and the LGBTQ+ movement.  Kahlo's work has been celebrated internationally as emblematic of Mexican national and indigenous traditions and by feminists for what is seen as its uncompromising depiction of the female experience and form. Artistic career Early career Kahlo on 15 June 1919, aged 11 Kahlo enjoyed art from an early age, receiving drawing instruction from printmaker Fernando Fernandez (who was her father's friend) and filling notebooks with sketches.  In 1925, she began to work outside of school to help her family.  After briefly working as a stenographer, she became a paid engraving apprentice for Fernandez.  He was impressed by her talent, although she did not consider art as a career at this time.  A severe bus accident at the age of 18 left Kahlo in lifelong pain.  Confined to bed for three months following the accident, Kahlo began to paint. She started to consider a career as a medical illustrator, as well, which would combine her interests in science and art.  Her mother provided her with a specially-made easel, which enabled her to paint in bed, and her father lent her some of his oil paints.  She had a mirror placed above the easel, so that she could see herself. Painting became a way for Kahlo to explore questions of identity and existence.  She explained, \"I paint myself because I am often alone and I am the subject I know best. \" She later stated that the accident and the isolating recovery period made her desire \"to begin again, painting things just as [she] saw them with [her] own eyes and nothing more. \" Most of the paintings Kahlo made during this time were portraits of herself, her sisters, and her schoolfriends.  Her early paintings and correspondence show that she drew inspiration especially from European artists, in particular Renaissance masters such as Sandro Botticelli and Bronzino and from avant-garde movements such as Neue Sachlichkeit and Cubism.  On moving to Morelos in 1929 with her husband Rivera, Kahlo was inspired by the city of Cuernavaca where they lived.  She changed her artistic style and increasingly drew inspiration from Mexican folk art.  Art historian Andrea Kettenmann states that she may have been influenced by Adolfo Best Maugard's treatise on the subject, for she incorporated many of the characteristics that he outlined - for example, the lack of perspective and the combining of elements from pre-Columbian and colonial periods of Mexican art.  Her identification with La Raza, the people of Mexico, and her profound interest in its culture remained important facets of her art throughout the rest of her life.  Work in the United States Kahlo in 1926 When Kahlo and Rivera moved to San Francisco in 1930, Kahlo was introduced to American artists such as Edward Weston, Ralph Stackpole, Timothy L.  Pflueger, and Nickolas Muray.  The six months spent in San Francisco were a productive period for Kahlo, who further developed the folk art style she had adopted in Cuernavaca.  In addition to painting portraits of several new acquaintances, she made Frieda and Diego Rivera (1931), a double portrait based on their wedding photograph, and The Portrait of Luther Burbank (1931), which depicted the eponymous horticulturist as a hybrid between a human and a plant.  Although she still publicly presented herself as simply Rivera's spouse rather than as an artist, she participated for the first time in an exhibition, when Frieda and Diego Rivera was included in the Sixth Annual Exhibition of the San Francisco Society of Women Artists in the Palace of the Legion of Honor. On moving to Detroit with Rivera, Kahlo experienced numerous health problems related to a failed pregnancy.  Despite these health problems, as well as her dislike for the capitalist culture of the United States, Kahlo's time in the city was beneficial for her artistic expression.  She experimented with different techniques, such as etching and frescos, and her paintings began to show a stronger narrative style. She also began placing emphasis on the themes of \"terror, suffering, wounds, and pain\".  Despite the popularity of the mural in Mexican art at the time, she adopted a diametrically opposed medium, votive images or retablos, religious paintings made on small metal sheets by amateur artists to thank saints for their blessings during a calamity.  Amongst the works she made in the retablo manner in Detroit are Henry Ford Hospital (1932), My Birth (1932), and Self-Portrait on the Border of Mexico and the United States (1932).  While none of Kahlo's works were featured in exhibitions in Detroit, she gave an interview to the Detroit News on her art; the article was condescendingly titled \"Wife of the Master Mural Painter Gleefully Dabbles in Works of Art\".  Return to Mexico City and international recognition Upon returning to Mexico City in 1934 Kahlo made no new paintings, and only two in the following year, due to health complications.  In 1937 and 1938, however, Kahlo's artistic career was extremely productive, following her divorce and then reconciliation with Rivera.  She painted more \"than she had done in all her eight previous years of marriage\", creating such works as My Nurse and I (1937), Memory, the Heart (1937), Four Inhabitants of Mexico (1938), and What the Water Gave Me (1938).  Although she was still unsure about her work, the National Autonomous University of Mexico exhibited some of her paintings in early 1938.  She made her first significant sale in the summer of 1938 when film star and art collector Edward G.  Robinson purchased four paintings at $200 each.  Even greater recognition followed when French Surrealist Andre Breton visited Rivera in April 1938.  He was impressed by Kahlo, immediately claiming her as a surrealist and describing her work as \"a ribbon around a bomb\".  He not only promised to arrange for her paintings to be exhibited in Paris but also wrote to his friend and art dealer, Julien Levy, who invited her to hold her first solo exhibition at his gallery on the East 57th Street in Manhattan.  In October, Kahlo traveled alone to New York, where her colorful Mexican dress \"caused a sensation\" and made her seen as \"the height of exotica\".  The exhibition opening in November was attended by famous figures such as Georgia O'Keeffe and Clare Boothe Luce and received much positive attention in the press, although many critics adopted a condescending tone in their reviews.  For example, Time wrote that \"Little Frida's pictures . . .  had the daintiness of miniatures, the vivid reds, and yellows of Mexican tradition and the playfully bloody fancy of an unsentimental child\".  Despite the Great Depression, Kahlo sold half of the 25 paintings presented in the exhibition.  She also received commissions from A.  Conger Goodyear, then the president of the MoMA, and Clare Boothe Luce, for whom she painted a portrait of Luce's friend, socialite Dorothy Hale, who had committed suicide by jumping from her apartment building.  During the three months she spent in New York, Kahlo painted very little, instead focusing on enjoying the city to the extent that her fragile health allowed.  She also had several affairs, continuing the one with Nickolas Muray and engaging in ones with Levy and Edgar Kaufmann, Jr.  In January 1939, Kahlo sailed to Paris to follow up on Andre Breton's invitation to stage an exhibition of her work.  When she arrived, she found that he had not cleared her paintings from the customs and no longer even owned a gallery.  With the aid of Marcel Duchamp, she was able to arrange for an exhibition at the Renou et Colle Gallery.  Further problems arose when the gallery refused to show all but two of Kahlo's paintings, considering them too shocking for audiences, and Breton insisted that they be shown alongside photographs by Manuel Alvarez Bravo, pre-Columbian sculptures, 18th- and 19th-century Mexican portraits, and what she considered \"junk\": sugar skulls, toys, and other items he had bought from Mexican markets.  The exhibition opened in March, but received much less attention than she had received in the United States, partly due to the looming Second World War, and made a loss financially, which led Kahlo to cancel a planned exhibition in London.  Regardless, the Louvre purchased The Frame, making her the first Mexican artist to be featured in their collection.  She was also warmly received by other Parisian artists, such as Pablo Picasso and Joan Miro, as well as the fashion world, with designer Elsa Schiaparelli designing a dress inspired by her and Vogue Paris featuring her on its pages.  However, her overall opinion of Paris and the Surrealists remained negative; in a letter to Muray, she called them \"this bunch of coocoo lunatics and very stupid surrealists\" who \"are so crazy 'intellectual' and rotten that I can't even stand them anymore\".  In the United States, Kahlo's paintings continued to raise interest.  In 1941, her works were featured at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston, and, in the following year, she participated in two high-profile exhibitions in New York, the Twentieth-Century Portraits exhibition at the MoMA and the Surrealists' First Papers of Surrealism exhibition.  In 1943, she was included in the Mexican Art Today exhibition at the Philadelphia Museum of Art and Women Artists at Peggy Guggenheim's The Art of This Century gallery in New York.  Kahlo gained more appreciation for her art in Mexico as well.  She became a founding member of the Seminario de Cultura Mexicana, a group of twenty-five artists commissioned by the Ministry of Public Education in 1942 to spread public knowledge of Mexican culture.  As a member, she took part in planning exhibitions and attended a conference on art.  In Mexico City, her paintings were featured in two exhibitions on Mexican art that were staged at the English-language Benjamin Franklin Library in 1943 and 1944.  She was invited to participate in \"Salon de la Flor\", an exhibition presented at the annual flower exposition.  An article by Rivera on Kahlo's art was also published in the journal published by the Seminario de Cultura Mexicana.  In 1943, Kahlo accepted a teaching position at the recently reformed, nationalistic Escuela Nacional de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado \"La Esmeralda. \" She encouraged her students to treat her in an informal and non-hierarchical way and taught them to appreciate Mexican popular culture and folk art and to derive their subjects from the street.  When her health problems made it difficult for her to commute to the school in Mexico City, she began to hold her lessons at La Casa Azul.  Four of her students - Fanny Rabel, Arturo Garcia Bustos, Guillermo Monroy, and Arturo Estrada - became devotees, and were referred to as \"Los Fridos\" for their enthusiasm.  Kahlo secured three mural commissions for herself and her students.  In 1944, they painted La Rosita, a pulqueria in Coyoacan.  In 1945, the government commissioned them to paint murals for a Coyoacan launderette as part of a national scheme to help poor women who made their living as laundresses.  The same year, the group created murals for Posada del Sol, a hotel in Mexico City.  However, it was destroyed soon after completion as the hotel's owner did not like it. [citation needed] Kahlo struggled to make a living from her art until the mid to late 1940s, as she refused to adapt her style to suit her clients' wishes.  She received two commissions from the Mexican government in the early 1940s.  She did not complete the first one, possibly due to her dislike of the subject, and the second commission was rejected by the commissioning body.  Nevertheless, she had regular private clients, such as engineer Eduardo Morillo Safa, who ordered more than thirty portraits of family members over the decade.  Her financial situation improved when she received a 5000-peso national prize for her painting Moses (1945) in 1946 and when The Two Fridas was purchased by the Museo de Arte Moderno in 1947.  According to art historian Andrea Kettenmann, by the mid-1940s, her paintings were \"featured in the majority of group exhibitions in Mexico\".  Further, Martha Zamora wrote that she could \"sell whatever she was currently painting; sometimes incomplete pictures were purchased right off the easel\".  Later years Even as Kahlo was gaining recognition in Mexico, her health was declining rapidly, and an attempted surgery to support her spine failed.  Her paintings from this period include Broken Column (1944), Without Hope (1945), Tree of Hope, Stand Fast (1946), and The Wounded Deer (1946), reflecting her poor physical state.  During her last years, Kahlo was mostly confined to the Casa Azul.  She painted mostly still lifes, portraying fruit and flowers with political symbols such as flags or doves.  She was concerned about being able to portray her political convictions, stating that \"I have a great restlessness about my paintings.  Mainly because I want to make it useful to the revolutionary communist movement. . .  until now I have managed simply an honest expression of my own self . . .  I must struggle with all my strength to ensure that the little positive my health allows me to do also benefits the Revolution, the only real reason to live. \" She also altered her painting style: her brushstrokes, previously delicate and careful, were now hastier, her use of color more brash, and the overall style more intense and feverish.  Photographer Lola Alvarez Bravo understood that Kahlo did not have much longer to live, and thus staged her first solo exhibition in Mexico at the Galeria Arte Contemporaneo in April 1953.  Though Kahlo was initially not due to attend the opening, as her doctors had prescribed bed rest for her, she ordered her four-poster bed to be moved from her home to the gallery.  To the surprise of the guests, she arrived in an ambulance and was carried on a stretcher to the bed, where she stayed for the duration of the party.  The exhibition was a notable cultural event in Mexico and also received attention in mainstream press around the world.  The same year, the Tate Gallery's exhibition on Mexican art in London featured five of her paintings.  In 1954, Kahlo was again hospitalized in April and May.  That spring, she resumed painting after a one-year interval.  Her last paintings include the political Marxism Will Give Health to the Sick (c.  1954) and Frida and Stalin (c.  1954) and the still-life Viva La Vida (1954).  Style and influences Estimates vary on how many paintings Kahlo made during her life, with figures ranging from fewer than 150 to around 200. Her earliest paintings, which she made in the mid-1920s, show influence from Renaissance masters and European avant-garde artists such as Amedeo Modigliani.  Towards the end of the decade, Kahlo derived more inspiration from Mexican folk art, drawn to its elements of \"fantasy, naivety, and fascination with violence and death\". The style she developed mixed reality with surrealistic elements and often depicted pain and death. One of Kahlo's earliest champions was Surrealist artist Andre Breton, who claimed her as part of the movement as an artist who had supposedly developed her style \"in total ignorance of the ideas that motivated the activities of my friends and myself\".  This was echoed by Bertram D.  Wolfe, who wrote that Kahlo's was a \"sort of 'naive' Surrealism, which she invented for herself\".  Although Breton regarded her as mostly a feminine force within the Surrealist movement, Kahlo brought postcolonial questions and themes to the forefront of her brand of Surrealism.  Breton also described Kahlo's work as \"wonderfully situated at the point of intersection between the political (philosophical) line and the artistic line\". While she subsequently participated in Surrealist exhibitions, she stated that she \"detest[ed] Surrealism\", which to her was \"bourgeois art\" and not \"true art that the people hope from the artist\".  Some art historians have disagreed whether her work should be classified as belonging to the movement at all.  According to Andrea Kettenmann, Kahlo was a symbolist concerned more in portraying her inner experiences.  Emma Dexter has argued that, as Kahlo derived her mix of fantasy and reality mainly from Aztec mythology and Mexican culture instead of Surrealism, it is more appropriate to consider her paintings as having more in common with magical realism, also known as New Objectivity.  It combined reality and fantasy and employed similar style to Kahlo's, such as flattened perspective, clearly outlined characters and bright colours.  Mexicanidad Similarly to many other contemporary Mexican artists, Kahlo was heavily influenced by Mexicanidad, a romantic nationalism that had developed in the aftermath of the revolution. The Mexicanidad movement claimed to resist the \"mindset of cultural inferiority\" created by colonialism, and placed special importance on indigenous cultures.  Before the revolution, Mexican folk culture - a mixture of indigenous and European elements - was disparaged by the elite, who claimed to have purely European ancestry and regarded Europe as the definition of civilization which Mexico should imitate.  Kahlo's artistic ambition was to paint for the Mexican people, and she stated that she wished \"to be worthy, with my paintings, of the people to whom I belong and to the ideas which strengthen me\".  To enforce this image, she preferred to conceal the education she had received in art from her father and Ferdinand Fernandez and at the preparatory school.  Instead, she cultivated an image of herself as a \"self-taught and naive artist\".  When Kahlo began her career as an artist in the 1920s, muralists dominated the Mexican art scene.  They created large public pieces in the vein of Renaissance masters and Russian socialist realists: they usually depicted masses of people, and their political messages were easy to decipher.  Although she was close to muralists such as Rivera, Jose Clemente Orozco and David Alfaro Siquieros and shared their commitment to socialism and Mexican nationalism, the majority of Kahlo's paintings were self-portraits of relatively small size. Particularly in the 1930s, her style was especially indebted to votive paintings or retablos, which were postcard-sized religious images made by amateur artists.  Their purpose was to thank saints for their protection during a calamity, and they normally depicted an event, such as an illness or an accident, from which its commissioner had been saved.  The focus was on the figures depicted, and they seldom featured a realistic perspective or detailed background, thus distilling the event to its essentials.  Kahlo had an extensive collection of approximately 2,000 retablos, which she displayed on the walls of La Casa Azul.  According to Laura Mulvey and Peter Wollen, the retablo format enabled Kahlo to \"develop the limits of the purely iconic and allowed her to use narrative and allegory\".  Many of Kahlo's self-portraits mimic the classic bust-length portraits that were fashionable during the colonial era, but they subverted the format by depicting their subject as less attractive than in reality.  She concentrated more frequently on this format towards the end of the 1930s, thus reflecting changes in Mexican society.  Increasingly disillusioned by the legacy of the revolution and struggling to cope with the effects of the Great Depression, Mexicans were abandoning the ethos of socialism for individualism.  This was reflected by the \"personality cults\", which developed around Mexican film stars such as Dolores del Rio.  According to Schaefer, Kahlo's \"mask-like self-portraits echo the contemporaneous fascination with the cinematic close-up of feminine beauty, as well as the mystique of female otherness expressed in film noir. \" By always repeating the same facial features, Kahlo drew from the depiction of goddesses and saints in indigenous and Catholic cultures.  Out of specific Mexican folk artists, Kahlo was especially influenced by Hermenegildo Bustos, whose works portrayed Mexican culture and peasant life, and Jose Guadalupe Posada, who depicted accidents and crime in satiric manner.  She also derived inspiration from the works of Hieronymus Bosch, whom she called a \"man of genius\", and Pieter Bruegel the Elder, whose focus on peasant life was similar to her own interest in the Mexican people.  Another influence was the poet Rosario Castellanos, whose poems often chronicle a woman's lot in the patriarchal Mexican society, a concern with the female body, and tell stories of immense physical and emotional pain.  Symbolism and iconography Kahlo's paintings often feature root imagery, with roots growing out of her body to tie her to the ground.  This reflects in a positive sense the theme of personal growth; in a negative sense of being trapped in a particular place, time and situation; and in an ambiguous sense of how memories of the past influence the present for good and/or ill.  In My Grandparents and I, Kahlo painted herself as a ten-year old, holding a ribbon that grows from an ancient tree that bears the portraits of her grandparents and other ancestors while her left foot is a tree trunk growing out of the ground, reflecting Kahlo's view of humanity's unity with the earth and her own sense of unity with Mexico.  In Kahlo's paintings, trees serve as symbols of hope, of strength and of a continuity that transcends generations.  Additionally, hair features as a symbol of growth and of the feminine in Kahlo's paintings and in Self-Portrait with Cropped Hair, Kahlo painted herself wearing a man's suit and shorn of her long hair, which she had just cut off.  Kahlo holds the scissors with one hand menacingly close to her genitals, which can be interpreted as a threat to Rivera - whose frequent unfaithfulness infuriated her - and/or a threat to harm her own body like she has attacked her own hair, a sign of the way that women often project their fury against others onto themselves.  Moreover, the picture reflects Kahlo's frustration not only with Rivera, but also her unease with the patriarchal values of Mexico as the scissors symbolize a malevolent sense of masculinity that threatens to \"cut up\" women, both metaphorically and literally.  In Mexico, the traditional Spanish values of machismo were widely embraced, but Kahlo was always uncomfortable with machismo.  As she suffered for the rest of her life from the bus accident in her youth, Kahlo spent much of her life in hospitals and undergoing surgery, much of it performed by quacks who Kahlo believed could restore her back to where she had been before the accident.  Many of Kahlo's paintings are concerned with medical imagery, which is presented in terms of pain and hurt, featuring Kahlo bleeding and displaying her open wounds.  Many of Kahlo's medical paintings, especially dealing with childbirth and miscarriage, have a strong sense of guilt, of a sense of living one's life at the expense of another who has died so one might live.  Although Kahlo featured herself and events from her life in her paintings, they were often ambiguous in meaning.  She did not use them only to show her subjective experience but to raise questions about Mexican society and the construction of identity within it, particularly gender, race, and social class.  Historian Liza Bakewell has stated that Kahlo \"recognized the conflicts brought on by revolutionary ideology\": What was it to be a Mexican? - modern, yet pre-Columbian; young, yet old; anti-Catholic yet Catholic; Western, yet New World; developing, yet underdeveloped; independent, yet colonized; mestizo, yet not Spanish nor Indian.  To explore these questions through her art, Kahlo developed a complex iconography, extensively employing pre-Columbian and Christian symbols and mythology in her paintings.  In most of her self-portraits, she depicts her face as mask-like, but surrounded by visual cues which allow the viewer to decipher deeper meanings for it.  Aztec mythology features heavily in Kahlo's paintings in symbols including monkeys, skeletons, skulls, blood, and hearts; often, these symbols referred to the myths of Coatlicue, Quetzalcoatl, and Xolotl.  Other central elements that Kahlo derived from Aztec mythology were hybridity and dualism.  Many of her paintings depict opposites: life and death, pre-modernity and modernity, Mexican and European, male and female.  In addition to Aztec legends, Kahlo frequently depicted two central female figures from Mexican folklore in her paintings: La Llorona and La Malinche as interlinked to the hard situations, the suffering, misfortune or judgement, as being calamitous, wretched or being \"de la chingada\".  For example, when she painted herself following her miscarriage in Detroit in Henry Ford Hospital (1932), she shows herself as weeping, with dishevelled hair and an exposed heart, which are all considered part of the appearance of La Llorona, a woman who murdered her children.  The painting was traditionally interpreted as simply a depiction of Kahlo's grief and pain over her failed pregnancies.  But with the interpretation of the symbols in the painting and the information of Kahlo's actual views towards motherhood from her correspondence, the painting has been seen as depicting the unconventional and taboo choice of a woman remaining childless in Mexican society. [citation needed] Kahlo often featured her own body in her paintings, presenting it in varying states and disguises: as wounded, broken, as a child, or clothed in different outfits, such as the Tehuana costume, a man's suit, or a European dress.  She used her body as a metaphor to explore questions on societal roles.  Her paintings often depicted the female body in an unconventional manner, such as during miscarriages, and childbirth or cross-dressing.  In depicting the female body in graphic manner, Kahlo positioned the viewer in the role of the voyeur, \"making it virtually impossible for a viewer not to assume a consciously held position in response\".  According to Nancy Cooey, Kahlo made herself through her paintings into \"the main character of her own mythology, as a woman, as a Mexican, and as a suffering person . . .  She knew how to convert each into a symbol or sign capable of expressing the enormous spiritual resistance of humanity and its splendid sexuality\".  Similarly, Nancy Deffebach has stated that Kahlo \"created herself as a subject who was female, Mexican, modern, and powerful\", and who diverged from the usual dichotomy of roles of mother/whore allowed to women in Mexican society.  Due to her gender and divergence from the muralist tradition, Kahlo's paintings were treated as less political and more naive and subjective than those of her male counterparts up until the late 1980s.  According to art historian Joan Borsa, the critical reception of her exploration of subjectivity and personal history has all too frequently denied or de-emphasized the politics involved in examining one's own location, inheritances and social conditions . . .  Critical responses continue to gloss over Kahlo's reworking of the personal, ignoring or minimizing her interrogation of sexuality, sexual difference, marginality, cultural identity, female subjectivity, politics and power.  Personal life 1907-1924: Family and childhood Kahlo (on the right) and her sisters Cristina , Matilde, and Adriana, photographed by their father, 1916 Magdalena Carmen Frida Kahlo y Calderon[a] was born on 6 July 1907 in Coyoacan, a village on the outskirts of Mexico City. Kahlo stated that she was born at the family home, La Casa Azul (The Blue House), but according to the official birth registry, the birth took place at the nearby home of her maternal grandmother.  Kahlo's parents were photographer Guillermo Kahlo (1871-1941) and Matilde Calderon y Gonzalez (1876-1932), and they were thirty-six and thirty, respectively, when they had her. Originally from Germany, Guillermo had immigrated to Mexico in 1891, after epilepsy caused by an accident ended his university studies.  Although Kahlo said her father was Jewish and her paternal grandparents were Jews from the city of Arad, this claim was challenged in 2006 by a pair of German genealogists who found he was instead a Lutheran. Matilde was born in Oaxaca to an Indigenous father and a mother of Spanish descent.  In addition to Kahlo, the marriage produced daughters Matilde (c.  1898-1951), Adriana (c.  1902-1968), and Cristina (c.  1908-1964).  She had two half-sisters from Guillermo's first marriage, Maria Luisa and Margarita, but they were raised in a convent.  Kahlo later described the atmosphere in her childhood home as often \"very, very sad\".  Both parents were often sick, and their marriage was devoid of love.  Her relationship with her mother, Matilde, was extremely tense.  Kahlo described her mother as \"kind, active and intelligent, but also calculating, cruel and fanatically religious\".  Her father Guillermo's photography business suffered greatly during the Mexican Revolution, as the overthrown government had commissioned works from him, and the long civil war limited the number of private clients.  When Kahlo was six years old, she contracted polio, which eventually made her right leg grow shorter and thinner than the left. [b] The illness forced her to be isolated from her peers for months, and she was bullied.  While the experience made her reclusive, it made her Guillermo's favorite due to their shared experience of living with disability.  Kahlo credited him for making her childhood \"marvelous . . .  he was an immense example to me of tenderness, of work (photographer and also painter), and above all in understanding for all my problems. \" He taught her about literature, nature, and philosophy, and encouraged her to play sports to regain her strength, despite the fact that most physical exercise was seen as unsuitable for girls.  He also taught her photography, and she began to help him retouch, develop, and color photographs.  Due to polio, Kahlo began school later than her peers.  Along with her younger sister Cristina, she attended the local kindergarten and primary school in Coyoacan and was homeschooled for the fifth and sixth grades.  While Cristina followed their sisters into a convent school, Kahlo was enrolled in a German school due to their father's wishes.  She was soon expelled for disobedience and was sent to a vocational teachers school.  Her stay at the school was brief, as she was sexually abused by a female teacher.  In 1922, Kahlo was accepted to the elite National Preparatory School, where she focused on natural sciences with the aim of becoming a physician.  The institution had only recently begun admitting women, with only 35 girls out of 2,000 students.  She performed well academically, was a voracious reader, and became \"deeply immersed and seriously committed to Mexican culture, political activism and issues of social justice\".  The school promoted indigenismo, a new sense of Mexican identity that took pride in the country's indigenous heritage and sought to rid itself of the colonial mindset of Europe as superior to Mexico.  Particularly influential to Kahlo at this time were nine of her schoolmates, with whom she formed an informal group called the \"Cachuchas\" - many of them would become leading figures of the Mexican intellectual elite.  They were rebellious and against everything conservative and pulled pranks, staged plays, and debated philosophy and Russian classics.  To mask the fact that she was older and to declare herself a \"daughter of the revolution\", she began saying that she had been born on 7 July 1910, the year the Mexican Revolution began, which she continued throughout her life.  She fell in love with Alejandro Gomez Arias, the leader of the group and her first love.  Her parents did not approve of the relationship.  Arias and Kahlo were often separated from each other, due to the political instability and violence of the period, so they exchanged passionate love letters. 1925-1930: Bus accident and marriage to Diego Rivera Kahlo photographed by her father in 1926 On 17 September 1925, Kahlo and her boyfriend, Arias, were on their way home from school.  They boarded one bus, but they got off the bus to look for an umbrella that Kahlo had left behind.  They then boarded a second bus, which was crowded, and they sat in the back.  The driver attempted to pass an oncoming electric streetcar.  The streetcar crashed into the side of the wooden bus, dragging it a few feet.  Several passengers were killed in the accident.  While Arias suffered minor injuries, Frida was impaled with an iron handrail that went through her pelvis.  She later described the injury as \"the way a sword pierces a bull\".  The handrail was removed by Arias and others, which was incredibly painful for Kahlo. Kahlo suffered many injuries: her pelvic bone had been fractured, her abdomen and uterus had been punctured by the rail, her spine was broken in three places, her right leg was broken in eleven places, her right foot was crushed and dislocated, her collarbone was broken, and her shoulder was dislocated. She spent a month in hospital and two months recovering at home before being able to return to work. As she continued to experience fatigue and back pain, her doctors ordered X-rays, which revealed that the accident had also displaced three vertebrae.  As treatment she had to wear a plaster corset which confined her to bed rest for the better part of three months.  The accident ended Kahlo's dreams of becoming a physician and caused her pain and illness for the rest of her life; her friend Andres Henestrosa stated that Kahlo \"lived dying\".  Kahlo's bed rest was over by late 1927, and she began socializing with her old schoolfriends, who were now at university and involved in student politics.  She joined the Mexican Communist Party (PCM) and was introduced to a circle of political activists and artists, including the exiled Cuban communist Julio Antonio Mella and the Italian-American photographer Tina Modotti.  At one of Modotti's parties in June 1928, Kahlo was introduced to Diego Rivera.  They had met briefly in 1922 when he was painting a mural at her school.  Shortly after their introduction in 1928, Kahlo asked him to judge whether her paintings showed enough talent for her to pursue a career as an artist.  Rivera recalled being impressed by her works, stating that they showed \"an unusual energy of expression, precise delineation of character, and true severity . . .  They had a fundamental plastic honesty, and an artistic personality of their own . . .  It was obvious to me that this girl was an authentic artist\".  Kahlo soon began a relationship with Rivera, who was 20 years her senior and had two common-law wives.  Kahlo and Rivera were married in a civil ceremony at the town hall of Coyoacan on 21 August 1929.  Her mother opposed the marriage, and both parents referred to it as a \"marriage between an elephant and a dove\", referring to the couple's differences in size; Rivera was tall and overweight while Kahlo was petite and fragile.  Regardless, her father approved of Rivera, who was wealthy and therefore able to support Kahlo, who could not work and had to receive expensive medical treatment.  The wedding was reported by the Mexican and international press, and the marriage was subject to constant media attention in Mexico in the following years, with articles referring to the couple as simply \"Diego and Frida\".  Soon after the marriage, in late 1929, Kahlo and Rivera moved to Cuernavaca in the rural state of Morelos, where he had been commissioned to paint murals for the Palace of Cortes.  Around the same time, she resigned her membership of the PCM in support of Rivera, who had been expelled shortly before the marriage for his support of the leftist opposition movement within the Third International.  During the civil war Morelos had seen some of the heaviest fighting, and life in the Spanish-style city of Cuernavaca sharpened Kahlo's sense of a Mexican identity and history.  Similar to many other Mexican women artists and intellectuals at the time, Kahlo began wearing traditional indigenous Mexican peasant clothing to emphasize her mestiza ancestry: long and colorful skirts, huipils and rebozos, elaborate headdresses and masses of jewelry.  She especially favored the dress of women from the allegedly matriarchal society of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, who had come to represent \"an authentic and indigenous Mexican cultural heritage\" in post-revolutionary Mexico.  The Tehuana outfit allowed Kahlo to express her feminist and anti-colonialist ideals.  1931-1933: Travels in the United States Frida photographed in 1932 by her father, Guillermo After Rivera had completed the commission in Cuernavaca in late 1930, he and Kahlo moved to San Francisco, where he painted murals for the Luncheon Club of the San Francisco Stock Exchange and the California School of Fine Arts.  The couple was \"feted, lionized, [and] spoiled\" by influential collectors and clients during their stay in the city.  Her long love affair with Hungarian-American photographer Nickolas Muray most likely began around this time.  Kahlo and Rivera returned to Mexico for the summer of 1931, and in the fall traveled to New York City for the opening of Rivera's retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA).  In April 1932, they headed to Detroit, where Rivera had been commissioned to paint murals for the Detroit Institute of Arts.  By this time, Kahlo had become bolder in her interactions with the press, impressing journalists with her fluency in English and stating on her arrival to the city that she was the greater artist of the two of them.  \"Of course he [Rivera] does well for a little boy, but it is I who am the big artist\" Frida Kahlo in interview with the Detroit News, 2 February 1933. The year spent in Detroit was a difficult time for Kahlo.  Although she had enjoyed visiting San Francisco and New York City, she disliked aspects of American society, which she regarded as colonialist, as well as most Americans, whom she found \"boring\".  She disliked having to socialize with capitalists such as Henry and Edsel Ford, and was angered that many of the hotels in Detroit refused to accept Jewish guests.  In a letter to a friend, she wrote that \"although I am very interested in all the industrial and mechanical development of the United States\", she felt \"a bit of a rage against all the rich guys here, since I have seen thousands of people in the most terrible misery without anything to eat and with no place to sleep, that is what has most impressed me here, it is terrifying to see the rich having parties day and night whiles thousands and thousands of people are dying of hunger. \" Kahlo's time in Detroit was also complicated by a pregnancy.  Her doctor agreed to perform an abortion, but the medication used was ineffective.  Kahlo was deeply ambivalent about having a child and had already undergone an abortion earlier in her marriage to Rivera.  Following the failed abortion, she reluctantly agreed to continue with the pregnancy, but miscarried in July, which caused a serious hemorrhage that required her being hospitalized for two weeks.  Less than three months later, her mother died from complications of surgery in Mexico.  Kahlo and Rivera returned to New York in March 1933, for he had been commissioned to paint a mural for the Rockefeller Center.  During this time, she only worked on one painting, My Dress Hangs There (1934).  She also gave further interviews to the American press.  In May, Rivera was fired from the Rockefeller Center project and was instead hired to paint a mural for the New Workers School.  Although Rivera wished to continue their stay in the United States, Kahlo was homesick, and they returned to Mexico soon after the mural's unveiling in December 1933.  1934-1949: La Casa Azul and declining health Kahlo and Rivera's houses in San Angel ; they lived there from 1934 until their divorce in 1939, after which it became his studio Back in Mexico City, Kahlo and Rivera moved into a new house in the wealthy neighborhood of San Angel.  Commissioned from Le Corbusier's student Juan O'Gorman, it consisted of two sections joined by a bridge; Kahlo's was painted blue and Rivera's pink and white.  The bohemian residence became an important meeting place for artists and political activists from Mexico and abroad.  Kahlo once again experienced health problems - undergoing an appendectomy, two abortions, and the amputation of gangrenous toes - and her marriage to Rivera had become strained.  He was not happy to be back in Mexico and blamed Kahlo for their return.  While he had been unfaithful to her before, he now embarked on an affair with her younger sister Cristina, which deeply hurt Kahlo's feelings.  After discovering the affair in early 1935, she moved to an apartment in central Mexico City and considered divorcing him.  She also had an affair of her own with American artist Isamu Noguchi.  Kahlo was reconciled with Rivera and Cristina later in 1935 and moved back to San Angel.  She became a loving aunt to Cristina's children, Isolda and Antonio.  Despite the reconciliation, both Rivera and Kahlo continued their infidelities.  She also resumed her political activities in 1936, joining the Fourth International and becoming a founding member of a solidarity committee to provide aid to the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War.  She and Rivera successfully petitioned the Mexican government to grant asylum to former Soviet leader Leon Trotsky and offered La Casa Azul for him and his wife Natalia Sedova as a residence.  The couple lived there from January 1937 until April 1939, with Kahlo and Trotsky not only becoming good friends but also having a brief affair.  Vogue 1937 photograph by Toni Frissell , from a fashion shoot for After opening an exhibition in Paris, Kahlo sailed back to New York.  She was eager to be reunited with Muray, but he decided to end their affair, as he had met another woman whom he was planning to marry.  Kahlo traveled back to Mexico City, where Rivera requested a divorce from her.  The exact reasons for his decision are unknown, but he stated publicly that it was merely a \"matter of legal convenience in the style of modern times . . .  there are no sentimental, artistic, or economic reasons\".  According to their friends, the divorce was mainly caused by their mutual infidelities.  He and Kahlo were granted a divorce in November 1939, but remained friendly; she continued to manage his finances and correspondence.  La Casa Azul , Kahlo's childhood home and residence from 1939 until her death in 1954 The garden at La Casa Azul Following her separation from Rivera, Kahlo moved back to La Casa Azul and, determined to earn her own living, began another productive period as an artist, inspired by her experiences abroad.  Encouraged by the recognition she was gaining, she moved from using the small and more intimate tin sheets she had used since 1932 to large canvases, as they were easier to exhibit.  She also adopted a more sophisticated technique, limited the graphic details, and began to produce more quarter-length portraits, which were easier to sell.  She painted several of her most famous pieces during this period, such as The Two Fridas (1939), Self-portrait with Cropped Hair (1940), The Wounded Table (1940), and Self-Portrait with Thorn Necklace and Hummingbird (1940).  Three exhibitions featured her works in 1940: the fourth International Surrealist Exhibition in Mexico City, the Golden Gate International Exposition in San Francisco, and Twenty Centuries of Mexican Art in MoMA in New York. On 21 August 1940, Trotsky was assassinated in Coyoacan, where he had continued to live after leaving La Casa Azul.  Kahlo was briefly suspected of being involved, as she knew the murderer, and was arrested and held for two days with her sister Cristina.  The following month, Kahlo traveled to San Francisco for medical treatment for back pain and a fungal infection on her hand.  Her continuously fragile health had increasingly declined since her divorce and was exacerbated by her heavy consumption of alcohol.  Rivera was also in San Francisco after he fled Mexico City following Trotsky's murder and accepted a commission.  Although Kahlo had a relationship with art dealer Heinz Berggruen during her visit to San Francisco, she and Rivera were reconciled.  They remarried in a simple civil ceremony on 8 December 1940.  Kahlo and Rivera returned to Mexico soon after their wedding.  The union was less turbulent than before for its first five years.  Both were more independent, and while La Casa Azul was their primary residence, Rivera retained the San Angel house for use as his studio and second apartment.  Both continued having extramarital affairs; Kahlo, being bisexual, had affairs with both men and women, with evidence suggesting her male lovers were more important to Kahlo than her female lovers. Despite the medical treatment she had received in San Francisco, Kahlo's health problems continued throughout the 1940s.  Due to her spinal problems, she wore twenty-eight separate supportive corsets, varying from steel and leather to plaster, between 1940 and 1954.  She experienced pain in her legs, the infection on her hand had become chronic, and she was also treated for syphilis.  The death of her father in April 1941 plunged her into a depression.  Her ill health made her increasingly confined to La Casa Azul, which became the center of her world.  She enjoyed taking care of the house and its garden, and was kept company by friends, servants, and various pets, including spider monkeys, Xoloitzcuintlis, and parrots.  Kahlo (centre), Nayantara Sahgal (right) and Rita Dar at Casa Azul in 1947 While Kahlo was gaining recognition in her home country, her health continued to decline.  By the mid-1940s, her back had worsened to the point that she could no longer sit or stand continuously.  In June 1945, she traveled to New York for an operation which fused a bone graft and a steel support to her spine to straighten it.  The difficult operation was a failure.  According to Herrera, Kahlo also sabotaged her recovery by not resting as required and by once physically re-opening her wounds in a fit of anger.  Her paintings from this period, such as The Broken Column (1944), Without Hope (1945), Tree of Hope, Stand Fast (1946), and The Wounded Deer (1946), reflect her declining health.  1950-1954: Last years and death Kahlo's wheelchair and adjustable easel in La Casa Azul, with one of her still lifes from her final years In 1950, Kahlo spent most of the year in Hospital ABC in Mexico City, where she underwent a new bone graft surgery on her spine.  It caused a difficult infection and necessitated several follow-up surgeries.  After being discharged, she was mostly confined to La Casa Azul, using a wheelchair and crutches to be ambulatory.  During these final years of her life, Kahlo dedicated her time to political causes to the extent that her health allowed.  She had rejoined the Mexican Communist Party in 1948 and campaigned for peace, for example, by collecting signatures for the Stockholm Appeal.  Kahlo's right leg was amputated at the knee due to gangrene in August 1953.  She became severely depressed and anxious, and her dependency on painkillers escalated.  When Rivera began yet another affair, she attempted suicide by overdose.  She wrote in her diary in February 1954, \"They amputated my leg six months ago, they have given me centuries of torture and at moments I almost lost my reason.  I keep on wanting to kill myself.  Diego is what keeps me from it, through my vain idea that he would miss me.  . . .  But never in my life have I suffered more.  I will wait a while. . . \" Kahlo's death mask on her bed in La Casa Azul In her last days, Kahlo was mostly bedridden with bronchopneumonia, though she made a public appearance on 2 July 1954, participating with Rivera in a demonstration against the CIA invasion of Guatemala.  She seemed to anticipate her death, as she spoke about it to visitors and drew skeletons and angels in her diary.  The last drawing was a black angel, which biographer Hayden Herrera interprets as the Angel of Death.  It was accompanied by the last words she wrote, \"I joyfully await the exit - and I hope never to return - Frida\" (\"Espero Alegre la Salida - y Espero no Volver jamas\").  The demonstration worsened her illness, and on the night of 12 July 1954, Kahlo had a high fever and was in extreme pain.  At approximately 6 a. m.  on 13 July 1954, her nurse found her dead in her bed.  Kahlo was 47 years old.  The official cause of death was pulmonary embolism, although no autopsy was performed.  Herrera has argued that Kahlo, in fact, committed suicide. The nurse, who counted Kahlo's painkillers to monitor her drug use, stated that Kahlo had taken an overdose the night she died.  She had been prescribed a maximum dose of seven pills but had taken eleven.  She had also given Rivera a wedding anniversary present that evening, over a month in advance.  On the evening of 13 July, Kahlo's body was taken to the Palacio de Bellas Artes, where it lay in state under a Communist flag.  The following day, it was carried to the Panteon Civil de Dolores, where friends and family attended an informal funeral ceremony.  Hundreds of admirers stood outside.  In accordance with her wishes, Kahlo was cremated.  Rivera, who stated that her death was \"the most tragic day of my life\", died three years later, in 1957.  Kahlo's ashes are displayed in a pre-Columbian urn at La Casa Azul, which opened as a museum in 1958.  Posthumous recognition and \"Fridamania\" \"The twenty-first-century Frida is both a star - a commercial property complete with fan clubs and merchandising - and an embodiment of the hopes and aspirations of a near-religious group of followers.  This wild, hybrid Frida, a mixture of tragic bohemian, Virgin of Guadalupe, revolutionary heroine and Salma Hayek, has taken such great hold on the public imagination that it tends to obscure the historically retrievable Kahlo. \" - Art historian Oriana Baddeley on Kahlo The Tate Modern considers Kahlo \"one of the most significant artists of the twentieth century\", while according to art historian Elizabeth Bakewell, she is \"one of Mexico's most important twentieth-century figures\".  Kahlo's reputation as an artist developed late in her life and grew even further posthumously, as during her lifetime she was primarily known as the wife of Diego Rivera and as an eccentric personality among the international cultural elite.  She gradually gained more recognition in the late 1970s when feminist scholars began to question the exclusion of female and non-Western artists from the art historical canon and the Chicano Movement lifted her as one of their icons. The first two books about Kahlo were published in Mexico by Teresa del Conde and Raquel Tibol in 1976 and 1977, respectively, and, in 1977, The Tree of Hope Stands Firm (1944) became the first Kahlo painting to be sold in an auction, netting $19,000 at Sotheby's.  These milestones were followed by the first two retrospectives staged on Kahlo's oeuvre in 1978, one at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City and another at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago.  Two events were instrumental in raising interest in her life and art for the general public outside Mexico.  The first was a joint retrospective of her paintings and Tina Modotti's photographs at the Whitechapel Gallery in London, which was curated and organized by Peter Wollen and Laura Mulvey.  It opened in May 1982, and later traveled to Sweden, Germany, the United States, and Mexico.  The second was the publication of art historian Hayden Herrera's international bestseller Frida: A Biography of Frida Kahlo in 1983. By 1984, Kahlo's reputation as an artist had grown to such extent that Mexico declared her works part of the national cultural heritage, prohibiting their export from the country. As a result, her paintings seldom appear in international auctions, and comprehensive retrospectives are rare. Regardless, her paintings have still broken records for Latin American art in the 1990s and 2000s.  In 1990, she became the first Latin American artist to break the one-million-dollar threshold when Diego and I was auctioned by Sotheby's for $1,430,000.  In 2006, Roots (1943) reached US$5. 6 million, and in 2016, Two Lovers in a Forest (1939) sold for $8 million. Kahlo has attracted popular interest to the extent that the term \"Fridamania\" has been coined to describe the phenomenon.  She is considered \"one of the most instantly recognizable artists\", whose face has been \"used with the same regularity, and often with a shared symbolism, as images of Che Guevara or Bob Marley\".  Her life and art have inspired a variety of merchandise, and her distinctive look has been appropriated by the fashion world. A Hollywood biopic, Julie Taymor's Frida, was released in 2002. Based on Herrera's biography and starring Salma Hayek (who co-produced the film) as Kahlo, it grossed US$56 million worldwide and earned six Academy Award nominations, winning for Best Makeup and Best Original Score. The 2017 Disney-Pixar animation Coco also features Kahlo in a supporting role, voiced by Natalia Cordova-Buckley. Kahlo's popular appeal is seen to stem first and foremost from a fascination with her life story, especially its painful and tragic aspects.  She has become an icon for several minority groups and political movements, such as feminists, the LGBTQ community, and Chicanos.  Oriana Baddeley has written that Kahlo has become a signifier of non-conformity and \"the archetype of a cultural minority\", who is regarded simultaneously as \"a victim, crippled and abused\" and as \"a survivor who fights back\".  Edward Sullivan stated that Kahlo is hailed as a hero by so many because she is \"someone to validate their own struggle to find their own voice and their own public personalities\".  According to John Berger, Kahlo's popularity is partly due to the fact that \"the sharing of pain is one of the essential preconditions for a refinding of dignity and hope\" in twenty-first century society.  Kirk Varnedoe, the former chief curator of MoMA, has stated that Kahlo's posthumous success is linked to the way in which \"she clicks with today's sensibilities - her psycho-obsessive concern with herself, her creation of a personal alternative world carries a voltage.  Her constant remaking of her identity, her construction of a theater of the self are exactly what preoccupy such contemporary artists as Cindy Sherman or Kiki Smith and, on a more popular level, Madonna. . .  She fits well with the odd, androgynous hormonal chemistry of our particular epoch. \" Kahlo's posthumous popularity and the commercialization of her image have drawn criticism from many scholars and cultural commenters, who think that, not only have many facets of her life been mythologized, but the dramatic aspects of her biography have also overshadowed her art, producing a simplistic reading of her works in which they are reduced to literal descriptions of events in her life.  According to journalist Stephanie Mencimer, Kahlo \"has been embraced as a poster child for every possible politically correct cause\" and like a game of telephone, the more Kahlo's story has been told, the more it has been distorted, omitting uncomfortable details that show her to be a far more complex and flawed figure than the movies and cookbooks suggest.  This elevation of the artist over the art diminishes the public understanding of Kahlo's place in history and overshadows the deeper and more disturbing truths in her work.  Even more troubling, though, is that by airbrushing her biography, Kahlo's promoters have set her up for the inevitable fall so typical of women artists, that time when the contrarians will band together and take sport in shooting down her inflated image, and with it, her art. \" Baddeley has compared the interest in Kahlo's life to the interest in the troubled life of Vincent van Gogh but has also stated that a crucial difference between the two is that most people associate Van Gogh with his paintings, whereas Kahlo is usually signified by an image of herself - an intriguing commentary on the way male and female artists are regarded.  Similarly, Peter Wollen has compared Kahlo's cult-like following to that of Sylvia Plath, whose \"unusually complex and contradictory art\" has been overshadowed by simplified focus on her life.  Commemorations and characterizations La Casa Azul , which has been open to the public since 1958 as a museum dedicated to Frida Kahlo.  Kahlo's legacy has been commemorated in several ways.  La Casa Azul, her home in Coyoacan, was opened as a museum in 1958, and has become one of the most popular museums in Mexico City, with approximately 25,000 visitors monthly. The city dedicated a park, Parque Frida Kahlo, to her in Coyoacan in 1985. The park features a bronze statue of Kahlo. In the United States, she became the first Hispanic woman to be honored with a U. S.  postage stamp in 2001, and was inducted into the Legacy Walk, an outdoor public display in Chicago that celebrates LGBT history and people, in 2012. Kahlo received several commemorations on the centenary of her birth in 2007, and some on the centenary of the birthyear she attested to, 2010.  These included the Bank of Mexico releasing a new MXN$ 500-peso note, featuring Kahlo's painting titled Love's Embrace of the Universe, Earth, (Mexico), I, Diego, and Mr.  Xolotl (1949) on the reverse of the note and Diego Rivera on the front. The largest retrospective of her works at Mexico City's Palacio de Bellas Artes attracted approximately 75,000 visitors. In addition to other tributes, Kahlo's life and art have inspired artists in various fields.  In 1984, Paul Leduc released a biopic titled Frida, naturaleza viva, starring Ofelia Medina as Kahlo.  She is the protagonist of three fictional novels, Barbara Mujica's Frida (2001), Slavenka Drakulic's Frida's Bed (2008), and Barbara Kingsolver's The Lacuna (2009). In 1994, American jazz flautist and composer James Newton released an album titled Suite for Frida Kahlo. Scottish singer/songwriter, Michael Marra, wrote a song in homage to Kahlo entitled Frida Kahlo's Visit to the Taybridge Bar. In 2017, author Monica Brown and illustrator John Parra published a children's book on Kahlo, Frida Kahlo and her Animalitos, which focuses primarily on the animals and pets in Kahlo's life and art. In the visual arts, Kahlo's influence has reached wide and far: In 1996, and again in 2005, the Mexican Cultural Institute in Washington, DC coordinated an \"Homage to Frida Kahlo\" exhibition which showcased Kahlo-related artwork by artists from all over the world in Washington's Fraser Gallery. Additionally, notable artists such as Marina Abramovic, Alana Archer, Gabriela Gonzalez Dellosso, Yasumasa Morimura, Cris Melo, Rupert Garcia, and others have used or appropriated Kahlo's imagery into their own works.  Kahlo has also been the subject of several stage performances.  Annabelle Lopez Ochoa choreographed a one-act ballet titled Broken Wings for the English National Ballet, which debuted in 2016, Tamara Rojo originated Kahlo in the ballet. Dutch National Ballet then commissioned Lopez Ochoa to created a full-length version of the ballet, Frida, which premiered in 2020, with Maia Makhateli as Kahlo. She also inspired two operas, Robert Xavier Rodriguez's Frida, which premiered at the American Music Theater Festival in Philadelphia in 1991, and Kalevi Aho's Frida y Diego, which premiered at the Helsinki Music Centre in Helsinki, Finland in 2014. She was the main character in several plays, including Dolores C.  Sendler's Goodbye, My Friduchita (1999), Robert Lepage and Sophie Faucher's La Casa Azul (2002), Humberto Robles' Frida Kahlo: Viva la vida! (2009), and Rita Ortez Provost's Tree of Hope (2014). In 2018, Mattel unveiled seventeen new Barbie dolls in celebration of International Women's Day, including one of Kahlo.  Critics objected to the doll's slim waist and noticeably missing unibrow. In 2014 Kahlo was one of the inaugural honorees in the Rainbow Honor Walk, a walk of fame in San Francisco's Castro neighborhood noting LGBTQ people who have \"made significant contributions in their fields\". In 2018, San Francisco Board of Supervisors unanimously voted to rename Phelan Avenue to Frida Kahlo Way.  Frida Kahlo Way is the home of City College of San Francisco and Archbishop Riordan High School. In 2019, Frida was featured on a mural painted by Rafael Blanco in downtown Reno, Nevada.  Solo exhibitions References Informational notes ^ Kahlo was given her first two names so that she could be baptized according to Catholic traditions, but was always called Frida.  She preferred to spell her name \"Frieda\" until the late 1930s, when she dropped the 'e' as she did not wish to be associated with Germany during Hitler 's rule.  ^ Given Kahlo's later problems with scoliosis and with her hips and limbs, neurologist Budrys Valmantas has argued that she had a congenital condition, spina bifida , which was diagnosed by Dr.  Leo Eloesser when she was a young adult.  Psychologist and art historian Dr.  Salomon Grimberg disagrees, stating that Kahlo's problems were instead the result of not wearing an orthopedic shoe on her affected right leg, which led to damage to her hips and spine.

The Frida Kahlo Museum opened to the public in 1958, a year after Riveras death.  Summary Read a brief summary of this topic Frida Kahlo, in full Frida Kahlo de Rivera, original name Magdalena Carmen Frieda Kahlo y Calderon, (born July 6, 1907, Coyoacan, Mexico--died July 13, 1954, Coyoacan), Mexican painter best known for her uncompromising and brilliantly coloured self-portraits that deal with such themes as identity, the human body, and death.  Although she denied the connection, she is often identified as a Surrealist.  In addition to her work, Kahlo was known for her tumultuous relationship with muralist Diego Rivera (married 1929, divorced 1939, remarried 1940).  Early years and bus accident Kahlo was born to a German father of Hungarian descent and a Mexican mother of Spanish and Native American descent.  Later, during her artistic career, Kahlo explored her identity by frequently depicting her ancestry as binary opposites: the colonial European side and the indigenous Mexican side.  As a child, she suffered a bout of polio that left her with a slight limp, a chronic ailment she would endure throughout her life.  Kahlo was especially close to her father, who was a professional photographer, and she frequently assisted him in his studio, where she acquired a sharp eye for detail.  Although Kahlo took some drawing classes, she was more interested in science, and in 1922 she entered the National Preparatory School in Mexico City with an interest in eventually studying medicine.  While there she met Rivera, who was working on a mural for the schools auditorium.  Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo In 1925 Kahlo was involved in a bus accident, which so seriously injured her that she had to undergo more than 30 medical operations in her lifetime.  During her slow recovery, Kahlo taught herself to paint, and she read frequently, studying the art of the Old Masters.  In one of her early paintings, Self-Portrait Wearing a Velvet Dress (1926), Kahlo painted a regal waist-length portrait of herself against a dark background with roiling stylized waves.  Although the painting is fairly abstract, Kahlos soft modeling of her face shows her interest in realism.  The stoic gaze so prevalent in her later art is already evident, and the exaggeratedly long neck and fingers reveal her interest in the Mannerist painter Il Bronzino.  After her convalescence, Kahlo joined the Mexican Communist Party (PCM), where she met Rivera once again.  She showed him some of her work, and he encouraged her to continue to paint. ", "article_2": "Mexican artist Frida Kahlo is remembered for her self-portraits, pain and passion, and bold, vibrant colors.  She is celebrated in Mexico for her attention to Mexican and indigenous culture and by feminists for her depiction of the female experience and form.  Kahlo, who suffered from polio as a child, nearly died in a bus accident as a teenager.  She suffered multiple fractures of her spine, collarbone and ribs, a shattered pelvis, broken foot and a dislocated shoulder.  She began to focus heavily on painting while recovering in a body cast.  In her lifetime, she had 30 operations.  Life experience is a common theme in Kahlo's approximately 200 paintings, sketches and drawings.  Her physical and emotional pain are depicted starkly on canvases, as is her turbulent relationship with her husband, fellow artist Diego Rivera, who she married twice.  Of her 143 paintings, 55 are self-portraits.  The devastation to her body from the bus accident is shown in stark detail in The Broken Column.  Kahlo is depicted nearly naked, split down the middle, with her spine presented as a broken decorative column.  Her skin is dotted with nails.  She is also fitted with a surgical brace.  Kahlo's first self-portrait was Self-Portrait in a Velvet Dress in 1926.  It was painted in the style of 19th Century Mexican portrait painters who themselves were greatly influenced by the European Renaissance masters.  She also sometimes drew from the Mexican painters in her use of a background of tied-back drapes.  Self-Portrait - Time Flies (1929), Portrait of a Woman in White (1930) and Self-Portrait Dedicated to Leon Trotsky (1937) all bear this background.  In her second-self portrait, \"Time Flies,\" Kahlo uses a folk style and vibrant colors.  She wears peasant clothing, and the red, white and green in the painting are the colors of the Mexican flag.  During her life, self portrait is a subject that Frida Kahlo always returns to, as artists have always returned to their beloved themes - Vincent van Gogh his Sunflowers, Rembrandt his Self Portrait, and Claude Monet his Water Lilies.  I paint self-portraits because I am so often alone, because I am the person I know best. \" - Frida Kahlo Frida and Diego: Love and Pain Kahlo and Rivera had a tumultuous relationship, marked by multiple affairs on both sides.  Self-Portrait With Cropped Hair (1940), Kahlo is depicted in a man's suit, holding a pair of scissors, with her fallen hair around the chair in which she sits.  This represents the times she would cut the hair Rivera loved when he had affairs.  The 1937 painting Memory, the Heart, shows Kahlo's pain over her husband's affair with her younger sister Christina.  A large broken heart at her feet shows the intensity of Kahlo's anguish.  Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera divorced in 1939, but reunited a year later and remarried.  The Two Fridas (1939) depicts Kahlo twice, shortly after the divorce.  One Frida wears a costume from the Tehuana region of Mexico, representing the Frida that Diego loved.  The other Frida wears a European dress as the woman who Diego betrayed and rejected.  Later, she is back in Tehuana dress in Self-Portrait as a Tehuana (1943) and Self Portrait (1948).  Pre-Columbian artifacts were common both in the Kahlo/Rivera home (Diego collected sculptures and idols, and Frida collected Jewelry) and in Kahlo's paintings.  She wore jewelry from this period in Self-Portrait - Time Flies (1926), Self-Portrait With Monkey (1938) and Self-Portrait With Braid (1941), among others.  Other Pre-Columbian artifacts are found in The Four Inhabitants of Mexico City (1938), Girl With Death Mask (1938) and Self-Portrait With Small Monkeys (1945).  Surreal or Realist? Frida Kahlo participated in the \"International Exhibition of Surrealism\" in 1940 at the Galeria de Arte, Mexicano.  There, she exhibited her two largest paintings: The Two Fridas and The Wounded Table (1940).  Surrealist Andrew Breton considered Kahlo a surrealistic, a label Kahlo rejected, saying she just painted her reality.  However, In 1945, when Don Jose Domingo Lavin asked Frida Kahlo to read the book Moses and Monotheism by Sigmund Freud - whose psychoanalysis works Surrealism is based on - and paint her understanding and interpretation of this book.  Frida Kahlo painted Moses, and this painting was recognized as second prize at the annual art exhibition in the Palacio de Bellas Artes.  Kahlo did not sell many paintings in her lifetime, although she painted occasional portraits on commission.  She had only one solo exhibition in Mexico in her lifetime, in 1953, just a year before her death at the age of 47.  My painting carries with it the message of pain. \" - Frida Kahlo Today, her works sell for very high prices.  In May 2006, Frida Kahlo self-portrait, Roots, was sold for $5. 62 million at a Sotheby's auction in New York, sets a record as the most expensive Latin American work ever purchased at auction, and also makes Frida Kahlo one of the highest-selling woman in art.  Widely known for her Marxist leanings, Frida, along with Marxism Revolutionary Che Guevara and a small band of contemporary figures, has become a countercultural symbol of the 20th century, and created a legacy in art history that continues to inspire the imagination and mind.  Born in 1907, dead at 47, Frida Kahlo achieved celebrity even in her brief lifetime that extended far beyond Mexico's borders, although nothing like the cult status that would eventually make her the mother of the selfie, her indelible image recognizable everywhere.  At the Frida Kahlo Museum in Mexico City, her personal belongings are on display throughout the house, as if she still lived there.  Kahlo was born and grew up in this building, whose cobalt walls gave way to the nickname of the Blue House.  She lived there with her husband for some years, and she died there.  The facility is the most popular museum in the Coyoacan neighborhood and among the most visited in Mexico City. ", "article_3": "Introduction Magdalena Carmen Frida Kahlo y Calderon (Spanish pronunciation: ['frida 'kalo]; 6 July 1907 - 13 July 1954) was a Mexican painter known for her many portraits, self-portraits, and works inspired by the nature and artifacts of Mexico.  Inspired by the country's popular culture, she employed a naive folk art style to explore questions of identity, postcolonialism, gender, class, and race in Mexican society.  Her paintings often had strong autobiographical elements and mixed realism with fantasy.  In addition to belonging to the post-revolutionary Mexicayotl movement, which sought to define a Mexican identity, Kahlo has been described as a surrealist or magical realist.  She is known for painting about her experience of chronic pain. Born to a German father and a mestiza mother, Kahlo spent most of her childhood and adult life at La Casa Azul, her family home in Coyoacan - now publicly accessible as the Frida Kahlo Museum.  Although she was disabled by polio as a child, Kahlo had been a promising student headed for medical school until being injured in a bus accident at the age of 18, which caused her lifelong pain and medical problems.  During her recovery, she returned to her childhood interest in art with the idea of becoming an artist.  Kahlo's interests in politics and art led her to join the Mexican Communist Party in 1927, through which she met fellow Mexican artist Diego Rivera.  The couple married in 1929 and spent the late 1920s and early 1930s travelling in Mexico and the United States together.  During this time, she developed her artistic style, drawing her main inspiration from Mexican folk culture, and painted mostly small self-portraits that mixed elements from pre-Columbian and Catholic beliefs.  Her paintings raised the interest of Surrealist artist Andre Breton, who arranged for Kahlo's first solo exhibition at the Julien Levy Gallery in New York in 1938; the exhibition was a success and was followed by another in Paris in 1939.  While the French exhibition was less successful, the Louvre purchased a painting from Kahlo, The Frame, making her the first Mexican artist to be featured in their collection.  Throughout the 1940s, Kahlo participated in exhibitions in Mexico and the United States and worked as an art teacher.  She taught at the Escuela Nacional de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado (\"La Esmeralda\") and was a founding member of the Seminario de Cultura Mexicana.  Kahlo's always-fragile health began to decline in the same decade.  She had her first solo exhibition in Mexico in 1953, shortly before her death in 1954 at the age of 47.  Kahlo's work as an artist remained relatively unknown until the late 1970s, when her work was rediscovered by art historians and political activists.  By the early 1990s, not only had she become a recognized figure in art history, but she was also regarded as an icon for Chicanos, the feminism movement, and the LGBTQ+ movement.  Kahlo's work has been celebrated internationally as emblematic of Mexican national and indigenous traditions and by feminists for what is seen as its uncompromising depiction of the female experience and form.

She painted using vibrant colors in a style that was influenced by indigenous cultures of Mexico as well as by European influences that include Realism, Symbolism, and Surrealism.  Many of her works are self-portraits that symbolically express her own pain and sexuality.  In 1929 Kahlo married the Mexican muralist Diego Rivera.  They shared political views, and he encouraged her artistic endeavors. [citation needed] Although she has long been recognized as an important painter, public awareness of her work has become more widespread since the 1970s. [citation needed] Her \"Blue\" house in Coyoacan, Mexico City is a museum, donated by Diego Rivera upon his death in 1957.  (From Wikipedia)", "article_5": "Painter Frida Kahlo was a Mexican artist who was married to Diego Rivera and is still admired as a feminist icon.  Who Was Frida Kahlo? Artist Frida Kahlo was considered one of Mexico's greatest artists who began painting mostly self-portraits after she was severely injured in a bus accident.  Kahlo later became politically active and married fellow communist artist Diego Rivera in 1929.  She exhibited her paintings in Paris and Mexico before her death in 1954.  Family, Education and Early Life Kahlo was born Magdalena Carmen Frieda Kahlo y Calderon on July 6, 1907, in Coyoacan, Mexico City, Mexico.  Kahlo's father, Wilhelm (also called Guillermo), was a German photographer who had immigrated to Mexico where he met and married her mother Matilde.  She had two older sisters, Matilde and Adriana, and her younger sister, Cristina, was born the year after Kahlo.  Around the age of six, Kahlo contracted polio, which caused her to be bedridden for nine months.  While she recovered from the illness, she limped when she walked because the disease had damaged her right leg and foot.  Her father encouraged her to play soccer, go swimming, and even wrestle -- highly unusual moves for a girl at the time -- to help aid in her recovery.  In 1922, Kahlo enrolled at the renowned National Preparatory School.  She was one of the few female students to attend the school, and she became known for her jovial spirit and her love of colorful, traditional clothes and jewelry.  While at school, Kahlo hung out with a group of politically and intellectually like-minded students.  Becoming more politically active, Kahlo joined the Young Communist League and the Mexican Communist Party.  Frida Kahlo's Life in Photos 6 Gallery 6 Images Frida Kahlo's Accident On September 17, 1925, Kahlo and Alejandro Gomez Arias, a school friend with whom she was romantically involved, were traveling together on a bus when the vehicle collided with a streetcar.  As a result of the collision, Kahlo was impaled by a steel handrail, which went into her hip and came out the other side.  She suffered several serious injuries as a result, including fractures in her spine and pelvis.  After staying at the Red Cross Hospital in Mexico City for several weeks, Kahlo returned home to recuperate further.  She began painting during her recovery and finished her first self-portrait the following year, which she gave to Gomez Arias.  Frida Kahlo's Marriage to Diego Rivera In 1929, Kahlo and famed Mexican muralist Diego Rivera married.  Kahlo and Rivera first met in 1922 when he went to work on a project at her high school.  Kahlo often watched as Rivera created a mural called The Creation in the schools lecture hall.  According to some reports, she told a friend that she would someday have Riveras baby.  Kahlo reconnected with Rivera in 1928.  He encouraged her artwork, and the two began a relationship.  During their early years together, Kahlo often followed Rivera based on where the commissions that Rivera received were.  In 1930, they lived in San Francisco, California.  They then went to New York City for Riveras show at the Museum of Modern Art and later moved to Detroit for Riveras commission with the Detroit Institute of Arts.  Kahlo and Riveras time in New York City in 1933 was surrounded by controversy.  Commissioned by Nelson Rockefeller, Rivera created a mural entitled Man at the Crossroads in the RCA Building at Rockefeller Center.  Rockefeller halted the work on the project after Rivera included a portrait of communist leader Vladimir Lenin in the mural, which was later painted over.  Months after this incident, the couple returned to Mexico and went to live in San Angel, Mexico.  Never a traditional union, Kahlo and Rivera kept separate, but adjoining homes and studios in San Angel.  She was saddened by his many infidelities, including an affair with her sister Cristina.  In response to this familial betrayal, Kahlo cut off most of her trademark long dark hair.  Desperately wanting to have a child, she again experienced heartbreak when she miscarried in 1934.  Kahlo and Rivera went through periods of separation, but they joined together to help exiled Soviet communist Leon Trotsky and his wife Natalia in 1937.  The Trotskys came to stay with them at the Blue House (Kahlo's childhood home) for a time in 1937 as Trotsky had received asylum in Mexico.  Once a rival of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, Trotsky feared that he would be assassinated by his old nemesis.  Kahlo and Trotsky reportedly had a brief affair during this time.  Kahlo divorced Rivera in 1939.  They did not stay divorced for long, remarrying in 1940.  The couple continued to lead largely separate lives, both becoming involved with other people over the years.  PHOTOS: Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera's Colorful Love Story 8 Gallery 8 Images Artistic Career While she never considered herself a surrealist, Kahlo befriended one of the primary figures in that artistic and literary movement, Andre Breton, in 1938.  That same year, she had a major exhibition at a New York City gallery, selling about half of the 25 paintings shown there.  Kahlo also received two commissions, including one from famed magazine editor Clare Boothe Luce, as a result of the show.  In 1939, Kahlo went to live in Paris for a time.  There she exhibited some of her paintings and developed friendships with such artists as Marcel Duchamp and Pablo Picasso.  Kahlo received a commission from the Mexican government for five portraits of important Mexican women in 1941, but she was unable to finish the project.  She lost her beloved father that year and continued to suffer from chronic health problems.  Despite her personal challenges, her work continued to grow in popularity and was included in numerous group shows around this time.  In 1953, Kahlo received her first solo exhibition in Mexico.  While bedridden at the time, Kahlo did not miss out on the exhibitions opening.  Arriving by ambulance, Kahlo spent the evening talking and celebrating with the events attendees from the comfort of a four-poster bed set up in the gallery just for her.  After Kahlos death, the feminist movement of the 1970s led to renewed interest in her life and work, as Kahlo was viewed by many as an icon of female creativity.  Frida Kahlo's Most Famous Paintings Many of Kahlos works were self-portraits.  A few of her most notable paintings include: 'Frieda and Diego Rivera' (1931) Kahlo showed this painting at the Sixth Annual Exhibition of the San Francisco Society of Women Artists, the city where she was living with Rivera at the time.  In the work, painted two years after the couple married, Kahlo lightly holds Riveras hand as he grasps a palette and paintbrushes with the other -- a stiffly formal pose hinting at the couples future tumultuous relationship.  The work now lives at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.  'Henry Ford Hospital' (1932) In 1932, Kahlo incorporated graphic and surrealistic elements in her work.  In this painting, a naked Kahlo appears on a hospital bed with several items -- a fetus, a snail, a flower, a pelvis and others -- floating around her and connected to her by red, veinlike strings.  As with her earlier self-portraits, the work was deeply personal, telling the story of her second miscarriage.  'The Suicide of Dorothy Hale' (1939) Kahlo was asked to paint a portrait of Luce and Kahlo's mutual friend, actress Dorothy Hale, who had committed suicide earlier that year by jumping from a high-rise building.  The painting was intended as a gift for Hale's grieving mother.  Rather than a traditional portrait, however, Kahlo painted the story of Hale's tragic leap.  While the work has been heralded by critics, its patron was horrified at the finished painting.  'The Two Fridas' (1939) One of Kahlos most famous works, the painting shows two versions of the artist sitting side by side, with both of their hearts exposed.  One Frida is dressed nearly all in white and has a damaged heart and spots of blood on her clothing.  The other wears bold colored clothing and has an intact heart.  These figures are believed to represent \"unloved\" and \"loved\" versions of Kahlo.  'The Broken Column' (1944) Kahlo shared her physical challenges through her art again with this painting, which depicted a nearly nude Kahlo split down the middle, revealing her spine as a shattered decorative column.  She also wears a surgical brace and her skin is studded with tacks or nails.  Around this time, Kahlo had several surgeries and wore special corsets to try to fix her back.  She would continue to seek a variety of treatments for her chronic physical pain with little success.  Frida Kahlos Death About a week after her 47th birthday, Kahlo died on July 13, 1954, at her beloved Blue House.  There has been some speculation regarding the nature of her death.  It was reported to be caused by a pulmonary embolism, but there have also been stories about a possible suicide.  Kahlos health issues became nearly all-consuming in 1950.  After being diagnosed with gangrene in her right foot, Kahlo spent nine months in the hospital and had several operations during this time.  She continued to paint and support political causes despite having limited mobility.  In 1953, part of Kahlos right leg was amputated to stop the spread of gangrene.  Deeply depressed, Kahlo was hospitalized again in April 1954 because of poor health, or, as some reports indicated, a suicide attempt.  She returned to the hospital two months later with bronchial pneumonia.  No matter her physical condition, Kahlo did not let that stand in the way of her political activism.  Her final public appearance was a demonstration against the U. S. -backed overthrow of President Jacobo Arbenz of Guatemala on July 2nd.  Movie on Frida Kahlo Kahlos life was the subject of a 2002 film entitled Frida, starring Salma Hayek as the artist and Alfred Molina as Rivera.  Directed by Julie Taymor, the film was nominated for six Academy Awards and won for Best Makeup and Original Score.  Frida Kahlo Museum The family home where Kahlo was born and grew up, later referred to as the Blue House or Casa Azul, was opened as a museum in 1958.  Located in Coyoacan, Mexico City, the Museo Frida Kahlo houses artifacts from the artist along with important works including Viva la Vida (1954), Frida and Caesarean (1931) and Portrait of my father Wilhelm Kahlo (1952).  Book on Frida Kahlo Hayden Herreras 1983 book on Kahlo, Frida: A Biography of Frida Kahlo, helped to stir up interest in the artist.  The biographical work covers Kahlos childhood, accident, artistic career, marriage to Diego Rivera, association with the communist party and love affairs. "}}

The convictions have been questioned by human rights organizations ARTICLE 19, Committee to Protect Journalists, and Union of Councils for Soviet Jews. Stomakhin was a member of Maoist Revolutionary Workers Party. Later he became a leader of a radical political group \"Revolutionary Contact Association\" (RCA).  Since 2000, Boris Stomakhin was an editor of the monthly newspaper \"Radical Politics\".  In addition, he contributed numerous materials to Kavkaz Center, the radical Islamic internet agency that promoted the independence of Chechnya and is maintained by Chechen separatists.  According to Russian court, Stomakhin called for the violent overthrow of government, claimed that Russian troops in Chechnya are \"occupiers\", compared President Vladimir Putin to Saddam Hussein and Slobodan Milosevic. , called modern Russia \"an Evil empire\" that must be destroyed, and considered Shamil Basaev and Salman Raduev as heroes of legitimate Chechen resistance. According to Valeria Novodvorskaya and Yakov Krotov, Stomakhin did not actually promote any terrorist activities and became a political prisoner. Opening of a criminal case against Stomakhin  Attempts to prosecute Stomakhin for hate speech were made unsuccessfully in 2000. Successful application to prosecute Stomakhin was made by opposition Communist Party State Duma member Viktor Zorkaltsev at the request of another Communist party member Valentina Lavrova. Valentina Lavrova has acquired a copy of Stomakhin Radical Politics periodical, while being on rally in Mayakovsky Square, Moscow, in September 2002. Being insulted by the text of periodicals she hasn't rushed immediately to authorities, and began to collect the evidence by visiting public actions of Stomakhin and acquiring new numbers of his periodical.  After collecting the evidence she referred not to police or security authorities, but to the member of parliament, Viktor Zorkaltsev.

Having returned to Moscow, Stomakhin was arrested on March 21, 2006.  Stomakhin tried to escape during his arrest and fell down from fourth floor of his building, according to his lawyer Alexei Golubev and news reports. His spine and bones were broken as a result.  Stomakhin was subsequently interrogated.  Psychiatry experts at the Moscow Serbsky Institute found that Stomakhin was competent to stand trial. He was sentenced to five years of prison for inciting hatred and defamatory statements aimed at groups and persons of particular religious and ethnic background and for promoting violent change of constitutional regime and violation of territorial integrity of Russian Federation (articles 280 and 282 of the Russian Criminal Code).

European Court of Human Rights decision  In May 2018 the European Court of Human Rights found that the Stomakhins punishment was not proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued and awarded him EUR 12,500 in respect of non-pecuniary damage. In September 2019 Stomakhin was released from imprisonment.  In November 2019 he left Russia and asked for asylium in the Ukraine. Alexander Litvinenko said that \"people like Boris are the most dangerous for the Putin's regime that deceived millions of Russians, brought them to their knees and transformed them to slaves\". According to priest Yakov Krotov, \"Stomakin made a picture of Putin with swastika? Well, I believe that not only Putin and his generals deserve to wear swastika, but also all Russian civilians who pretend that they know nothing about the genocide of Chechens and discrimination of Georgians in Russia\" Stomakhin was qualified as a prisoner of conscience\" by the Union of Councils for Soviet Jews and as a political prisoner in an open letter send to G7 leaders by Russia's human rights activists Sergei Kovalev, Yelena Bonner.  A group of Russian citizens including Vladimir Bukovsky condemned the conviction of Stomakhin as prosecution of free speech. Widow of Andrei Sakharov Elena Bonner compared Stomakhin with Soviet dissidents who were prosecuted for their writings by Yuri Andropov. Human rights activist Svetlana Gannushkina and politician Valeria Novodvorskaya argued that Stomakhin's writings while being \"absolutely outrageous\" and \"inciting national hatred\" had not been a public threat: they were very unlikely to incite anybody Journalist Vladimir Abarinov criticized court proceedings as an example of kangaroo court He claimed that the criminal case against Stomakhin was opened based on solely an article about Russian Orthodox Church that was not written by Stomakhin.  It was decided by the court that Stomakhin actually copied this article from a Live Journal entry, as well as other publications of numerous news agencies. The authors of the original work disagree to share their responsibility with Stomakhin citing that he had reproduced their works without permission and distorted the original meaning. M.  Smolin from Komsomolskaya Pravda described views of Stomakhin as extremely Russophobic. Critics of the court decision were denounced by publicist Maxim Sokolov .  In his article published in Izvestia newspaper after the conviction of Stomakhin he remarked that Stomakhin's writings were worse than Mein Kampf by Adolf Hitler (\"Against this backdrop, Mein Kampf is a textbook of humanism. \") and that the hate speech must be prosecuted according to the article 282 of the Russian criminal code.  He cited in support a text written by Boris Stomakhin, that \"Russian Federation and Russians must be exterminated\" by all available means including nuclear bomb, because all Russians are collectively responsible for actions of their government with respect to Chechen people.  According to Sokolov, the cited passage made application of the article 282 completely appropriate. Aleksandr Cherkasov of the human rights center Memorial stated that they did not consider Stomakhin political prisoner, because his writings did call for discrimination and violence.  At the same time he described the punishment as excessive, because Stomakhin did not organize any criminal acts.", "article_1": "Boris Vladimirovitx Stomakhin (en rus: Boris Vladimirovich Stomakhin) (Moscou, 24 d'agost de 1974), es un activista i politic radical rus, editor del diari \"Politica radical\" (\"Radikal'naia politika\").

Russia, the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) launched the message to all domestic authorities to adopt a \"cautious approach\" in determining the scope of \"hate speech\" crimes and to avoid \"excessive interference\" with the right to freedom of expression, especially when action is taken against 'hate speech or extremist opinions that are mere criticism of the government, state institutions and their policies and practices.  The judgment of 9 May 2018, in which the ECtHR unanimously found a violation of Article 10 ECHR, sets an important standard: as judge Keller observed in her concurring opinion, \"it is the first time that this Court has had to decide on a case which stems from the application of the Suppression of Extremist Activities Act (. . ), and will thus be the starting point of a body of case-law which will serve as a reference not only in future cases concerning Russia, but for all other Member States as well. \" Conviction for extremist speech and incitement to hatred Acting both as a journalist working for a magazine, and as an activist being the founder, owner, publisher and editor-in-chief of a monthly newsletter Radikalnaya Politika (\"Radical Politics\"), Boris Vladimirovich Stomakhin published in 2003 a series of articles touching on the events in the Chechen Republic.  The articles sharply criticized the Russian government and the actions by the army and expressed support for the Chechen rebel separatist movement.  The Russian courts found Stomakhin guilty of \"having publicly appealed to extremist activities through the mass media\" (Article 280 SS 2 of the Russian Criminal Code (CC)) and of having committed \"actions aimed at inciting hatred and enmity as well as at humiliating the dignity of an individual or group of individuals on the grounds of ethnicity, origin, attitude towards religion and membership of a social group, through the mass media\" (Article 282 SS 1 CC).  They found that the impugned texts had had a clear extremist leaning and incited actions prohibited by the Federal law on Suppression of Extremist Activities.  Stomakhin was sentenced to five years in prison and given a three-year ban on practising journalism.  He served the sentence in full and was released in March 2011.  In 2007, while in prison, Stomakhin lodged an application with the ECtHR, complaining mainly about a violation of his right to freedom of expression.  He argued that he had simply expressed his opinion on political events in Russia, in particular the conflict in Chechnya and he denied supporting extremism.  The ECtHR considers that in the period when Stomakhin was tried and convicted, matters relating to the conflict in the Chechen Republic were of a very sensitive nature and required particular vigilance on the part of the authorities.  It accepts, accordingly, that Stomakhins conviction can be seen as having pursued the aims of protecting the rights of others as well as protecting national security, territorial integrity and public safety and preventing disorder and crime, while the interference with his right to freedom of expression was \"prescribed by law\", as it was based on Articles 280 SS 2 and 282 SS 1 of the Russian Criminal Code.  Hence, the decisive question was whether Stomakhins conviction was justified, being \"necessary in a democratic society\".  The ECtHR first reiterates that there is little scope under Article 10 SS 2 ECHR for restrictions on political speech or on debate on questions of public interest and that \"the limits of permissible criticism are wider with regard to the government than in relation to a private citizen or even a politician.  In a democratic system the actions or omissions of the government must be subject to the close scrutiny not only of the legislative and judicial authorities but also of public opinion.  Moreover, the dominant position which the government occupies makes it necessary for it to display restraint in resorting to criminal proceedings, particularly where other means are available for replying to the unjustified attacks and criticisms of its adversaries\".  However, as \"tolerance and respect for the equal dignity of all human beings constitute the foundations of a democratic, pluralistic society\", it may be considered necessary in democratic societies to sanction or even prevent all forms of expression which spread, incite, promote or justify violence, hatred or intolerance provided that restrictions or penalties imposed are proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.  In its assessment of the interference with freedom of expression in cases concerning expressions alleged to stir up or justify violence, hatred or intolerance, the ECtHR refers to a set of factors, as applied in its Grand Chamber judgment in Perincek v.  Switzerland (see also our blog post here).  Therefore, the ECtHR examines the case with a particular regard to the context in which the impugned statements were published, their nature and wording, their potential to lead to harmful consequences and the reasons adduced by the Russian courts to justify the interference in question.  The context and the wording of the texts Referring to \"the difficult situation prevailing in the Chechen Republic at the time, where separatist tendencies in the region led to serious disturbances between Russias federal armed and security forces and the Chechen rebel fighters and resulted in a heavy loss of life in that region as well as in deadly terrorist attacks in other regions of Russia\", and the particular caution on the part of the national authorities when taking action against \"the publication of opinions which advocate recourse to violence against the State lest the media become a vehicle for the dissemination of hate speech and the promotion of violence\", the ECtHR emphasizes that \"a fair balance should be struck between the individuals fundamental right to freedom of expression and a democratic societys legitimate right to protect itself against the activities of terrorist organisations\".  Turning to the wording of the texts in question, the ECtHR considers that the impugned statements can be divided into three groups and it examines each group separately.  The first group of statements has justified terrorism, vilified Russian servicemen to the extent that they might have become targets for actual attack and had praised Chechen leaders in the context of approving of violence.  Those statements have therefore gone beyond the limits of acceptable criticism and the ECtHR finds that the Russian courts treatment of them has been justified.  The ECtHR also finds that some of Stomakhins criticisms of Orthodox believers and ethnic Russians has incited hatred and enmity and it confirms that the Russian courts considerations have been \"relevant and sufficient\" to justify a conviction.  The ECtHR is of the opinion however that the domestic courts have been too harsh in other aspects.  In particular, some statements about the war have not gone beyond acceptable limits of criticism, which are wide when it comes to governments.  According to the ECtHR these statements merely concerned \"criticism of the State and the actions of the federal armed and security forces as a part of the machinery of the State\".  The ECtHR finds that the domestic courts have also taken other comments on Russian servicemen out of context, or had failed even to refer to any particular texts which, according to them, had had discriminatory or humiliating connotations with regard the national dignity of people practising the Orthodox religion.  The ECtHR emphasizes that it is in the nature of political speech to be controversial and often virulent and the fact that statements contain hard-hitting criticism of official policy and communicate a one-sided view of the origin of and responsibility for the situation addressed by them is insufficient, in itself, to justify an interference with freedom of expression.  Although some of Stomakhins statements were admittedly quite virulent in their language and contain strongly worded statements, the ECtHR discerns no elements in them other than a criticism of the Russian government and their actions during the armed conflict in the Chechen Republic.  Other statements were published during an electoral campaign, a period \"where it was particularly important that opinions and information of all kinds were permitted to circulate freely\".  Therefore the ECtHR concludes that for some statements the need for the restriction was not convincingly demonstrated.  The impact of the texts and the proportionality of the sanction While the ECtHR leaves open the question whether a ban on the exercise of journalistic activities, as such, is compatible with Article 10 ECHR, it finds that the sanction to five years imprisonment is not proportionate.  The ECtHR observes that Stomakhin had no criminal record and thus had never been convicted of any similar offence.  It also finds the circulation of the newsletter at issue was insignificant, and that the potential impact of the impugned statements was very limited.  The ECtHR finds the punishment to five years imprisonment \"an extremely harsh measure\", particularly bearing in mind the Russian authorities failure to demonstrate convincingly \"the pressing social need\" to interfere with Stomakhins freedom of expression in respect of a number of the impugned statements.  The ECtHR finds that the interference in question was not \"necessary in a democratic society\", and that therefore there has been a violation of Article 10 ECHR.  Comments The judgment in Stomakhin v.  Russia confirms the importance of the strict scrutiny by the ECtHR of the findings and interpretations by domestic courts in cases of interferences with the right to freedom of (political) expression amounting to criticism of the government, the army, the police or other public or powerful institutions and their policy.  It also shows the need to make a distinction between articles, programmes or comments that incite to terrorism, violence, racism, discrimination or hatred on the one hand, and comments criticising merely the policy of the government, on the other hand.  In the past the ECtHR has not always succeeded to clarify this distinction and it has accepted sometimes in too broad and general terms interferences by national authorities with the right to freedom of political speech.  In the case of Feret v.  Belgium e. g.  the ECtHR failed to make a distinction between the statements of the applicant that effectively were to be considered as incitement to racism, discrimination and xenophobia, and the statements that were a (populist) right-wing criticism of the migration and integration policy of the Belgian Government at the time.  The judgment in Feret v.  Belgium also showed a lack of attention for the aspect of the disproportionate character of the punishment and the chilling effect that may occur in case of overbroad application of criminal law with regard political and polemic speech (read more here).  The most important message of the judgment in Stomakhin v.  Russia is the European Courts general formulated warning to all member states \"that it is vitally important that the domestic authorities adopt a cautious approach in determining the scope of \"hate speech\" crimes and strictly construe the relevant legal provisions in order to avoid excessive interference under the guise of action taken against \"hate speech\", where such charges are brought for a mere criticism of the Government, State institutions and their policies and practices\" (SS 117).  Some member states indeed have over-reacted in their fight against terrorism, extremism or radicalism, by imposing a long period of 'state of emergency with far-reaching limitations on the right to freedom of expression.  In its judgments of 20 March 2018 in the cases of Mehmet Hasan Altan v.  Turkey and Sahin Alpay v.  Turkey, the ECtHR emphasised that the existence of a \"public emergency threatening the life of the nation\" must not serve as a pretext for limiting freedom of political debate, which is at the very core of the concept of a democratic society.  Even in a state of emergency the Contracting States must bear in mind that any measures taken should seek to protect the democratic order from the threats to it, and every effort must be made to safeguard the values of a democratic society, such as pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness.  The ECtHR was of the opinion that the interferences complained of with the applicant journalists rights would inevitably have a chilling effect on freedom of expression by intimidating civil society and silencing dissenting voices in Turkey (see blog post on Strasbourg Observers).  Also other countries have recently promulgated overbroad new legislation restricting the freedom of (political) expression.  In its judgment 31/2018 of 15 March 2018 the Belgiums Constitutional Court annulled a government amendment to an anti-terrorism provision in Article 140bis of the Belgian Criminal Code.  The amendment broadened the scope of incrimination of public incitement to commit a terrorist attack, by removing one of the essential components of determining criminality: the case-by-case assessment of the \"risk\" of offenses being committed.  The amendment aimed to making speeches on the topic of terrorism in itself an incitement to commit a terrorist attack, even when there exists no risk of an attack being committed.  In its ruling, the Constitutional Court observed that the need to simplify the production of evidence could not justify the fact that a person could be sentenced up to 10 years imprisonment for incitement to terrorism if there are no serious indications that a terrorist crime would in fact be committed.  The Court considered the new provision in breach with the right to freedom of expression as guaranteed by Article 19 of the Belgian Constitution, in combination with Article 19 ICCPR and Article 10 ECHR.  The ECtHR accepts criminal sanctions for glorification of terrorist acts, but only insofar as there is a risk that such terrorist attacks will be committed, due to the public incitement at issue.  In Leroy v.  France the ECtHR referred to the circumstances that a cartoon, glorifying the 9/11 attack on the WTC in New York, was published two days after the attacks, at a time when the entire world was still in a state of shock at the news.  According to the ECtHR the impact of such a message in a politically sensitive region (the Basque region), was not to be overlooked.  It also considered that the publication of the drawing had provoked a reaction that could have stirred up violence and may well have affected public order in the region.  In its recent decision in Roj TV A/S v.  Denmark the ECTHR held that news coverage by Roj TV, with repetitive incitement to participate in fights and actions, incitement to join the organisation/the guerrilla and the portrayal of deceased guerrilla members as heroes, amounted to propaganda for the PKK as a terrorist organisation, and that it could not be considered only a declaration of sympathy.  The ECtHR refers to the findings by the High Court of Eastern Denmark, arguing explicitly that the programmes of Roj TV were to be considered as \"the promotion of the PKK's terror operation\".  The decision contrasts with the judgment in Stomahkin v.  Russia, because in the case of Roj TV v.  Denmark the ECtHR \"considers that the domestic courts carefully assessed the evidence before them and conducted a balancing exercise, which took the applicant companys right to freedom of expression into account.  The Court has not found any elements indicating that the domestic courts did not base their findings on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts\".  Application of Article 17 ECHR (abuse clause) in cases of 'hate speech? In Roj TV A/S v.  Denmark the ECtHR went however one step further, by concluding that the applicant TV station has been attempting to deflect Article 10 ECHR from its real purpose by employing the right to freedom of expression for ends which are clearly contrary to the values of the Convention.  Because the impugned TV-programmes of Roj TV promoted the PKK as a terrorist organization, the ECtHR found that, by reason of Article 17 ECHR, Roj TV could no benefit from the protection afforded by Article 10 ECHR.  It is doubtful however whether the application of Article 17 ECHR is a pertinent approach.  We have argued before that the abuse clauses application is undesirable, since it tends \"to set aside substantial principles and safeguards that are characteristic of the European speech-protective framework\" (read more here and here).  The judgment in the case of Stomakhin v.  Russia persuasively demonstrates how important it is to situate expressions of 'hate speech in their political context, to scrutinize strictly the findings by the domestic courts, especially when action is taken against 'hate speech or extremist opinions and to keep on applying the proportionality-test of Article 10 SS 2 ECHR.  The message of the ECtHR to adopt a \"cautious approach\" in cases of 'hate speech or extremist opinions that are critical for the governments policy and actions by the army or the police, is therefore very topical and crucially important in order to uphold the European standards on freedom of political expression and participation in public debate as a core value in a democratic society. ", "article_3": "Case Summary and Outcome The European Court of Human Rights found a violation of the right to freedom of expression in a case where a journalist received a five-year prison sentence and a three-year ban on practicing journalism for having published a newsletter that primarily discussed the war in Chechnya.  The Russian authorities had brought criminal proceedings against the journalist, Mr.  Stomakhin, for publishing articles that allegedly (i) appealed to extremist activities and to violence, (ii) justified and glorified terrorism, and (iii) incited hatred and enmity.  The European Court of Human Rights agreed that some of the articles had gone beyond the acceptable limits of freedom of expression.  However, it considered each impugned statement in turn to determine whether the domestic courts were justified in relying on them as the basis for Mr.  Stomakhins conviction.  In doing so, the European Court found that there was no \"pressing social need\" for the domestic courts to convict Mr.  Stomakhin for a number of statements that were levelled against the Russian government, including calls to record atrocities committed by the Russian authorities in Chechnya and a request to abstain from the presidential elections.  The Court also found that the penalty imposed was too harsh, even as a sanction for the statements that could be justifiably criminalized under Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, taking into account the limited distribution of the newsletter.  Therefore, the European Court found there to have been a violation of Mr.  Stomakhins right to freedom of expression.  Facts The case concerned Boris Vladimirovich Stomakhin, who was an activist, journalist and founder, publisher and editor-in-chief of a monthly newsletter called Radikalnaya Politika (\"Radical Politics\").  He used to publish his own articles in the newsletter, as well as articles of other people with similar views and excerpts from official and non-official sources of information and the mass media.  The articles related, to a great extent, to events in the Chechen Republic.  Between 2003 and 2004, he published a series of articles in his newsletter that gave rise to criminal proceedings against him.  In an article entitled \"From the interview given by M.  Udugov [First Deputy Prime Minister of the self-proclaimed Chechen Republic of Ichkeria (CRI)] to the Kavkaz Center press agency\", the hostage-taking at the Dubrovka Theater in Moscow in October 2002 was described as the action of \"heroic Chechen rebels\".  Another article stated that the author, who was not Mr.  Stomakhin, could understand the motivations for the hostage taking and spoke positively about the event.  In another article carrying the headline \"Insanity [defense] of Budanov [is] a guarantee of victory for [the leader of the Chechen rebel separatist movement] Basayev\", reference was made to a high-ranking Russian officer standing trial for torturing and murdering an 18-year-old Chechen woman and the finding of \"not guilty by reason of insanity\" in his case.  This article stated that the Russian army was full of \"maniacs, bloodthirsty sadists, murderers and degenerates\", and called for everyone involved with policing, the intelligence services, the military and navy (including Vladimir Putin) to be subject to mandatory psychiatric examination.  It also appealed for dozens of Chechen snipers to take up positions and kill \"aggressors\" and \"Russian invaders\".  In the same issue of the newsletter as the articles above, Mr.  Stomakhin reproduced information from the website regions. ru regarding a police operation by a unit of the regional Department of the Interior aimed at setting free Uzbek nationals who had been held in slavery by Russian nationals.  The article carried the headline \"Russians have slaves and dare to squawk something about Chechens\".  Another article was headlined \"Orthodox [believers] went completely nuts\" and talked about unidentified \"Orthodox theologians\" who, in a booklet called \"Foundations of the Orthodox Faith\", had allegedly claimed that \"Jesus Christ [had been] crucified not by Jews but by Chechens\".  In later issues, the newsletter contained articles supporting \"Chechnya at war\" and calling for Russia to be \"destroyed\".  It referred to the Moscow train bombing in 2004 as being \"justified, natural and lawful. \" It referred to Russian activities in Chechnya as amounting to genocide and called for retribution against Russia.  It spoke positively about events such as deaths of federal servicemen or law enforcement officers in the Chechen Republic, and violent attacks and assaults on public officials or police officers in parts of Russia.  Some articles urged people not to take part in the Russian elections.  Another article issued the following call: \"We have to accumulate, hate and keep record of their [Russian] crimes - the endless list of all those 'sweep operations, 'identity checks, 'counter-terrorist operations, gagging laws, unlawful searches and politically motivated criminal prosecutions.  It would also be good to make lists of all those who carried out a particular 'sweep operation in a particular village, who instituted criminal proceedings, on whose information and on which date.  It is known from the historical perspective that those people are most of all afraid of personal responsibility, which they would not be able to shift on to their commanders who had given illegal orders. \" In 2004, Mr.  Stomakhin participated to a meeting at Pushkin Square in Moscow and disseminated some issues of his newsletter.  Criminal proceedings were instituted against Mr.  Stomakhin in December 2003.  The Butyrskiy District Court of Moscow (District Court) found him guilty of \"having publicly appealed to extremist activities through the mass media\" (Article 280(2) of the Russian Criminal Code (CC)) and of having committed \"actions aimed at inciting hatred and enmity as well as at humiliating the dignity of an individual or group of individuals on the grounds of ethnicity, origin, attitude towards religion and membership of a social group, through the mass media\" (Article 282(1) CC).  [para.  45] Relying on an expert linguistic report commissioned by the prosecution, the District Court found that the impugned texts had a clear extremist leaning and incited actions prohibited by the Federal Law on Suppression of Extremist Activities.  Mr.  Stomakhin was sentenced to five-years imprisonment and was given a three-year ban on practicing journalism.  In its judgment, the District Court held that Mr.  Stomakhin had (i) called for extremist acts, such as a forcible overthrow of the constitutional order and the President of Russia; (ii) called for a breach of the territorial integrity of Russia; (iii) justified and glorified terrorist acts; (iv) called for violence against the Russian people and abased their dignity; and (v) incited religious discord by arguing that the Orthodox faith had been inferior and by insulting its followers.  It also held that Mr.  Stomakhin had used insulting language in respect of Russia as a State, the political regime in the country, and servicemen of Russias armed and security forces.  [para.  46] The District Court also observed that in various issues of his newsletter the applicant had \"intentionally appealed for records to be kept of such acts as 'sweep operations, 'identity checks, 'counter-terrorist operations, 'unlawful searches and politically motivated criminal prosecutions, which he [had] qualified as 'crimes and the persons who [had] carried them out as 'executioners in uniforms and 'narks without uniforms\".  [para.  56] On appeal, the Moscow City Court upheld Mr.  Stomakhins conviction.  It stated, in particular, that the newsletter had been a mass medium despite the low number of copies produced.  Mr.  Stomakhin was released on March 21, 2011 after he had served the prison sentence in full.  In 2007, while in prison, Mr.  Stomakhin lodged an application with the European Court of Human Rights complaining that there had been a violation of his right to freedom of expression and his right to peaceful assembly.  Mr.  Stomakhin argued, in particular, that the domestic authorities had arbitrarily expanded the list of charges on which he had been convicted by including in their number actions that had not constituted a criminal offence, such as his participation in peaceful demonstrations and meetings.  He also contended that the severity of his sentence had rendered the interference with his rights disproportionate.  He pointed out that the circulation of his newsletter had only included copies which he had printed out himself and this number was negligible.  Therefore, in his view, his actions had posed no danger to the public and should not have entailed such a severe punishment.  [para.  74] Decision Overview The European Court of Human Rights (Court) began by noting that Mr.  Stomakhins complaint mainly concerned his criminal conviction for publication and dissemination of articles that the Russian authorities had found to have contained appeals to extremist activities and to have incited hatred and enmity on various grounds.  Mr.  Stomakhins participation in unauthorized meetings had been considered only as a factual background to the dissemination of information via his newsletter.  Therefore, the Court would only examine his complaint as an alleged violation of his right to freedom of expression and not of his right to freedom of peaceful assembly.  The Court went on by stating that it was undisputed between the parties that Mr.  Stomakhins conviction amounted to an interference with his right to freedom of expression as guaranteed by Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights (Convention).  Then, it had to consider whether the interference was justified with reference to whether the interference was \"prescribed by law\", was in pursuit of a legitimate aim and, was \"necessary in a democratic society\".  The Court held that Mr.  Stomakhins conviction was prescribed by law since it was based on Articles 280 and 282 of the Russian Criminal Code.  The Court then held that Mr.  Stomakhins conviction had pursued the legitimates aims of protecting the right of others (such as the Russian people, Orthodox believers, and Russias servicemen and law enforcement), and protecting national security, territorial integrity and preventing disorder and crime.  The Court reiterated that concepts such as \"national security\" and \"public safety\" needed to be interpreted restrictively.  However, it also noted that the difficult situation in the Chechen Republic at the time of the publications required particular vigilance on the part of the authorities.  The Court went on to consider whether the interference with Mr.  Stomakhins right to freedom of expression was \"necessary in a democratic society\".  The Court reiterated that \"necessity\" implied the existence of a \"pressing social need\" and that the reasons given for the interference were \"relevant and sufficient\".  The Court also noted that the interference will only be \"necessary in a democratic society\" if it is \"proportionate\" to the legitimate aims pursued.  Turning to the facts of the present case, the Court noted that Mr.  Stomakhin was prosecuted in criminal proceedings and punished for publishing articles which, as the domestic court found, had appealed to extremist activities and to violence, justified and glorified terrorism, and incited hatred and enmity.  With this in mind, the Court reasoned that \"as a matter of principle it may be considered necessary in democratic societies to sanction or even prevent all forms of expression which spread, incite, promote or justify violence, hatred or intolerance provided that any 'formalities, 'conditions, 'restrictions or 'penalties imposed are proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.  It certainly remains open to the relevant State authorities to adopt, in their capacity as guarantors of public order, measures, even of a criminal-law nature, intended to react appropriately and without excess to such remarks.  Moreover, where such remarks incite violence against an individual, a public official or a sector of the population, the State enjoys a wider margin of appreciation when examining the need for an interference with freedom of expression\".  [para.  92] \"Pressing social need\" As on whether the interference corresponded to a \"pressing social need\" and whether the reasons adduced were relevant and sufficient, the Court first noted that the impugned statements concerned the ongoing conflict in the Chechen Republic and were undoubtedly part of a debate on a matter of public concern.  On the other hand, the Court acknowledged that the separatist tendencies in the Chechen Region had led to serious disturbances and had caused deadly terrorist attacks in other parts of Russia.  The Court considered that \"in situations of conflict and tension particular caution is called for on the part of the national authorities when consideration is being given to the publication of opinions which advocate recourse to violence against the State lest the media become a vehicle for the dissemination of hate speech and the promotion of violence.  Yet, a fair balance should be struck between the individuals fundamental right to freedom of expression and a democratic societys legitimate right to protect itself against the activities of terrorist organizations. \" [para.  96] As for Mr.  Stomakhins newsletter, the Court divided the impugned statements into three groups.  The Court found that the first group of statements promoted, justified and glorified terrorism and violence with an \"intention to romanticise and idealise the Chechen separatists cause\" and brutalize and dehumanize the federal armed and security forces by portraying them as evil.  [para.  99] The Court noted that some statements communicated to readers the general idea that recourse to violence and terrorism were necessary and justified measures of self-defense, while other statements approved of terrorist methods and violent acts.  The Court also noted that some statements accused Russian servicemen and law enforcement of serious abuses and excesses.  The Court noted that the latter accusations may not have been without foundation, particularly in the light of the Courts case-law regarding human rights violations perpetrated during the Chechen conflict.  However, the Court found that the impugned statements did not remain within the acceptable limits of freedom of expression because they stigmatized and dehumanized the other party in the conflict and, in doing so, stirred up a deep-seated and irrational hatred towards them and exposed them to a possible risk of physical violence.  [para.  107] In that respect, the Court concluded that the domestic courts interference in relation to this first group of statements had been relevant and sufficient and met a \"pressing social need\".  The second group of statements described Russian actions in Chechnya as \"genocidal war\", invited readers to record certain acts committed by Russian forces, called for certain members of the armed forces and law enforcement to undergo psychiatric examination, and asked readers to abstain from presidential elections.  The Court concluded that these statements, although virulent, did not go beyond the limits of acceptable criticism of the Russian Government and the federal armed and security forces as part of the machinery of the Russian State.  The Court reiterated that \"it is an itegral part of freedom of expression to seek historical truth, and that a debate on the causes of acts of particular gravity which may amount to war crimes or crimes against humanity should be able to take place freely. \" [para.  113] As regards the statement calling for \"an immediate compulsory psychiatric examination\" of Russias servicemen and law enforcement officers, the Court found that the domestic courts had taken this out of context.  [para.  115] The phrase formed part of an article criticizing a judicial decision that found an army officer not guilty of torturing and killing an eighteen-year-old because of temporary insanity.  In this context, the statement was a scathing criticism of this decision and was an expression of concern that a mentally unstable person had been placed in command of a regiment.  The Court could not find anything in this second group of statements that could be read as an incitement to or justification of violence, or an instigation of hatred or intolerance.  The Court stressed the importance that domestic authorities adopt a cautious approach in determining the scope of \"hate speech\" crimes and strictly construe the relevant legal provisions where such charges were brought for mere criticism of the government, State institutions or their policies and practices.  [para.  117] As the courts had failed to take account all the facts and relevant factors in relation to this second group of statements, the interference had not met \"a pressing social need\".  The third group of statements, in essence, accused ethnic Russians of keeping slaves and linked Orthodox believers to controversial statements about the death of Christ.  The Court did not depart from the conclusions of the domestic courts, which it found to be \"relevant and sufficient\" to justify the interference with Mr.  Stomakhins right to freedom of expression.  The Court reiterated that \"attacking or casting in a negative light an entire ethnic or religious group by, for instance, linking the group as a whole with a serious crime, is in contradiction with the Conventions underlying values, notably tolerance, social peace and non-discrimination. \" [para.  121] The Court did, however, criticize the domestic courts for not sufficiently specifying how some issues of the newsletter were discriminatory or humiliating towards the Orthodox religion.  Proportionality of the sanction imposed In assessing the proportionality of the interference, the Court considered the nature and severity of the penalties imposed.  The Court noted that national authorities had to exercise particular caution when the measures were such as to dissuade persons from imparting information or ideas contesting the established order of things.  In the case at hand, the Court observed that a number of statements glorified terrorism and advocated and promoted violence and hatred.  As a result, there was a need for restriction of Mr.  Stomakhins right to freedom of expression on grounds national security, territorial integrity, public safety and preventing disorder and crime.  The Court reasoned that had Mr.  Stomakhins sanction been appropriate it would have been compatible with the right to freedom of expression under Article 10 of the Convention.  However, the Court noted that Mr.  Stomakhin was sentenced to five years and banned from practicing journalism for three years.  He served the sentence in full.  The Court decided to leave open the question whether a ban on the exercise of journalistic activities is, as such, compatible with Article 10 of the Convention.  Instead, the Court acknowledged that \"a deprivation of liberty coupled with a ban on practising journalism, particularly for such a long period, for speech, even if criminal, cannot but be regarded as an extremely harsh measure warranting very convincing considerations with due regard to the particular circumstances of the case.  In the instant case, the domestic courts limited their justification of the sanctions in question with reference to the applicants 'personality and the 'social danger posed by his offence.  Whilst those considerations may be 'relevant, they cannot be regarded as 'sufficient to justify the exceptional severity of the penalty imposed on the applicant. \" [para.  129] Moreover, the Court noted that Mr.  Stomakhin had no criminal record and, therefore, the harsh sentence could not be justified on the basis of his intransigence.  The Court also assessed the proportionality of the sanction in light of the potential impact of the medium of expression concerned.  In this case, the newsletter was printed in a self-published newsletter, the number of copies was very low, and its circulation was insignificant.  With this in mind, the Court concluded that the potential impact of the impugned statements on the rights of others, national security, public safety or public order was significantly reduced.  [para. 131] The Court concluded that Mr.  Stomakhins punishment was not proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued.  In light of the above, and particularly bearing in mind the authorities failure to demonstrate convincingly the \"pressing social need\" for an interference with Mr.  Stomakhins freedom of expression in respect of a number of the impugned statements, as well as the severity of the penalty imposed on him, the Court found that the interference in question was not \"necessary in a democratic society\".  There had accordingly been a violation of Article 10 of the Convention. ", "article_4": "Boris Stomakhin has spent more than a decade testing the limits of Russia's hate-speech laws -- and being punished for it.  Twelve years after his writing first landed him in prison, he says life behind bars has taken its toll.  \"The inability to relax for a single second; the constant anticipation of trouble or at the very least unpleasantness; and the frightening, oppressive internal tension triggered by this anticipation,\" Stomakhin, 43, told RFE/RL's Russian Service in written responses from prison in Russia's Saratov region.  \"That, I suppose, is the worst, most difficult aspect of life in the prisons and penal colonies after all of these years,\" added Stomakhin, a left-wing publicist active on the margins of Russian political life for more than 20 years.  Stomakhin's incendiary antigovernment writings -- often bubbling over with radical, violent imagery -- have earned him prison sentences totaling 12 years.  He is believed to have received the most severe punishment for hate-speech and incitement-to-extremism convictions in post-Soviet Russia.  All of my thinking aloud about this government never came to fruition and could not have inflicted the least bit of harm.  It would have been smarter for them simply not to notice me. \" But amid a widening hate-speech crackdown in recent years that critics say is being used to stymie political dissent, Stomakhin is a contentious candidate to be the poster boy for the right to free expression in Russia.  Rights groups have condemned the content of his writing, in which he has endorsed \"bathing all of Russia in blood\" and carrying out \"at least one nuclear blast\" in Russia as a means of resisting authorities.  Many nonetheless denounce his lengthy incarceration, noting his health problems, the small audience for his newsletters and blog posts, and their assessment that he is not a risk to society.  \"There were no victims and no people who would have been inspired by these texts to commit violence,\" says the respected Russian rights group Memorial, which calls Stomkahin a \"likely victim\" of political repression but has not included him on its list of people it deems \"political prisoners. \" The European Court of Human Rights last month concluded that Russia violated Stomakhin's right to free expression, but also said that authorities in some instances justifiably intervened due to his statements that \"glorified terrorism and advocated and promoted violence and hatred. \" The court ordered Russia to pay Stomakhin 12,500 euros ($14,600) in damages, adding that Russia lacked \"sufficient\" justification for the \"exceptional severity\" of the five-year sentence and three-year ban on publishing for his 2006 conviction on charges of hate speech and public incitement to extremism.  The Moscow-based Sova Center, a respected monitor of the use and abuse of antiextremism legislation in Russia, has called the charges against Stomakhin in that case \"appropriate,\" while adding that it was \"perplexed\" by the harsh sentence.  A well-known Russian neo-Nazi, by comparison, received a suspended sentence in 2006 after being convicted of hate speech that involved, in part, a manual for \"street terror\" posted on his political movement's website, the Sova Center noted.  Now in his fourth year of a seven-year sentenced based on two subsequent convictions, Stomakhin says he is incarcerated \"for thoughtcrime\" -- using a term from George Orwell's dystopic novel Nineteen Eighty-Four -- \"and nothing else. \" \"All of my thinking aloud about this government never came to fruition and could not have inflicted the least bit of harm,\" Stomakhin wrote.  \"It would have been smarter for them simply not to notice me rather than crippling my life and simultaneously have their courts give me free advertising. \" 'Difficult And Agonizing' Stomakhin, who has a qualified musculoskeletal disorder due to a 2006 spine injury, calls his time in a Russian prison \"very difficult and agonizing. \" He says he has faced pressure both from fellow prisoners who \"actively pressure you, trying to force you to live by their loathsome [criminal underworld] rules,\" as well as from prison authorities who on several occasions placed him in solitary confinement using \"any pretext. \" In his current prison, Stomakhin says, guards frequently ransack his cell \"so that I can't serve out my time too easily and quietly, to rattle my nerves, and to openly bully me. \" \"There's really no practical reason for conducting these cell checks.  They've never found any banned items, and they know full well that I have no way of getting such things.  I'm alone in the cell, don't interact with anyone, and don't go anywhere other than to bathe,\" he wrote.  Asked if his political views have changed since he was targeted by authorities, Stomakhin says: \"Why would they?\" \"They have only sharpened and become more defined under the influence of books I've read in prison, as well as observations of the life that surrounds me -- if it's even appropriate to use that word,\" he wrote.  'Rather Hopeless' Stomakhin's words have resulted in at least one prison sentence and another criminal investigation for others in Russia as well.  In 2016, a court in the city of Tver sentenced engineer Andrei Bubeyev to two years in prison for reposting an article written by Stomakhin arguing that Russia illegally seized Crimea in 2014 and that the Ukrainian peninsula should be returned to Kyiv's control.  Later in 2016, a 62-year-old man was handed a two-year suspended sentence for reposting a Stomakhin article that Russian authorities had earlier deemed \"extremist\" and \"threatening to Russia's territorial integrity. \" Viktor Korb, a Russian journalist in the Siberian city of Omsk, is currently facing extremism charges for transcribing and publishing a 2015 speech that Stomakhin gave at his 2015 trial.  He faces up to seven years in prison if convicted on charges of incitement to terrorism, justification of terrorism, and terrorist propaganda.  Human Rights Watch (HRW) has criticized the case against Korb, saying that while Stomakhin's speech \"indeed contains odious, offensive views,\" the transcript is based on a publicly available YouTube video of Stomakhin's courtroom speech.  \"Nowhere in the publication does Korb express support of what Stomakhin said in his speech,\" HRW researcher Vladislav Lobanov wrote last month.  Stomakhin, whose mother died last year, is pessimistic about life after prison.  The case against Korb \"unfortunately makes my prospects after my release from my current term even more nebulous,\" Stomakhin wrote.  \"If I stay in Russia, it's inevitable that they will imprison me again,\" he wrote.  \"Overall, my future after this prison term looks like a dead end and appears to me to be rather hopeless. \"", "article_5": "Boris Vladimirovich Stomakhin (Russian: Boris Vladimirovich Stomakhin) (born August 24, 1974, Moscow) is a Russian radical political activist, and editor of \"Radical politics\" periodical.  He was convicted to five years in prison on charges of inciting ethnic hatred and making public appeals for extremist activity.  The conviction is questioned by human rights protection organizations ARTICLE 19, Committee to Protect Journalists, and Union of Councils for Soviet Jews.  Journalism and political activism Stomakhin was a member of Maoist Revolutionary Workers Party.  Later he became a leader of a radical political group \"Revolutionary Contact Association\" (RCA).  Since 2000, Boris Stomakhin was an editor of the monthly newspaper \"Radical Politics\".  In addition, he contributed numerous materials to Kavkaz Center, the radical Islamic internet agency that promotes the independence of Chechnya and is maintained by Chechen separatists.  Boris Stomakhin's statements were interpreted as public calls for the mass murder of Russians.  Ethnic Russians must be killed, and only killed - there are no normal people among them.  To kill, to kill, to kill! To flood all Russia in blood, to show no mercy for anyone, to try by all means to organize an nuclear weapons explosion on the territory of the Russian Federation, - this must be the plan of radical Resistance, Russian, Chechen, any one! The Russian court established that Stomakhin called for the violent overthrow of government and claimed that Russian troops in Chechnya are \"occupiers\" and compared President Vladimir Putin to Saddam Hussein and Slobodan Milosevic.  According to his court sentence, Stomakhin also stated that modern Russia is an Evil empire and therefore must be destroyed, and considered Shamil Basaev and Salman Raduev as heroes of the Chechen resistance whose terrorist activities are legitimate.  Valeria Novodvorskaya and Yakov Krotov, prominent human rights activists believe that he did not promote any terrorist activities, calling him a \"political prisoner\", and \"not an extremist\".  Opening of a criminal case against Stomakhin Attempts to prosecute Stomakhin for hate speech were made unsuccessfully in 2000.  Successful application to prosecute Stomakhin was made by opposition Communist Party State Duma member Viktor Zorkaltsev at the request of another Communist party member Valentina Lavrova.  Valentina Lavrova has acquired a copy of Stomakhin Radical Politics periodical, while being on rally in Mayakovsky Square, Moscow, in September 2002.  Being insulted by the text of periodicals she hasn't rushed immediately to authorities, and began to collect the evidence by visiting public actions of Stomakhin and acquiring new numbers of his periodical.  After collecting the evidence she referred not to police or security authorities, but to the member of parliament, Viktor Zorkaltsev.  Stomakhin's home was searched in April 2004 and his computers and books were confiscated.  Stomakhin fled to Ukraine seeking political asylum, which was eventually denied.  Arrest and trial Having returned to Moscow, Stomakhin was arrested on March 21, 2006.  Stomakhin tried to escape during his arrest and fell down from fourth floor of his building, according to his lawyer Alexei Golubev and news reports.  His spine and bones were broken as a result.  Stomakhin was subsequently interrogated.  Psychiatry experts at the Moscow Serbsky Institute found that Stomakhin was competent to stand trial.  He was sentenced to five years of prison for inciting hatred and defamatory statements aimed at groups and persons of particular religious and ethnic background and for promoting violent change of constitutional regime and violation of territorial integrity of Russian Federation (articles 280 and 282 of the Russian Criminal Code).  Below are some excerpts from Stomakhin's articles cited as incriminating evidence in the court sentence: \"Let tens of new Chechen snipers take their positions in the mountain ridges and the city ruins and let hundreds, thousands of aggressors fall under righteous bullets! No mercy! Death to the Russian occupiers!\" (the article was written in response to rape and murder of Chechen women Elza Kungaeva by Yuri Budanov) \"We, 'Revolutionary Contact Association' and 'Radical Politics' are united with the Committee 2008 and are ready to cooperate with it.  However we [are] a lot more radical.  We are for not waiting until 2008 and bothering ourselves particularly with the Constitution, but we are for calling people to overthrow the Putin's regime as soon as possible.  And we do not see any possibility of preserving Russian Federation as a single state.  But we are ready to unite with all allies, even those that are more moderate\".  \"Bombing in Moscow subway was justified, natural and legal. . .  The Chechens have full moral right to blow up anything they want in Russia after all that Russia and Russians did to them, none objections on humanism and philanthropy could be accepted. \" \"All Chechnya is currently filled up with the same Budanovs, maniacs, blood lusting sadists, murderers and degenerates with epaulets .  The entire Russian occupation army consists of such Budanovs\".  \"In Chechnya Russian army ceased to exist as a military structure of state, being transformed into a devilish gang of marauders and killers, the gang intoxicated from narcotics\".  \"Precisely the bloody, cannibalistic ferocity of this state against a small and defenceless mountain nation was the first to inspire our mind with this thought: Russia must be destroyed forever, a state that allows itself to do such things to entire nations must not exist at all!\" \"The Chechen heroes are going.  Dudayev, Atteriyev, Khattab, and today - Raduyev.  It is as if they are being devoured, swallowed by a terrible, black malodorous abyss.  The name of that abyss is Russia.  Russia's immeasurable baseness and perfidy, her pathological dishonesty and criminality as a country, a civilization, a historical agent. \" Stomakhin pleaded not guilty.  Stomakhin was periodically laughing when the judge was reading his sentence.  In five years after his arrest on 21 March 2011 Somakhin was released from jail.  Commentaries Support Alexander Litvinenko said that \"people like Boris are the most dangerous for the Putin's regime that deceived millions of Russians, brought them to their knees and transformed them to slaves\".  According to priest Yakov Krotov, \"Stomakin made a picture of Putin with swastika? Well, I believe that not only Putin and his generals deserve to wear swastika, but also all Russian civilians who pretend that they know nothing about the genocide of Chechens and discrimination of Georgians in Russia\" Stomakhin was qualified as a prisoner of conscience\" by the Union of Councils for Soviet Jews and as a political prisoner in an open letter send to G7 leaders by Russia's human rights activists Sergei Kovalev, Yelena Bonner.  A group of Russian citizens including Vladimir Bukovsky condemned the conviction of Stomakhin as prosecution of free speech.  Widow of Andrei Sakharov Elena Bonner compared Stomakhin with Soviet dissidents who were prosecuted for their writings by Yuri Andropov.  Human rights activist Svetlana Gannushkina and politician Valeria Novodvorskaya argued that Stomakhin's writings while being \"absolutely outrageous\" and \"inciting national hatred\" had not been a public threat: they were very unlikely to incite anybody Journalist Vladimir Abarinov criticized court proceedings as an example of kangaroo court He claimed that the criminal case against Stomakhin was opened based on solely an article about Russian Orthodox Church that was not written by Stomakhin.  It was decided by the court that Stomakhin actually copied this article from a Live Journal entry, as well as other publications of numerous news agencies.  The authors of the original work disagree to share their responsibility with Stomakhin citing that he had reproduced their works without permission and distorted the original meaning.  Criticism Some journalists like M.  Smolin from Komsomolskaya Pravda described his views as extremely Russophobic.  Critics of the court decision were denounced by Russian pro-government publicist Maxim Sokolov.  In his article published in Izvestia newspaper after the conviction of Stomakhin he remarked that Stomakhin's writings were worse than Mein Kampf by Adolf Hitler and that the hate speech must be prosecuted according to the article 282 of the Russian criminal code.  He cited in support a text written by Boris Stomakhin, that \"Russian Federation and Russians must be exterminated\" by all available means including Nuclear bomb, because all Russians are collectively responsible for actions of their government with respect to Chechen people.  According to Sokolov, the cited passage made application of the article 282 completely appropriate.  External links"}}

She made her theatrical debut in 1947, and established herself as one of the leading actresses of the Comedie-Francaise.  Moreau began playing small roles in films in 1949, later achieving prominence with starring roles in Louis Malle's Elevator to the Gallows (1958), Michelangelo Antonioni's La Notte (1961), and Francois Truffaut's Jules et Jim (1962).  Most prolific during the 1960s, Moreau continued to appear in films into her 80s.  Orson Welles called her \"the greatest actress in the world\". She won the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actress for Seven Days. . .  Seven Nights (1960), the BAFTA Award for Best Foreign Actress for Viva Maria! (1965), and the Cesar Award for Best Actress for The Old Lady Who Walked in the Sea (1992).  She was also the recipient of several lifetime achievement awards, including a BAFTA Fellowship in 1996, a Cannes Golden Palm in 2003, and another Cesar Award in 2008. Moreau was born in Paris, the daughter of Katherine (nee Buckley), a dancer who performed at the Folies Bergere (d.  1990), and Anatole-Desire Moreau, a restaurateur (d.  1975). Moreau's father was French; her mother was English, a native of Oldham, Lancashire, England and of part Irish descent. Moreau's father was Catholic and her mother, originally a Protestant, converted to Catholicism upon marriage. When Jeanne was a young girl, \"the family moved south to Vichy, spending vacations at the paternal ancestral village of Mazirat, a town of 30 houses in a valley in the Allier.  \"It was wonderful there\", Moreau said.  \"Every tombstone in the cemetery was for a Moreau\".  During World War II, the family was split, and Moreau lived with her mother in Paris.  Moreau ultimately lost interest in school and, at age 16, after attending a performance of Jean Anouilh's Antigone, found her calling as an actor.  She later studied at the Conservatoire de Paris.  Her parents separated permanently while Moreau was at the conservatory and her mother, \"after 24 difficult years in France, returned to England with Jeanne's sister, Michelle. In 1947, Moreau made her theatrical debut at the Avignon Festival.  She debuted at the Comedie-Francaise in Ivan Turgenev's A Month in the Country and, by her 20s, was already one of the leading actresses in the theatre's troupe. After 1949, she began appearing in films with small parts but continued primarily active in the theatre for several years -- a year at the Theatre National Populaire opposite among others Gerard Philipe and Robert Hirsch, then a breakout two years in dual roles in The Dazzling Hour by Anna Bonacci, then Jean Cocteau's La Machine Infernale and others before another two-year run, this time in Shaw's Pygmalion. From the late 1950s, after appearing in several successful films, she began to work with the emerging generation of French film-makers.  Elevator to the Gallows (1958) with first-time director Louis Malle was followed by Malle's The Lovers (Les Amants, 1959). Moreau went on to work with many of the best known New Wave and avant-garde directors. Francois Truffaut's New Wave film Jules et Jim (1962), her biggest success internationally, is centered on her magnetic starring role. She also worked with a number of other notable directors such as Michelangelo Antonioni (La notte and Beyond the Clouds), Orson Welles (The Trial, Chimes at Midnight and The Immortal Story), Luis Bunuel (Diary of a Chambermaid), Elia Kazan (The Last Tycoon), Rainer Werner Fassbinder (Querelle), Wim Wenders (Until the End of the World), Carl Foreman (Champion and The Victors), and Manoel de Oliveira (Gebo et l'Ombre).  In 1983, she was head of the jury at the 33rd Berlin International Film Festival. In 2005, she was awarded with the Stanislavsky Award at the 27th Moscow International Film Festival. Moreau was also a vocalist.  She released several albums and once performed with Frank Sinatra at Carnegie Hall in 1984. In addition to acting, Moreau worked behind the camera as a writer, director and producer. Her accomplishments were the subject of the film Calling the Shots (1988) by Janis Cole and Holly Dale. [citation needed] She appeared in Rosa von Praunheim's film Fassbinder's Women (2000). Moreau in 2009 Throughout her life, Moreau maintained friendships with prominent writers such as Jean Cocteau, Jean Genet, Henry Miller, and Marguerite Duras, (an interview with Moreau is included in Duras's book Outside: Selected Writings).  She formerly was married to Jean-Louis Richard (1949-1964, separated in 1951), and then to American film director William Friedkin (1977-1979).  She and Richard had a son, Jerome. Director Tony Richardson left his wife Vanessa Redgrave for her in 1967, but they never married. She also had relationships with directors Louis Malle and Francois Truffaut, fashion designer Pierre Cardin, and the Greek actor/playboy Theodoros Roubanis. In 1971, Jeanne Moreau was a signatory of the Manifesto of the 343 which publicly announced that she had obtained an illegal abortion. Moreau was a close friend of Sharon Stone, who presented a 1998 American Academy of Motion Pictures life tribute to Moreau at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater, academy headquarters, in Beverly Hills.  Orson Welles called her \"the greatest actress in the world\", and she remained one of France's most accomplished actresses.  In 2009, Moreau signed a petition in support of director Roman Polanski, who had been detained while traveling to a film festival in relation to his 1977 sexual abuse charges, which the petition argued would undermine the tradition of film festivals as a place for works to be shown \"freely and safely\", and that arresting filmmakers traveling to neutral countries could open the door \"for actions of which no-one can know the effects. \" Moreau died on 31 July 2017 at her home in Paris at the age of 89. Her body was discovered by her cleaning maid and shortly before her death, she said she felt \"abandoned\".

Already a successful stage actor when she came to international attention for her turn in Louis Malles moody thriller ELEVATOR TO THE GALLOWS, Moreau soon went on to cement her status as an icon of the French New Wave with her role as the mercurial free spirit at the center of Francois Truffauts JULES AND JIM.  Throughout her six-decade career, Moreau delivered fearless performances for some of the leading auteurs of her time, including Michelangelo Antonioni (LA NOTTE), Jacques Demy (BAY OF ANGELS), and Orson Welles (CHIMES AT MIDNIGHT), who proclaimed her \"the greatest actress in the world. \"", "article_2": "Jeanne Moreau is an icon of the French cinema who also experienced a streak of success as a vocalist during the 1960s.  Born on January 23, 1928, in Paris, she broke into the film industry during the 1950s, appearing most notably in a pair of 1958 films by Louis Malle, Ascenseur Pour l'Echafaud and Les Amants.  Following her breakthrough success in these films, she appeared in a long line of others by prominent directors, most notably Francois Truffaut, who immortalized her in his classic Jules et Jim (1962), as well as Jean-Luc Godard (A Woman Is a Woman, 1961), Michelangelo Antonioni (La Notte, 1961), Orson Welles (The Trial, 1962), Luis Bunuel (Diary of a Chambermaid, 1964), Rainer Werner Fassbinder (Querelle, 1982), and Wim Wenders (Until the End of the World, 1991).  Moreau's recording career as a vocalist was sparked by her memorable performance of the song \"Le Tourbillon\" in Jules et Jim.  Released as a 45-rpm single by Philips in 1962, \"Le Tourbillon\" was written by Cyrus Bassiak (born Serge Rezvani).  The full-length album Jeanne Moreau (1963), comprised of a dozen songs by Rezvani, was released on the Disques Jacques Canetti label in the wake of \"Le Tourbillon. \" Subsequent silver-screen singing performances of note include the songs \"Embrasse-Moi,\" a Bassiak song from the film Peau de Banane (1963), and \"Ah les P'tites Femmes de Femmes de Paris,\" a duet with Brigitte Bardot from the film Viva Maria (1965).  There was also another full-length album of Bassiak songs released on Disques Jacques Canetti, 12 Chansons (1966).  Moreau's two full-lengths were later compiled by the British label El on The Immortal Jeanne Moreau (2008).  Numerous other best-of collections were compiled over the years, most of them featuring soundtrack recordings such as \"Le Tourbillon\" alongside material from her full-lengths.  ~ Jason Birchmeier, Rovi", "article_3": "Jeanne Moreau, the sensual, gravel-voiced actress who became the face of the New Wave, Frances iconoclastic mid-20th-century film movement, most notably in Francois Truffauts \"Jules and Jim,\" died on Monday at her home in Paris.  She was 89.  Her death was confirmed by the office of President Emmanuel Macron.  Ms.  Moreau, whom journalists liked to call the thinking moviegoers femme fatale, first came to American audiences attention in Louis Malles 1958 drama \"The Lovers. \" The film included a lengthy love scene in which Ms.  Moreau, playing a bored housewife having an affair, enacted a clearly orgasmic moment, considered scandalous at the time.  It was four years later, in \"Jules and Jim,\" that she became a full-fledged international star, playing Catherine, the capricious, destructive object of Oskar Werner and Henri Serres desire in a doomed menage a trois. ", "article_4": "With her sensual, pouting mouth, her Gauloises-saturated voice, and her combination of sharp intelligence and smouldering sexuality, Jeanne Moreau, who has died aged 89, seemed to many the embodiment of French womanhood.  Although by the early 1950s she was established on stage, Moreau achieved screen stardom only with her 20th film, Louis Malles first solo feature, Lift to the Scaffold (1958), as an actor who represented the spirit of emerging feminism.  Her status was consolidated in Malles The Lovers, released later the same year, and reached a peak as Moreau, queen of the French New Wave, took the role of Catherine, object of the affections of the best friends of the title in Francois Truffauts Jules et Jim (1961).  According to the critic Derek Malcolm: \"Moreau was the perfect choice for Catherine: she gives a performance full of gaiety and charm without conveying an empty-headed bimbo.  She makes the watcher understand that this is no ordinary woman whom both men adore.  It is possibly the most complete portrait of any feminine character in the entire oeuvre of the New Wave. \" Although Moreau seemed the archetypical French woman, she was half English; her mother, Kathleen Buckley, was a Lancashire lass, from Oldham.  Kathleen was one of the high-stepping Tiller Girls, and it was while she was performing at the Folies Bergere in Paris that she met Anatole Moreau, a cafe owner.  Kathleen became pregnant, they married, and their daughter Jeanne was born in Montmartre.  \"Im very proud of being half English and I think as time passes my best English qualities are more and more visible,\" remarked Moreau.  \"Im pleased I can be outrageous as only the English can be. \" If being outrageous meant being her own woman, expressing her opinions unreservedly and having a number of well-publicised affairs, then she lived up to the epithet.  At first she wanted to be a dancer like her mother, but a visit to the Comedie-Francaise to see Marie Bell as Phedre changed all that.  \"That was passion.  Being in the audience I felt, even the first time, that my place wasnt there in the dark.  I didnt feel like being the one who just watches.  I wasnt born for obscurity.  I knew at once I wanted to be an actress.  It was not a money or a fame thing but an escape from real life.  I lost all interest in school. \" When Jeanne told her father of her ambition, he called her a whore, but her mother supported her, and she entered the Conservatoire National Superieur dArt Dramatique at the age of 18.  (Jeannes father became reconciled to his daughters profession only a few years before he died in 1975. ) In her final year at the Conservatoire, Moreau was approached by Jean Vilar, who was organising the first Avignon theatre festival, to play Verochka in A Month in the Country.  As a result of this performance, she was given a four-year contract at the Comedie-Francaise.  A fellow member of the company was the actor-director-screenwriter Jean-Louis Richard, whom she married in 1948, a few months before their son Jerome was born.  Two years later, the couple separated, although Richard subsequently directed her in two films: Mata Hari, Agent H21 (1965) and Dianes Body (1969).  After leaving the Comedie-Francaise in 1952, she rejoined Vilar at the Theatre National Populaire, playing opposite the matinee idol Gerard Philipe in Le Cid and The Prince of Homburg.  (She would later co-star with him in Roger Vadims 1959 updated film version of Les Liaisons Dangereuses. ) Other stage triumphs were as the Sphinx in Jean Cocteaus La Machine Infernale, with Jean Marais as Oedipus; Eliza Doolittle in Pygmalion, directed by Marais; and Maggie in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, directed by Peter Brook.  It was in the last of these that she was seen by the 25-year-old tyro film director Malle, who was determined to star her in Lift to the Scaffold.  Previously she had made so little impact, in superficial roles in a series of commercial pictures, excepting her call-girl dancer in Jacques Beckers Touchez Pas au Grisbi (Honour Among Thieves, 1954), that many believed it to be her first.  Lift to the Scaffold was a vividly photographed, darkly atmospheric thriller in which Moreau glowed as a woman plotting with her lover to kill her husband.  \"We didnt hide Jeannes face in cosmetics,\" Malle explained, \"but allowed her to be herself.  After years of having makeup artists covering up her looks in a desperate attempt to force her to conform, suddenly she became a real woman. \" According to Malle, they had \"a great love affair\".  In The Lovers, Moreau was wonderful as the bored provincial wife finding sexual gratification outside marriage.  But the nature of the controversial film, with its semi-nude love scenes, was one of the causes of the end of the affair.  \"Louis could no longer stand to see me as others then saw me, and as only he had seen me until then,\" Moreau explained.  \"I knew that if I played the love scenes just as Louis wanted, he would love me as an actress but hate me as a woman.  I could not play them without betraying him. \" However, they remained good friends for the rest of their lives, and Malle directed Moreau in two further films, Le Feu Follet (The Fire Within, 1963) and Viva Maria! (1965), the latter co-starring Brigitte Bardot.  In 1960, Moreau played another bored and frustrated wife in Brooks Moderato Cantabile (Seven Days . . .  Seven Nights), written by her friend Marguerite Duras, for which she won the best actress award at Cannes.  She then refused the Jean Simmons role in Spartacus to work with Michelangelo Antonioni in La Notte (1961), but \"there was no communication between Antonioni and me\".  Nevertheless, she was effective as a woman facing the emptiness of her life as, in the best sequence, she wanders the streets of Milan for hours.  But it was Truffaut who dispelled the gloom, making Moreau smile again as the skittish Catherine in Jules et Jim.  She not only sings Le Tourbillon delightfully, but also brilliantly captures the mood swings of this complex woman.  One of the most memorable freewheeling sequences comes when Moreau as Catherine dresses up as a man whom she names Thomas, puts on a fake moustache, and races her two lovers across a bridge.  This was followed by an equally complex femme fatale role in Joseph Loseys Eva (1962).  She had begun a five-year relationship with the fashion designer Pierre Cardin, who designed many of her clothes on and off screen.  Although he was gay, the couple were seen everywhere together and there was speculation that they would marry.  Meanwhile, she continued to work with many of the worlds best directors.  She was a compulsive gambler in Jacques Demys Bay of Angels (1962); a seductive Miss Burstner in her friend Orson Welless The Trial (1962); and was splendidly unscrupulous in Luis Bunuels Diary of a Chambermaid (1964), allowing her boots to be kissed by her foot-fetishist boss.  The critics also genuflected for her performances in the above films, though they were justifiably less laudatory about her roles in the few big commercial films she appeared in, such as Carl Foremans rambling war film The Victors (1963), John Frankenheimers The Train (1964), in which she is a widowed hotel owner who has a romantic tryst with a French resistance leader (Burt Lancaster) on the run from the Nazis, and The Yellow Rolls-Royce (1964) where, at Ascot, in a Cardin suit, she betrays her wealthy husband (Rex Harrison) in the eponymous vehicle with his underling (Edmund Purdom).  Then there were two bizarre flops, directed by Tony Richardson.  Mademoiselle (1966), with a script by Jean Genet, had Moreau as a village schoolteacher who goes off at night setting fire to barns, and poisoning the water of the livestock.  In one scene, which few other actresses could have got away with, she gets down on her knees, bays like a dog and licks the muddy boots of her lover, an Italian workman.  In The Sailor from Gibraltar (1967), based on Duras, she played a mysterious woman, sailing the seas in her yacht in search of the sailor of the title.  Also in the film, as a ditched wife, was Vanessa Redgrave, then married to Richardson.  Life imitated art when Redgrave divorced Richardson, citing Moreau as co-respondent.  Moreau worked with Welles again on four films, two of them, The Deep and The Other Side of the Wind, left unfinished.  In Chimes at Midnight (1966), she was a lively Doll Tearsheet, and the fulfilment of a sailors dream in The Immortal Story (1968), almost convincing him (and us) that she was 17.  In Truffauts Hitchcock-inspired The Bride Wore Black (1968), Moreau was supremely in command as a meticulous avenging angel, seducing and then eliminating all the men who shot her husband on her wedding day.  For Jean Renoir, who described her as \"probably the actress I admire most\", she provided a musical interlude between episodes of Le Petit Theatre de Jean Renoir (1971), singing Quand LAmour Meurt in a high, small but affecting voice.  Jeanne Moreau both directed and acted in Lumiere (1976).  Photograph: The Ronald Grant Archive In 1974, she returned to the stage, at the Espace Cardin in Paris, in Ride Across Lake Constance by Peter Handke, in a cast that included Gerard Depardieu and Delphine Seyrig.  After a brief affair with the playwright, and films with Losey (Mr Klein, 1976) and Elia Kazan (The Last Tycoon, 1976), Moreau married the director William Friedkin in 1977.  They had met a few years earlier when he was in France scouting locations for The French Connection.  They lived in the US until their divorce two years later.  \"That marriage with Bill was an extraordinary experience, extremely painful and violent, but Im happy I went through it,\" Moreau said.  She directed two well-made, but essentially old-fashioned films, Lumiere (1976), about actors, and The Adolescent (1979), which drew on her late childhood during the occupation.  In Rainer Werner Fassbinders last film, Querelle (1982), based on Genet, Moreau somehow managed to keep risibility at bay as the rapacious Madame Lysiane, owner of a brothel, who warbles the monotonous song Everybody Kills the Thing He Loves.  She appeared on British television: in Vicious Circle (1985, an adaptation of Jean-Paul Sartres Huis Clos), making an impact as the lesbian Ines; in The Clothes in the Wardrobe (1993), as a free-spirited woman bringing colour into a dull English family; and in A Foreign Field (also in 1993), as the old flame of a war veteran (Leo McKern).  She also continued to bring her heady combination of passion and intelligence to bear on films from a new generation of French directors, such as Luc Bessons Nikita (1990), in which she had a supporting role as an instructor at a government \"killing school\" who teaches the young secret service assassin (Anne Parillaud) to be \"first a human being then a woman\".

Photograph: Miguel Villagran/AP Few screen actors could match Moreau in the longevity of her allure, demonstrated in The Old Lady Who Walks in the Sea (1991), in which she was a witty and lecherous con artist; in Cet Amour-La (2001), in which she impersonated Duras; in Francois Ozons Time to Leave (Le Temps Qui Reste, 2005), as a sympathetic confidante to her dying gay grandson; and in Manoel de Oliveiras Gebo and the Shadow (Gebo et LOmbre, 2012), in which she delivered an amusing cameo.  \"People - especially women - worry so much about ageing,\" she said when she was in her 70s.  \"But I tell you, you look younger if you dont worry about it.  Because beyond the beauty, the sex, the titillation, the surface, there is a human being.  And that has to emerge. \" Moreau is survived by her son. "}}

In this Spanish name , the first or paternal surname isand the second or maternal family name is Santiago Segura Silva (born 17 July 1965) is a Spanish filmmaker and actor.  He also worked to a lesser extent as a television presenter, voice actor and comic book writer, as well as being a collector of original comic books.  At 12, he began making films with a Super-8 camera, and, after a recommendation from Fernando Trueba, began to make films in 35 mm, funded by his appearances in TV game shows.  He earned early recognition for his performance as a metalhead in 1995 film The Day of the Beast (billed as a \"satanic comedy\"), which won him the Goya Award for Best New Actor.  Great success would come with his directorial feature debut, 1998 dark action comedy and box-office hit Torrente, the Dumb Arm of the Law, in which he stars as Jose Luis Torrente, a racist, homophobic, xenophobic, and fascist former police cop. The film, that won Segura the Goya Award for Best New Director, was followed by four sequels (Torrente 2: Mission in Marbella, Torrente 3: El protector, Torrente 4: Lethal Crisis and Torrente 5: Operacion Eurovegas) that made the highest-grossing Spanish film series.  He then went on to direct films with a lighter tone, likewise churning domestic box-office hits with children comedies such as Father There Is Only One (and its two sequels) and The Kids Are Alright. Santiago Segura Silva was born in Madrid on 17 July 1965. He was raised in the city's district of Carabanchel. After studying Arts at the Complutense University of Madrid, he decided to pursue a career as a filmmaker and in 1989 he directed the short Relatos de medianoche with a budget of 7000 pesetas (around US$50).  In 1992 he went on to direct his first professional short Evilio, followed with Perturbado in 1993.  Segura is a recurring actor in the works of directors Alex de la Iglesia and Guillermo del Toro.  In 1993, he had a small role in Alex de la Iglesia's film Accion mutante.  Two years later, he starred in El dia de la Bestia, from the same director and that role made him famous in Spain. In 1998 he directed the film that brought him to stardom, Torrente: El brazo tonto de la ley (1998), in which he also acted as the lead character Jose Luis Torrente, a sleazy crime-fighter. Its popularity led to a sequel (Torrente 2: Mision en Marbella) and a computer game (Torrente: El juego). Torrente 2: Mision en Marbella made EUR22,838,500 at the Spanish box office, becoming the highest grossing Spanish film of all time. Torrente 3: El protector, the third film in the series, was released in September 2005.  Its advertising campaign parodied Batman Begins, using the phrase \"Torrente Acabado\" (\"Torrente Finished\").  Although he declared Torrente 3: El protector would be the last of the Torrente series, Torrente 4 was released in 2011. In 2010, he played the title role in El gran Vazquez, based on the life of the legendary cartoonist/wastrel Manuel Vazquez Gallego. In 2014 he released Torrente 5: Operacion Eurovegas with Alec Baldwin as guest star, and was the top release of 2014 in Spain. He has since made his way into American culture by making appearances in movies such as Pacific Rim, Hellboy, Hellboy II: The Golden Army and Blade II (all of them by Del Toro), Perdita Durango (by De la Iglesia), Jack and Jill and Agent Cody Banks 2: Destination London.  He has also dubbed video games to Spanish, like Jack Black's role in Brutal Legend. Because of his success, Santiago Segura has become a producer. He owns Amiguetes Entertainment company, he is associated with the theater in Estacion del Norte in Madrid, and has produced Promedio rojo (2004) (featuring Nicolas Lopez) and Aqui mando yo. . .  y punto com. In 2018 he appeared in the third season of MasterChef Celebrity. He was the 10th contestant to be eliminated.

He broke out first as an actor in 1995 with a leading turn in the horror comedy \"The Day of the Beast,\" which took film festivals by storm, garnering over a dozen awards in all.  Having made several short films prior to \"The Day of the Beast,\" Segura embarked on his first feature-length film, released in 1998: \"Torrente, el brazo tonto de la ley. \" The film brought Segura a Best New Director nod at the Goya Awards, Spain's national film honors, and was so successful that it spawned three sequels and a video game.  All of them were wildly popular and all starred Segura in the lead role as misanthropic ex-cop Jose Luis Torrente.  A friend of Mexican filmmaker Guillermo del Toro, Segura had cameos in del Toro's comic-book adaptations \"Hellboy\" and \"Hellboy II. \" He has also appeared in the futuristic vampire flick \"Blade II\" (again, directed by del Toro) and the spy comedy \"Agent Cody Banks 2: Destination London. \" In 1994, Segura founded his own production company, Amiguetes Entertainment, which has overseen several of his films.

Caron was born on 17 November 1857 at Monnerville and studied at the Paris Conservatoire, but was not taken on at the Paris Opera; her husband, an accompanist, encouraged her to take lessons from Marie Sasse who helped her to get engagements at the opera in Brussels (having made her concert debut in 1880). Her first operatic appearance in Brussels was as Alice in Meyerbeer's Robert le Diable, followed by Salome in Massenet's Herodiade and Marguerite in Gounod's Faust; noticed by Ernest Reyer, he chose her to create the role of Brunehild in Sigurd in 1884 (and the Paris premiere in 1885).  In 1888, she created the role of Laurence in Benjamin Godard's Jocelyn at La Monnaie de Munt in Brussels.  The title role in Reyer's Salammbo (1890) was also created by Caron in Brussels. In 1885 she began singing at the Paris Opera, where she became the chief rival of Lucienne Breval. Caron was the first in Paris to sing Desdemona in Verdi's Otello.  Her repertoire included several Wagnerian roles, including Sieglinde in Die Walkure, as well as Rachel in Halevy's La Juive and Valentine in Meyerbeer's Les Huguenots.  At the Opera-Comique she sang Leonore in Beethoven's Fidelio (in 1898) and the title roles in Gluck's Iphigenie en Tauride and Orphee. Caron sang in the first performance of Debussy's L'enfant prodigue on 27 July 1884, as part of the composition competition of the Prix de Rome in Paris.  Caron sang a few times with the Societe des Concerts du Conservatoire: in December 1885/January 1886, she performed airs from Der Freischutz by Weber and La vestale by Spontini; at the official concert of the Exposition Universelle on 20 June 1889, fragments from Ambroise Thomas's Psyche and excerpts from Reyer's Sigurd; and in March 1895, scenes from Gluck's Alceste. She also sang Marguerite in the stage premiere of Berlioz's La damnation de Faust at Monte Carlo in 1893. After 1895, she reduced her public appearances considerably and concentrated on teaching at the Paris Conservatoire (1904-09) and then as a private tutor.  One of her pupils was soprano Alice Zeppilli.  She left a few recordings dating from 1903 and 1904, for French Fonotipia, that were recorded poorly, and show her past her prime. During her lifetime, Caron was linked with French statesman Theophile Delcasse and the Prime Minister of France Georges Clemenceau. She died in Paris, aged 72, and was buried at Monnerville Cemetery. As Marguerite in Gounod's Faust for the gala 1,000th performance at the Paris Opera on 14 December 1894 Rose Caron, by Reutlinger, circa 1905 In Lohengrin, by Wilhelm Benque , 7 January 1893", "article_1": "I love this rose; it's one of my favorite single note rose fragrances.  It's easy to think \"why do I need to even smell another rose fragrance?\" But this one is different.  It starts out for maybe 15 seconds smelling like a lot of light rose scents, but immediately I get a blast of what seems almost wetness, which must be the aloe vera.  (Decades ago when I tried to go hiking, I actually grew aloe vera to apply directly to the poison oak on my skin, so it's hard to think of aloe vera being added to perfume. ) Other rose scents don't have this wet effect, and don't give aloe vera as a note, so the aloe vera must be what causes it.  What also makes this Caron Rose so different is the vetyver.  It's not heavy handed or wintry either, but it adds an element you're not expecting that turns this light little rose into a complex fragrance.  I love geranium scents and I know I was expecting more geranium in this, but I just don't smell it.  To my nose anyway, beyond the bevy of roses, this is a vetyver, iris, sandalwood and vanilla scent.  It lasts 6+ hours on my skin.  The perfume I'm describing here was not made in 1949, but it's in a bottle that is identical to the one in the picture, where the box is mainly pink with a green leaves design at the bottom.  I believe this edition came out around 1999-2000, and I probably bought my bottle of it around 2003.  I had a prior bottle of it that was a lay-down spray bottle I bought I think in Paris in 1993; the juice in it smelled the same.  The 1949 edition I'm sure was a parfum, not an edp, and I don't know if the juice was the same as this.  There is an implication that this Caron Rose was in continual production between 1949 and now, but I'm not sure this is true.  I wore a lot of Caron scents between 1968-2010, and certainly lurked at a lot of Caron counters, including those that had urns, like I.  Magnin in San Francisco.  But I don't remember seeing this Rose scent until I bought that bottle in 1993 in Paris, probably in the flagship store on Ave.  Montaigne, that had Caron scents other stores didn't have.  I bring all this up because I have no idea what or whether what Caron may now be selling called Rose is the same as what I have.  I think the one in the pink box with the green leaves is still around online, and that's the one I advise.

His work spans a variety of forms and genres, including novels, essays, children's books, screenplays, theatre and comics.  His novel Texaco was awarded the Prix Goncourt in 1992. Chamoiseau was born on 3 December 1953 in Fort-de-France, Martinique, where he resides.  After he studied law in Paris, he returned to Martinique, inspired by Edouard Glissant to take a close interest in Creole culture.  In 1981, he was the co-author, with Georges Puisy, of a historical work on the Antilles under the reign of Napoleon Bonaparte, Delgres : les Antilles sous Bonaparte.  In 1989, he was the co-author of Eloge de la creolite (In Praise of Creoleness) with Jean Bernabe and Raphael Confiant.  Chamoiseau has received several awards.  In 1990, he received the Prix Carbet for Antan d'enfance, the first book in an autobiographical trilogy collectively titled Une enfance creole. His 1992 novel Texaco has been described as \"a masterpiece, the work of a genius, a novel that deserves to be known as much as Fanon's The Wretched of the Earth and Cesaire's Return to My Native Land. \" In 1999, Chamoiseau was honoured with a Prince Claus Award for his contribution to Caribbean society.  Chamoiseau's writing style has sometimes been compared to that of Louis-Ferdinand Celine, for how they explore the relationship between the written and the oral. Masculinity versus femininity  The dynamics and relationship between men and women have been a long-time subject of literature in the Caribbean.  The concept of \"masculinity\" versus \"femininity\" is a literary theme indicative of Caribbean literature.  Patrick Chamoiseau, like many other authors from the Caribbean, uses this theme in many of his literary works.  However, as there are a larger number of male writers that come out of the Caribbean, this topic of conversation is primarily male driven and takes the \"masculinist\" perspective. Chamoiseau has often been criticized as a somewhat patriarchal literary figure after having founded the masculinist Creolite movement in the Antilles archipelago.  The founding of this movement was intended to bring pride and nationalism to the male Antillean population that had been emasculated for centuries by being barred from holding positions of power and authority by their European colonizers.  The practice of slavery can be argued to have had a more detrimental effect on the male slave population than on the female slave population, as white slave owners attempting to have sexual affairs with female slaves would often offer them more privileges compared to their male counterparts. [citation needed] However, his literary work in the children's story \"Kosto et ses deux enfants\" (from Emerveilles) is in stark contrast to his typical patriarchal and masculine nature. The representation of men in Caribbean literature is typically portrayed in a negative light; in the story, this theme is contrasted by the main male character becoming an upstanding and respectable father figure. A question that many writers from the Caribbean try to answer is: \"What does it mean to be Caribbean?\" This question is the subject of a search for identity, and the word that Chamoiseau and his colleagues used to answer this question is \"Creoleness\".  Creoleness refers to how different cultures adapt and blend on islands or isolated areas, which in the case of the Caribbean, refers to the blending of African, Polynesian, and Asian cultures with that of their European colonizers.  This idea of Creoleness contrasts the idea of \"Americanness\" in that it existed prior to America, and that \"Americanness\" excludes it interaction with the indigenous population. [citation needed] This relates to Patrick Chamoiseau's writing style in that his choices are purposeful as his overall goal is to express this concept of Creoleness.  Creole Folktales is a prime example from his works.  The collection itself takes place around the 17th century in the French Antilles and Chamoiseau casts storyteller-narrator and uses creole in order to recreate the tradition of storytelling in the Antilles that was primarily oral.  Chamoiseau chooses these aspects to add to his writings as oral and historical accuracy are important in the representation of the Antilles and are crucial in bring awareness to Creoleness.

After studying law at universities in Martinique and Paris, he became a social worker.  Since returning to live in Fort-de-France, he has continued his vocation as a probation officer working with young offenders.  This proximity to Martinican society and culture has influenced his work.  Although he is principally known for his novels, Chamoiseau has ranged broadly into other genres.  He has written autobiographical narratives, assembled a collection of folktales, and been at the forefront of the theoretical debates surrounding creolite, or creoleness.  He has also written for the theater, contributed to discussions on contemporary Martinican and Caribbean politics, and collaborated on several photographic essays.  A testament to his importance and appeal as a writer and commentator is the portion of his work, both fiction and nonfiction, that has been translated into other languages.  Chamoiseau began to draw serious attention as a novelist after the publication of his first two novels, Chronique des sept miseres (Chronicle of the Seven Sorrows, 1986), and Solibo magnifique (Solibo Magnificent, 1988).  His third novel, and perhaps the most successful to date, is Texaco (1992), for which he garnered France's most important and prestigious literary award, the Prix Goncourt.  After the English translation of Texaco appeared in 1997, critical acclaim for his work began to take on new dimensions and his international stature as a writer grew.  Other awards include the 1993 Prix Carbet de la Caraibe for his novel Antan d'enfance (Childhood ), and in 2002 he was the recipient of the Prix Special du Jury RFO for his novel Biblique des derniers gestes (2002).  Chamoiseau's fictional trademark is his integration of French Creole into his French prose, thereby emphatically affirming the socio-cultural importance of the Creole language and its connection to an authentic Martinican identity.  It is this focus on language and orality that is also central to his theoretical work and the idea that it is not French, but rather Creole, that is the authentic linguistic representation of Martinique.  The subject and style of his fiction have closely mirrored the political and theoretical interventions of his essays.  His most important, and likely most controversial, was the 1989 Eloge de la creolite (In Praise of Creoleness ), a collaboration width writer Raphael Confiant and linguist Jean Bernabe, which signaled the official launch of the creolite movement.  In this seminal essay (in reality a manifesto), the authors argued that their identity was emphatically Creole; it was not singularly European, African, or Asian.  This was important because it was a direct challenge to the Negritude movement founded in part by the Martinican writer and politician Aime Cesaire.  The essay is, therefore, a move away from the black-white binary of Negritude, suggesting instead that politics, like literature, must reflect the complexities of multiracial histories and realities in places like Martinique and the wider Caribbean.  This theory, with all of its political and cultural implications for contemporary Martinique, continues to be fiercely debated.  Nevertheless, Chamoiseau continues to be one of the most important and creatively provocative voices in Caribbean and world literature.

The myth of Daphne and Apollo has an entrancing New World counterpart in Patrick Chamoiseaus \"Slave Old Man,\" the tale of a plantation fugitive who disappears into the \"forestine soul\" of colonial Martinique.  One fluid action sustains its plot: The old man runs.  Pursued by a vicious dog, he finds rejuvenation in natures wonders after a lifetime of mute obedience.  The world of slavery disintegrates in the elemental confrontations of the chase.  Imagine Walt Whitman adapting \"Apocalypto\" and you might approximate the awe and adrenaline of Chamoiseaus action pastoral.  The old man braves a nocturnal phantasmagoria of three-hooved horses, zombies with leafy heads, a demoness toting souls in an oxcart.  He battles a venomous serpent and a swarm of mangrove crabs, but also revels in the delicate beauty of a rare fern flower, the fresh taste of soil and the miracle of trees gathering their \"phantasmal contraband\" of light.  After nearly drowning in an ancient spring, he seamlessly assumes the novels narration, reborn in Adamic first person.  Before escaping, the old man is barely distinct from the sugar vats on a plantation where he goes by the name \"Old-Syrup. \" Neither his master nor his fellow slaves detect his dormant spirit, which erupts only after he locks eyes with the mastiff that will hunt him down.  His exhilarating flight evokes the shock of freedom with tactile immediacy.  \"The world was born without any veil of modesty,\" he marvels.  \"Buds and rotting spots, seeds and broken blossoms, earthly night solar light -- bound themselves together in one momentum. \" Image If the runaways of American literature seek autonomy and self-ownership, Chamoiseaus maroon enters a \"Great Woods\" where distinctions between past and present, human and animal, Old World and New dissolve.  Deep time makes a mockery of the plantations blinkered order; under the ancient canopy, the masters stride falters and the voices of African hunters and Amerindian priests resound from the depths of unrecorded millenniums.

So many lives, so many destinies, so many tracks go into the making of our unique path.  You dare say History, but I say histories, stories.  The one you take for the master stem of our manioc is but one stem among many others. . . . \" \"Some books shine through times, forever stirring spirits\" [Chamoiseau, 1992/7: 325].  Some books have such a distinct, authentic voice, which tells of the plight of ordinary people, that they cannot fail to move their readers, defying logical book analyses.  Martinique-born Patrick Chamoiseau wrote such precise book, with such a distinctive voice at the core of it, and it is called Texaco, published in French in 1992 (translated by Rose-Myriam Rejouis and Val Vinokurov in 1997).  This undoubtedly great book, which received the prestigious Prix Goncourt in 1992, reads almost like a fable, rather than a story, and evades strict categorisation.  What can be said for certain is that the novel is undeniably powerful in its transmission of the emotion and the message.  Told through the voice of the high-spirited, determined, but disadvantaged woman Marie-Sophie Laborieux, it presents a turbulent period in the history of Martinique, the French overseas territory, and focuses almost entirely on individual lives and life episodes.  At the centre of this story, which spans from 1823 to 1980, is, at first - Esternome, an ex-plantation slave, and, later, his daughter, our narrator, - Marie-Sophie, who are both determined to survive through extreme hardship and discrimination to fight for their loved ones and their peoples right to live and enjoy freedom on their native soil.  Sometimes the story reads like a highly subjective, almost chaotic, but matter-of-fact narrative, and at other times it takes a form of a strangely lyrical and poetic piece, which is even similar to a national ballad.  The story may even sometimes appear in the form of a cry or a lamentation, a strange ode to the Creole culture, language and tradition.  The impressive thing is that whatever mode the novel employs or impression it gives, it never loses its vitality, its importance, its power, its emotion.  This is the story of and by the generations who fought hard for their right to exist and prosper, and it is this unique perspective which makes this book so exceptional.  Texaco is really a tale of two cities - Saint Pierre and Fort-de-France, - and its inhabitants.  The story is divided into two parts and a number of sections that reflect a particular time period (none of them are too long): The Age of Straw (1823 - 1902); The Age of Crate Wood (1903 - 1945); The Age of Asbestos (1946 - 1960); and The Age of Concrete (1961 - 1980).  At the beginning of the book, the focus is the city of Saint Pierre, and we read how Esternome, Marie-Sophies father, is freed by his owner because of his act of bravery, even before other slaves on the plantation are given their freedom through the official proclamation of abolition.  At that point, Esternome finds himself in an uncertain place - no longer a slave, but still not having sufficient freedom and opportunities to earn a living.  The city becomes one of his options to survive in this world, and he starts to make a living through carpentry jobs, moving on to become a \"scientist\" of buildings, and later, building huts for others in the country.  Texaco is also a tale of obsessive love, and Esternomes love for a former slave girl Ninon is as moving and it is destructive.  \"That is life, meowed my Esternome (his daughter writes), thats all there is and nothing else, to live the showers of ones passion\" [Chamoiseau, 1992/7: 108].  The novel is great in contrasting the city-living with the country-dwelling.  The city is seen as belonging to bekes or white Creoles of Martinique, and only mulattos seem to know more or less how to survive in that strange environment.  \"The bekes had reduced this earth to a frightful circus whose laws they guarded\" [Chamoiseau, 1992/7: 50], writes Marie-Sophie.  With the impending abolition of slavery, there is also a rise of the confusing and complex race/class system.  \"My Esternome learned to label each person according to his degree of whiteness or unfortunate blackness\" [Chamoiseau, 1992/7: 70], says Marie-Sophie.  The interesting thing is that the story is set among great changes happening - the abolition of slavery proclamation followed by the increased industrialisation (the rise of factories); with the slaves liberation come different problems and people are forced to choose either starvation in the fields or hardship in the city.  We see the changes through the eyes of Esternome, a mans point of view, and then his daughter Marie-Sophie, a female viewpoint, giving us an interesting perspective on the drastic changes happening.  Thus, the second part of the book is about the city of Fort-de-France and the focus is Marie-Sophie herself.  When grown-up, she follows the path to the city to make the living like her father did before her.  We follow her part-time jobs in the city, and that is where she also finds her first \"love\".  It is also in the city where she \"embark[s] on the unknown world of books\".  Knowledge and literature do play a part in this story, and our heroine grows fond of books, which later enable her to understand the broader political implications of the situation of her people.  France is both far and near, and Sophie-Marie assumes the role of a fighter against the city to determine her peoples rights over the land.  Marie-Sophie almost single-handedly oversees the rise of Texaco, and becomes the centre of resistance in that village, a leader in the environment where \"there were a thousand wars to wage merely to exist\" [Chamoiseau, 1992/7: 320].  Much has been previously said about the obscure language sometimes used by Chamoiseau to tell the story - his free use of French mixed with Creole and some linguistic inventions.  It is for that precise reason some people criticised the novel.  However, it can be argued that the book is intentionally written in an unusual prose to give voice to Marie-Sophie, an uneducated daughter of ex-slave who went thorough hardships and vulgarities in her life, but without losing hope to achieve the best for herself and her people.  At the beginning of the novels first part, Marie-Sophie states: \"Say what you will, do what you will, life is not to be measured by the ell of its sorrows.  For that reason, I, Marie-Sophie Laborieux, despite the river my eyes have shed, have always looked at the world in a good light\" [Chamoiseau, 1992/7: 33].  The language reflects her style of expression, maybe influenced by pressures which once left her no choice but to be emphatic and loud in her demeanour/statements.  The narrative was also said to reflect African rhythms and melancholic Caribbean ballads.  Marie-Sophies sometimes imperfect sentences only make the story so much more authentic and powerful, with much emotion felt.  Some passages are, indeed, puzzling, but the linguistic freedom also reflects the freedom sought by people in the novel.  Each sentence is almost to be savoured as a special form of poetic beauty, and what some people may view as incomprehensible or difficult-to-read paragraphs, may actually point to authenticity, lyricism and an original way to tell an important story.  The narrator is the person who lived through it, and Texaco feels almost as real as any non-fiction.  There is a \"living life\" in the narrative, and Marie-Sophie herself considers the subject of writing her book.  In the story, she was advised to write \"simply\", but, instead, she wrote from her heart in the only language she knew.  The narrative may sometimes be unclear, but it is real and it is hers.  It is as though a heart or soul writes, making a special tribute to the Creole culture (culinary delights, hut-making techniques, etc), despairing about the fight for freedom, and questioning identities.  \"I wrote feelings which mingled verbs the way sleeper-women do.  I wrote colours like Rimbaud having visions.  I wrote melancholy which reinforced mine.  I wrote blinking howls which made my ink run by\"[Chamoiseau, 1992/7: 360], says Marie-Sophie.  The narrative has many melancholy notes, but it is also full of hope.  \"With necklaces and jewels, ribbons and hats, [the people] were erecting in their soul the little chapels which would at the right time stir up the fervour of their short-lived rebellions\" [Chamoiseau, 1992/7: 81], and \"carrying freedom is the only load that straightens the back\" [Chamoiseau, 1992/7: 101], writes Marie-Sophie.  Texaco is a classic novel written in a distinctive prose.  It is about people trying to survive and accustom themselves to the growing societal changes, while also trying to combat unfair regimes imposed on them.  It is an original family saga, which carries an important message and voice, which, even if fictional, is still needed to be heard.  Inspirational and moving, and having as much political and cultural observations as poetical wisdom and historical insight, the book becomes all about finding that one small rebellious voice, that with patience and commitment has the potential to grow to become the voice of the generation.

She taught many of the leading composers and musicians of the 20th century, and also performed occasionally as a pianist and organist. From a musical family, she achieved early honours as a student at the Conservatoire de Paris but, believing that she had no particular talent as a composer, she gave up writing music and became a teacher.  In that capacity, she influenced generations of young composers, especially those from the United States and other English-speaking countries.  Among her students were many important composers, soloists, arrangers, and conductors, including Grazyna Bacewicz, Burt Bacharach, Daniel Barenboim, Lennox Berkeley, Idil Biret, Elliott Carter, Aaron Copland, John Eliot Gardiner, Philip Glass, Roy Harris, Quincy Jones, Dinu Lipatti, Igor Markevitch, Astor Piazzolla, Virgil Thomson, and George Walker. Boulanger taught in the US and England, working with music academies including the Juilliard School, the Yehudi Menuhin School, the Longy School, the Royal College of Music and the Royal Academy of Music, but her principal base for most of her life was her family's flat in Paris, where she taught for most of the seven decades from the start of her career until her death at the age of 92.  Boulanger was the first woman to conduct many major orchestras in America and Europe, including the BBC Symphony, Boston Symphony, Halle, and Philadelphia orchestras.  She conducted several world premieres, including works by Copland and Stravinsky. Early life and education  Nadia Boulanger was born in Paris on 16 September 1887, to French composer and pianist Ernest Boulanger (1815-1900) and his wife Raissa Myshetskaya (1856-1935), a Russian princess, who descended from St.  Mikhail Tchernigovsky. Ernest Boulanger had studied at the Paris Conservatoire and, in 1835 at the age of 20, won the coveted Prix de Rome for composition.  He wrote comic operas and incidental music for plays, but was most widely known for his choral music.  He achieved distinction as a director of choral groups, teacher of voice, and a member of choral competition juries.  After years of rejection, in 1872 he was appointed to the Paris Conservatoire as professor of singing.  Raissa qualified as a home tutor (or governess) in 1873.  According to Ernest, he and Raissa met in Russia in 1873, and she followed him back to Paris.  She joined his voice class at the Conservatoire in 1876, and they were married in Russia in 1877.  Ernest and Raissa had a daughter, Ernestine Mina Juliette, who died as an infant before Nadia was born on her father's 72nd birthday.  Through her early years, although both parents were very active musically, Nadia would get upset by hearing music and hide until it stopped.  In 1892, when Nadia was five, Raissa became pregnant again.  During the pregnancy, Nadia's response to music changed drastically.  \"One day I heard a fire bell.  Instead of crying out and hiding, I rushed to the piano and tried to reproduce the sounds.  My parents were amazed. \" After this, Boulanger paid great attention to the singing lessons her father gave, and began to study the rudiments of music.  Her sister, named Marie-Juliette Olga but known as Lili Boulanger, was born in 1893, when Nadia was six.  When Ernest brought Nadia home from their friends' house, before she was allowed to see her mother or Lili, he made her promise solemnly to be responsible for the new baby's welfare.  He urged her to take part in her sister's care.  From the age of seven, Nadia studied in preparation for her Conservatoire entrance exams, sitting in on their classes and having private lessons with its teachers.  Lili often stayed in the room for these lessons, sitting quietly and listening.  In 1896, the nine-year-old Nadia entered the Conservatoire.  She studied there with Faure and others.  She came in third in the 1897 solfege competition, and subsequently worked to win first prize in 1898.  She took private lessons from Louis Vierne and Alexandre Guilmant.  During this period, she also received religious instruction to become an observant Catholic, taking her First Communion on 4 May 1899.  The Catholic religion remained important to her for the rest of her life.  In 1900 her father Ernest died, and money became a problem for the family.  Raissa had an extravagant lifestyle, and the royalties she received from performances of Ernest's music were insufficient to live on permanently.  Nadia continued to work hard at the Conservatoire to become a teacher and be able to contribute to her family's support.  In 1903, Nadia won the Conservatoire's first prize in harmony; she continued to study for years, although she had begun to earn money through organ and piano performances.  She studied composition with Gabriel Faure and, in the 1904 competitions, she came first in three categories: organ, accompagnement au piano and fugue (composition).  At her accompagnement exam, Boulanger met Raoul Pugno, a renowned French pianist, organist and composer, who subsequently took an interest in her career.  In the autumn of 1904, Nadia began to teach from the family apartment, at 36 rue Ballu. In addition to the private lessons she held there, Boulanger started holding a Wednesday afternoon group class in analysis and sightsinging.  She continued these almost to her death.  This class was followed by her famous \"at homes\", salons at which students could mingle with professional musicians and Boulanger's other friends from the arts, such as Igor Stravinsky, Paul Valery, Faure, and others. After leaving the Conservatoire in 1904 and before her sister's untimely death in 1918, Boulanger was a keen composer, encouraged by both Pugno and Faure.  Caroline Potter, writing in The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, says of Boulanger's music: \"Her musical language is often highly chromatic (though always tonally based), and Debussy's influence is apparent. \" Her goal was to win the First Grand Prix de Rome as her father had done, and she worked tirelessly towards it in addition to her increasing teaching and performing commitments.  She first submitted work for judging in 1906, but failed to make it past the first round.  In 1907 she progressed to the final round but again did not win.  In late 1907 she was appointed to teach elementary piano and accompagnement au piano at the newly created Conservatoire Femina-Musica.  She was also appointed as assistant to Henri Dallier, the professor of harmony at the Conservatoire.  In the 1908 Prix de Rome competition, Boulanger caused a stir by submitting an instrumental fugue rather than the required vocal fugue.  The subject was taken up by the national and international newspapers, and was resolved only when the French Minister of Public Information decreed that Boulanger's work be judged on its musical merit alone.  She won the Second Grand Prix for her cantata, La Sirene.  In 1908, as well as performing piano duets in public concerts, Boulanger and Pugno collaborated on composing a song cycle, Les Heures claires, which was well-received enough to encourage them to continue working together.  Still hoping for a Grand Prix de Rome, Boulanger entered the 1909 competition but failed to win a place in the final round.  Later that year, her sister Lili, then sixteen, announced to the family her intention to become a composer and win the Prix de Rome herself.  In 1910, Annette Dieudonne became a student of Boulanger's, continuing with her for the next fourteen years.  When her studies ended, she began teaching Boulanger's students the rudiments of music and solfege.  She was Boulanger's close friend and assistant for the rest of her life.  Boulanger attended the premiere of Diaghilev's ballet The Firebird in Paris, with music by Stravinsky.  She immediately recognised the young composer's genius and began a lifelong friendship with him.  In April 1912, Nadia Boulanger made her debut as a conductor, leading the Societe des Matinees Musicales orchestra.  They performed her 1908 cantata La Sirene, two of her songs, and Pugno's Concertstuck for piano and orchestra.  The composer played as soloist.  Lili Boulanger won the Prix de Rome in 1913, the first woman to do so. With the advent of war in Europe in 1914, public programs were reduced, and Boulanger had to put her performing and conducting on hold.  She continued to teach privately and to assist Dallier at the Conservatoire.  Nadia was drawn into Lili's expanding war work, and by the end of the year, the sisters had organised a sizable charity, the Comite Franco-Americain du Conservatoire National de Musique et de Declamation.  It supplied items such as food, clothing, money, and letters from home to soldiers who had been musicians before the war.  Weakened by her work during the war, Lili began to suffer ill health.  She died in March 1918. Nadia struggled with the death of her sister and according to Jeanice Brooks, \"[t]he dichotomy between private grief and public strength was strongly characteristic of Boulanger's frame of mind in the immediate aftermath of World War I.  Guilt at surviving her talented sibling seems to have led to determination to deserve Lili's death, which Nadia framed as redemptive sacrifice, by throwing herself into work and domestic responsibility: as Nadia wrote in her datebook in January 1919, 'I place this new year before you, my little beloved Lili-may it see me fulfill my duty towards you-so that it is less terrible for Mother and that I try to resemble you. '\" In 1919, Boulanger performed in more than twenty concerts, often programming her own music and that of her sister. Since the Conservatoire Femina-Musica had closed during the war, Alfred Cortot and Auguste Mangeot founded a new music school in Paris, which opened later that year as the Ecole normale de musique de Paris.  Boulanger was invited by Cortot to join the school, where she taught classes in harmony, counterpoint, musical analysis, organ and composition.  Mangeot also asked Boulanger to contribute articles of music criticism to his paper Le Monde Musical, and she occasionally provided articles for this and other newspapers for the rest of her life, though she never felt at ease setting her opinions down for posterity in this way. In 1920, Boulanger began to compose again, writing a series of songs to words by Camille Mauclair.  In 1921, she performed at two concerts in support of women's rights, both of which featured music by Lili. However later in life she claimed never to have been involved with feminism, and that women should not have the right to vote as they \"lacked the necessary political sophistication. \" American School at Fontainebleau, 1921-1935  Chateau de Fontainebleau In the summer of 1921 the French Music School for Americans opened in Fontainebleau, with Boulanger listed on the programme as a professor of harmony. Her close friend Isidor Philipp headed the piano departments of both the Paris Conservatory and the new Fontainebleau School and was an important draw for American students.  She inaugurated the custom, which would continue for the rest of her life, of inviting the best students to her summer residence at Gargenville one weekend for lunch and dinner.  Among the students attending the first year at Fontainebleau was Aaron Copland. Boulanger's unrelenting schedule of teaching, performing, composing, and writing letters started to take its toll on her health; she had frequent migraines and toothaches.  She stopped writing as a critic for Le Monde musical as she could not attend the requisite concerts.  To maintain her and her mother's living standards, she concentrated on teaching which was her most lucrative source of income. Faure believed she was mistaken to stop composing, but she told him, \"If there is one thing of which I am certain, it is that I wrote useless music. \" In 1924, Walter Damrosch, Arthur Judson and the New York Symphony Society arranged for Boulanger to tour the USA.  She set sail on the Cunard flagship RMS Aquitania on Christmas Eve.  The ship arrived on New Year's Eve in New York after an extremely rough crossing. During this tour, she performed solo organ works, pieces by Lili, and premiered Copland's new Symphony for Organ and Orchestra, which he had written for her.  She returned to France on 28 February 1925. Later that year, Boulanger approached the publisher Schirmer to enquire if they would be interested in publishing her methods of teaching music to children.  When nothing came of it, she abandoned trying to write about her ideas. Gershwin visited Boulanger in 1927, asking for lessons in composition.  They spoke for half an hour after which Boulanger announced, \"I can teach you nothing. \" Taking this as a compliment, Gershwin repeated the story many times. The Great Depression increased social tensions in France.  Days after the Stavisky riots in February 1934, and in the midst of a general strike, Boulanger resumed conducting.  She made her Paris debut with the orchestra of the Ecole normale in a programme of Mozart, Bach, and Jean Francaix. Boulanger's private classes continued; Elliott Carter recalled that students who did not dare to cross Paris through the riots showed only that they did not \"take music seriously enough\". By the end of the year, she was conducting the Orchestre Philharmonique de Paris in the Theatre des Champs-Elysees with a programme of Bach, Monteverdi and Schutz. Her mother Raissa died in March 1935, after a long decline.  This freed Boulanger from some of her ties to Paris, which had prevented her from taking up teaching opportunities in the United States. In 1936, Boulanger substituted for Alfred Cortot in some of his piano masterclasses, coaching the students in Mozart's keyboard works. Later in the year, she traveled to London to broadcast her lecture-recitals for the BBC, as well as to conduct works including Schutz, Faure and Lennox Berkeley.  Noted as the first woman to conduct the London Philharmonic Orchestra, she received acclaim for her performances. Boulanger's long-held passion for Monteverdi culminated in her recording six discs of madrigals for HMV in 1937, which brought his music to a new, wider audience. Not all reviewers approved her use of modern instruments. When Hindemith published his The Craft of Musical Composition, Boulanger asked him for permission to translate the text into French, and to add her own comments.  Hindemith never responded to her offer.  After he fled from Nazi Germany to the United States, they did not discuss the matter further. Late in 1937, Boulanger returned to Britain to broadcast for the BBC and hold her popular lecture-recitals.  In November, she became the first woman to conduct a complete concert of the Royal Philharmonic Society in London, which included Faure's Requiem and Monteverdi's Amor (Lamento della ninfa). Describing her concerts, Mangeot wrote, She never uses a dynamic level louder than mezzo-forte and she takes pleasure in veiled, murmuring sonorities, from which she nevertheless obtains great power of expression.  She arranges her dynamic levels so as never to have need of fortissimo . . . In 1938, Boulanger returned to the US for a longer tour.  She had arranged to give a series of lectures at Radcliffe, Harvard, Wellesley and the Longy School of Music, and to broadcast for NBC.  During this tour, she became the first woman to conduct the Boston Symphony Orchestra.  In her three months there, she gave over a hundred lecture-recitals, recitals and concerts These included the world premiere of Stravinsky's Dumbarton Oaks Concerto.  At that time she was seen by American sculptor Katharine Lane Weems who recorded in her diary, \"Her voice is surprisingly deep.  She is quite slim with an excellent figure and fine features, Her skin is delicate, her hair graying slightly, she wears pince-nez and gesticulates as she becomes excited talking about music. \" HMV issued two additional Boulanger records in 1938: the Piano Concerto in D by Jean Francaix, which she conducted; and the Brahms Liebeslieder Waltzes, in which she and Dinu Lipatti were the duo pianists with a vocal ensemble, and (again with Lipatti) a selection of the Brahms Waltzes, Op.  39 for piano four hands. During Boulanger's tour of America the following year, she became the first woman to conduct the New York Philharmonic Orchestra at Carnegie Hall, the Philadelphia Orchestra and the Washington National Symphony Orchestra.  She gave 102 lectures in 118 days across the US. Second World War and emigration, 1940-45  As the Second World War loomed, Boulanger helped her students leave France.  She made plans to do so herself.  Stravinsky joined her at Gargenville, where they awaited news of the German attack against France. Waiting to leave France till the last moment before the invasion and occupation, Boulanger arrived in New York via Madrid and Lisbon on 6 November 1940. After her arrival, Boulanger traveled to the Longy School of Music in Cambridge to give classes in harmony, fugue, counterpoint and advanced composition. In 1942, she also began teaching at the Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore.  Her classes included music history, harmony, counterpoint, fugue, orchestration and composition. Leaving America at the end of 1945, she returned to France in January 1946.  There she accepted a position of professor of accompagnement au piano at the Paris Conservatoire. In 1953, she was appointed overall director of the Fontainebleau School. She also continued her touring to other countries.  As a long-standing friend of the family, and as official chapel-master to the Prince of Monaco, Boulanger was asked to organise the music for the wedding of Prince Rainier of Monaco and the American actress Grace Kelly in 1956. In 1958, she returned to the US for a six-week tour.  She combined broadcasting, lecturing, and making four television films. Also in 1958, she was inducted as an Honorary Member into Sigma Alpha Iota, the international women's music fraternity, by the Gamma Delta chapter at the Crane School of Music in Potsdam, New York. In 1962, she toured Turkey, where she conducted concerts with her young protegee Idil Biret. Later that year, she was invited to the White House of the United States by President John F.  Kennedy and his wife Jacqueline, and in 1966, she was invited to Moscow to jury for the International Tchaikovsky Competition, chaired by Emil Gilels. While in England, she taught at the Yehudi Menuhin School.  She also gave lectures at the Royal College of Music and the Royal Academy of Music, all of which were broadcast by the BBC. Her eyesight and hearing began to fade toward the end of her life.  On 13 August 1977, in advance of her 90th birthday, she was given a surprise birthday celebration at Fontainebleau's English Garden.  The school's chef had prepared a large cake, on which was inscribed: \"1887-Happy Birthday to you, Nadia Boulanger-Fontainebleau, 1977\".  When the cake was served, 90 small white candles floating on the pond illuminated the area.  Boulanger's then-protege, Emile Naoumoff, performed a piece he had composed for the occasion. Boulanger worked almost until her death in 1979 in Paris.  She is buried at the Montmartre Cemetery with her sister Lili and their parents. 36 rue Ballu, Paris Asked about the difference between a well-made work and a masterpiece, Boulanger replied, I can tell whether a piece is well-made or not, and I believe that there are conditions without which masterpieces cannot be achieved, but I also believe that what defines a masterpiece cannot be pinned down.  I won't say that the criterion for a masterpiece does not exist, but I don't know what it is. She claimed to enjoy all \"good music\".  According to Lennox Berkeley, \"A good waltz has just as much value to her as a good fugue, and this is because she judges a work solely on its aesthetic content. \" \"She was an admirer of Debussy, and a disciple of Ravel.  Although she bore little sympathy for Schoenberg and the Viennese dodecaphonicians, she was an ardent champion of Stravinsky. \" She insisted on complete attention at all times: \"Anyone who acts without paying attention to what he is doing is wasting his life.  I'd go so far as to say that life is denied by lack of attention, whether it be to cleaning windows or trying to write a masterpiece. \" In 1920, two of her favourite female students left her to marry.  She thought they had betrayed their work with her and their obligation to music.  Her attitude to women in music was contradictory: despite Lili's success and her own eminence as a teacher, she held throughout her life that a woman's duty was to be a wife and mother. According to Ned Rorem, she would \"always give the benefit of the doubt to her male students while overtaxing the females\". She saw teaching as a pleasure, a privilege and a duty: \"No-one is obliged to give lessons.  It poisons your life if you give lessons and it bores you. \" Boulanger accepted pupils from any background; her only criterion was that they had to want to learn.  She treated students differently depending on their ability: her talented students were expected to answer the most rigorous questions and perform well under stress.  The less able students, who did not intend to follow a career in music, were treated more leniently, and Michel Legrand claimed that the ones she disliked were graduated with a first prize in one year: \"The good pupils never got a reward so they stayed.  I was [there] for seven years.  And I never obtained a first prize\". Each student had to be approached differently: \"When you accept a new pupil, the first thing is to try to understand what natural gift, what intuitive talent he has.  Each individual poses a particular problem. \" \"It does not matter what style you use, as long as you use it consistently. \" Boulanger used a variety of teaching methods, including traditional harmony, score reading at the piano, species counterpoint, analysis, and sight-singing (using fixed-Do solfege). When she first looked at a student's score, she often commented on its relation to the work of a variety of composers: for example, \"[T]hese measures have the same harmonic progressions as Bach's F major prelude and Chopin's F major Ballade.  Can you not come up with something more interesting?\" Virgil Thomson found this process frustrating: \"Anyone who allowed her in any piece to tell him what to do next would see that piece ruined before his eyes by the application of routine recipes and bromides from standard repertory. \" Copland recalled that \"she had but one all-embracing principle . . .  the creation of what she called la grande ligne - the long line in music. \" She disapproved of innovation for innovation's sake: \"When you are writing music of your own, never strain to avoid the obvious. \" She said, \"You need an established language and then, within that established language, the liberty to be yourself.  It's always necessary to be yourself - that is a mark of genius in itself. \" Quincy Jones says Boulanger told him \"Your music can never be more or less than you are as a human being\". She always claimed that she could not bestow creativity onto her students and that she could only help them to become intelligent musicians who understood the craft of composition.  \"I can't provide anyone with inventiveness, nor can I take it away; I can simply provide the liberty to read, to listen, to see, to understand. \" Only inspiration could make the difference between a well-made piece and an artistic one. She believed that the desire to learn, to become better, was all that was required to achieve - always provided the right amount of work was put in.  She would quote the examples of Rameau (who wrote his first opera at fifty), Wojtowicz (who became a concert pianist at thirty-one), and Roussel (who had no professional access to music till he was twenty-five), as counter-arguments to the idea that great artists always develop out of gifted children. Her memory was prodigious: by the time she was twelve, she knew the whole of Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier by heart. Students have described her as knowing every significant piece, by every significant composer. Copland recalls, Nadia Boulanger knew everything there was to know about music; she knew the oldest and the latest music, pre-Bach and post-Stravinsky.  All technical know-how was at her fingertips: harmonic transposition, the figured bass, score reading, organ registration, instrumental techniques, structural analyses, the school fugue and the free fugue, the Greek modes and Gregorian chant. Murray Perahia recalled being \"awed by the rhythm and character\" with which she played a line of a Bach fugue. Janet Craxton recalled listening to Boulanger's playing Bach chorales on the piano as \"the single greatest musical experience of my life\". Vocal Allons voir sur le lac d'argent (A.

A residency at the villa was typically awarded to the winner of the Prix de Rome, a major competition for French composers; Lili had won in 1913, but an earlier visit to Italy had been interrupted by the outbreak of World War I.  When the sisters arrived, the villa was mostly empty because of the war, and they quickly got to work.  Each was trying to finish an opera, and they found solace and inspiration in each others creativity.  It was a perhaps unprecedented moment in classical musics patriarchal history: two women, side by side, composing operas.  \"They really did lean on one another,\" the musicologist Kimberly Francis, who has written a forthcoming journal article about the sisterly collaborators, said in a recent interview.  \"It was this unique partnership. \"", "article_2": "The French composer, conductor, organist and influential teacher, Nadia (Juliette) Boulanger, was born to a musical family.  Her grandmother, Marie-Julie Boulanger, was a celebrated singer at the Opera Comique.  Her grandfather, Frederic Boulanger won first prize for the cello in his fifth year (1797) at the recently founded Paris Conservatoire.  Her father, Ernest Boulanger (1815-1900), entered the Conservatoire at the age of 16, studying piano, violin, and composition.  In 1835, he won the Conservatoire's top prize, the Prix de Rome, for a one-act opera, Le Diable a l'Ecole (The Devil at School).  He later taught singing at the Conservatoire.  In 1874, while he was performing in Russia, he met a young, married Russian schoolteacher, Raissa Suvalov (nee Myschetsky).  She moved to Paris to attend his singing class at the Conservatoire, and in 1877 they married; she was aged 20 and he 62.  Their first child, Juliette Nadia Boulanger was born in Paris ten years later.  By her sixth birthday, she was studying music under her mother's tutelage.  A second child, Lili, was born in 1893.  The ageing father asked Nadia to promise to look after the newborn girl for the rest of her life.  Nadia Boulanger entered the Conservatoire at the age of 10, studying harmony with Paul Vidal and composition with Charles Marie Widor and Gabriel Faure; she also studied the organ privately with Louis Vierne and Felix-Alexandre Guilmant.  While still a student at the Conservatoire, she became the family's only breadwinner on the death of her father in 1900.  She began taking engagements as a pianist, and teaching private students in the family's new flat in the rue Ballu, where she continued to live and teach until her death more than 75 years later.  Among her early pupils was her younger sister, Lili, who studied counterpoint with her.  In 1906, Boulanger became Gabriel Faure's assistant at the great organ of the Eglise de la Madeleine.  She remained a lifelong devotee of his music and later introduced his Requiem to several cities in Britain and the USA.  After winning the Conservatoire's top prizes for harmony, counterpoint, fugue, organ and piano accompaniment, Nadia Boulanger came to wider public attention in 1908, when, in a preliminary round for the Prix de Rome, she submitted a fugue for string quartet, rather than for voices as specified, causing a stir in musical circles.  Despite objections from at least one examiner, she was allowed to progress to the final round, and was placed second with her cantata La sirene.  She failed to win the Premier Grand Prix the following year also, even though on both occasions she was generally acknowledged to have written the best cantata.  Her younger sister Lili, who was, as Boulanger acknowledged, the more talented composer, won the Premier Grand Prix de Rome in 1913, the first woman composer to do so.  By that time, Nadia was firmly established as a teacher, and had little time to compose.  Nadia Boulanger's compositions, published between 1901 and 1922, comprise 29 songs for solo singer and piano; nine larger-scale vocal works, some with orchestra; five works for instrumental solo (organ, cello, piano); two orchestral works, and an opera, La ville morte, and a song cycle, Les heures claires, both composed jointly with Raoul Pugno, for whom she composed a Fantaisie variee for piano and orchestra.  The opera was due to be staged in 1914, but owing to Pugno's death and events leading up to World War I, it was never performed.  A complete vocal score and the orchestration of Acts 1 and 3 survive.  The Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians says of Boulanger's music, \"Her musical language is often highly chromatic (though always tonally based), and Debussy's influence is apparent . . .  her self-critical attitude (the Fantaisie variee bears signs of extensive revision and is not performable in its present state) led her to concentrate on teaching. \" Most of her compositions date from before her younger sister's triumph at the Prix de Rome.  Lili had never been healthy, and in 1918 she died.  After Lili's death, Nadia abandoned composition, publishing only a few songs in 1922, and then nothing more.  Faure believed she was mistaken to stop composing, but she told told him, \"If there is one thing of which I am certain, it is that my music is worthless. \" Nadia Boulanger, who liked to be known as \"Mademoiselle\", made her conducting debut in 1912.  She was the first woman to conduct several major symphony orchestras, including the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the Philadelphia Orchestra, and in England the Halle Orchestra of Manchester and the BBC Symphony Orchestra.  On her first American tour she premiered Aaron Copland's Symphony for Organ and Orchestra.  1937 she became the first woman to conduct a complete concert of the Royal Philharmonic Society in London.  In 1938 she directed the first performance of Igor Stravinskys Concerto, Dumbarton Oaks in Washington DC.  As a performer she made few recordings.  In 1937 HMV issued three sets of discs featuring her: the Piano Concerto in D by Jean Francaix, which she conducted; the Johannes Brahms Liebeslieder Waltzes, in which she and Dinu Lipatti were the duo pianists with a vocal ensemble; and the first recordings of any music by Monteverdi: a selection of his madrigals, which she directed.  The composer Ned Rorem described Nadia Boulanger as \"the most influential teacher since Socrates. \" She taught a very large number of students from Europe, Australia, and Canada, as well as over 600 American musicians.  However, neither she nor Annette Dieudonne, her life-long friend and assistant, kept records of the students who studied with her.  It is, moreover, virtually impossible to determine the nature and extent of many musicians' private study with Boulanger, ranging from prolonged and intensive tuition to brief, informal advice.  Nadia Boulanger's first teaching position was at the Conservatoire Femina-Musica in Paris in 1907.  Later, she was one of the first staff members at Alfred Cortot's Ecole Normale de Musique de Paris, beginning in 1920, where she taught a large variety of subjects.  She was disappointed at not winning an appointment to the faculty of the Conservatoire, but in 1921 she was invited to join the first faculty of the Conservatoire Americain at Fontainebleau.  This was a summer school, sponsored by American donors, at which Boulanger taught harmony, counterpoint, and composition under the directorship of Paul Dukas.  Among her first pupils there was Aaron Copland, who was followed by many other young American composers.  Some of her students from the 1920s on, including Copland, Quincy Jones, Denoe Leedy, Walter Piston, George Peter Tingley, Roy Harris, Virgil Thomson, Michel Legrand, Joe Raposo, Philip Glass, Robert Shafer, and Elliott Carter established a new school of composition based on her teaching.  Virgil Thompson once said that every town in the USA had a five-and-dime and a Boulanger pupil.  Boulanger eventually became director of the Conservatoire Americain in 1948.  She also taught at the Longy School of Music and the Paris Conservatoire.  She lived in the USA during World War II and taught at Wellesley College, Radcliffe College, and the Juilliard School.  Nadia Boulanger's European students included Igor Markevitch, John Eliot Gardiner, Jean Francaix, Francis Chagrin, and Lennox Berkeley.  In England she taught at the Yehudi Menuhin School, and gave lectures on a wide range of music topics at the Royal Collegof Music and the Royal Academy of Music which were broadcast nationally by the BBC.  She also served on the juries of international piano competitions including, in 1966, the International Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow, chaired by Emil Gilels.  Nadi Boulanger's teaching methods included traditional harmony, score reading at the piano, species counterpoint, analysis, and sight singing (using fixed-Do solfege).  She disapproved of innovation for innovation's sake: \"When you are writing music of your own, never strain to avoid the obvious. \" \"You need an established language and then, within that established language, the liberty to be yourself.  It's always necessary to be yourself - that is a mark of genius in itself. \" Even though her eyesight and hearing began to fade towards the end of her life, Nadia Boulanger worked almost until her death in 1979.

Although her teaching base was in the family apartment at 36 Rue Ballu in the ninth arrondisement of Paris, she also taught in the US and UK, working with leading conservatoires including the Juilliard School, the Yehudi Menuhin School, the Royal College of Music and the Royal Academy of Music.  With such a contribution, she might also arguably be described as the most important woman in the history of classical music.  Not that shed appreciate attention being drawn to her gender.  Being female was, for Boulanger, no apparent barrier to achievement.  In addition to her remarkable teaching career, she became the first woman to conduct many of the major US and European symphony orchestras, including the BBC Symphony, Boston Symphony, Halle Orchestra and New York Philharmonic.  Boulanger was also a mentor to Igor Stravinsky and an ardent champion of his music when much of the musical world remained unconvinced of its genius.  She was responsible for bringing to life a number of ground-breaking world premieres.  Hidden figure? But be honest: have you ever heard of her? Boulangers name remains largely unknown outside niche classical music circles, despite the astonishing impact she had on the soundtrack to all our lives, not just in the realm of classical but in jazz, tango, funk and hip-hop.  It is frankly unimaginable that a man with a similar degree of influence over 20th Century music would have been so ignored. ", "article_5": "Nadia Boulanger, (born Sept.  16, 1887, Paris, France--died Oct.  22, 1979, Paris), conductor, organist, and one of the most influential teachers of musical composition of the 20th century.  Boulangers family had been associated for two generations with the Paris Conservatory, where her father and first instructor, Ernest Boulanger, was a teacher of voice.  She received her formal training there in 1897-1904, studying composition with Gabriel Faure and organ with Charles-Marie Widor.  She later taught composition at the conservatory and privately.  She also published a few short works and in 1908 won second place in the Prix de Rome competition with her cantata La Sirene.  She ceased composing, rating her works \"useless,\" after the death in 1918 of her talented sister Lili Boulanger, also a composer.  In 1921 Boulanger began her long association with the American Conservatory, founded after World War I at Fontainebleau by the conductor Walter Damrosch for American musicians.  She was organist for the premiere (1925) of the Symphony for Organ and Orchestra by Aaron Copland, her first American pupil, and appeared as the first woman conductor of the Boston, New York Philharmonic, and Philadelphia orchestras in 1938.  She had already become (1937) the first woman to conduct an entire program of the Royal Philharmonic in London.  In the late 1930s Boulanger recorded little-known works of Claudio Monteverdi, championed rarely performed works by Heinrich Schutz and Faure, and promoted early French music.  She spent the period of World War II in the United States, mainly as a teacher at the Washington (D. C. ) College of Music and the Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore, Md.  Returning to France, she taught again at the Paris and American conservatories, becoming director of the latter in 1949.  In addition to Copland, Boulangers pupils included the composers Lennox Berkeley, Easley Blackwood, Marc Blitzstein, Elliott Carter, Jean Francaix, Roy Harris, Walter Piston, and Virgil Thomson.  Her influence as a teacher was always personal rather than pedantic: she refused to write a textbook of theory.  Her aim was to enlarge the students aesthetic comprehensions while developing individual gifts.

Her fathers parents were the cellist and Paris Conservatoire teacher, Frederic Boulanger, and mezzo-soprano, Marie-Julie Halligner.  A conductor and composer, Nadia studied music at the Paris Conservatoire between 1897 and 1904, taking composition lessons with Gabriel Faure and learning the organ with Charles-Marie Widor.

To Nadia, her own works were now \"useless\".  She dedicated herself to a lifetime of teaching, and would become one of the greatest music pedagogues in recent music history.

Born in Barcelona, he studied there at the Llotja School.  His early work had the clear academic imprint of his teacher, Modest Urgell.  In 1894 he moved to Paris, and studied at the Academie Julian.  He adopted a more personal style, after that of Degas and Toulouse-Lautrec, with their depictions of nocturnal and interior subjects.  But his work was also marked by the intense colors which presaged the arrival of Fauvism.  Lively brushwork reveals strong Oriental and Arab influences.  Allied with the Vienna Secession movement, his decorative style draws comparison to Gustav Klimt. One of his most important works is a portrait of Sonia Klamery.

After training in Barcelona, he moved to Paris in 1894 where he attended the Academie Julian.  During this period in his life he painted numerous pictures of Paris night-life, concentrating on pallet and light effects.  Angladas painting was visibly influenced by artists such as Toulouse Lautrec, Gustav Klimt and Kees van Dongen.  A very significant turning point in his style came in 1909, with the arrival in Paris of impresario Sergei Diaghilevs Ballets Russes, featuring Vaslav Nijinski and Anna Pavlova.  The Ballet Russes was a social and artistic sensation that revolutionised both tastes and customs.  Anglada Camarasa was deeply moved by the sets and costumes of vibrant oranges, purples and greens, to the extent that from then on the pale shades in his female portraits were replaced by brilliant multicolours.  The impact in Paris of the aesthetics of Diaghilevs production was decisive for the development of his work.  Following a trip to Valencia in the summer of 1904, his work centred more on Spanish traditional culture, with its marked decorativism, and he incorporated elements from the hispanic decorativism in his Parisian work.  He grew more successful throughout Europe and his work found a particularly favourable public in Italy and amongst the artists of the Russian modern school, including among his admirers Maksim Gorka and Vasili Kandinsky.  He participated in numerous international exhibitions: Munich, Venice (Biennales VI, VII and XI), Paris (Salon National, Salon d'Automne and Salon des Orientalistes), Barcelona, Berlin, Brussels, London, Zurich, Buenos Aires (Grand Prix, 1910), Rome (Grand Prix , 1911), Prague and Moscow.  His influence also reached young artists like Pablo Picasso, ten years younger than him and with whom he was in contact during his stay in Montmartre, or Maria Blanchard, who was his student between 1908 and 1913. ", "article_2": "Hermen Anglada-Camarasa was one of the most influential and radical artists of his day, gaining fame internationally at the turn of the 20th century for his expressionistic paintings of folkloric subjects.  His brilliant palette influenced artists such as Pablo Picasso and Wassily Kandinksy, who saw the Spaniard's work when he was studying at the Academie Julian in Paris.  His landscapes bear comparison with those of contemporaries such as Gustav Klimt -- with whom he shared a Gold Medal at the 1911 International Exhibition in Rome -- and in his understanding of colour, of the decorative and of form, he was in the vanguard of artists such and Pierre Bonnard, Henri Matisse and Edouard Vuillard, with whom he shared the international limelight.  As S.  Hutchinson Harris wrote in the seminal English study of the artist: \"Anglada uses colour as Wagner used instruments, in a manner which appeared extravagant in his day, but which gave a new impetus to music. \" (S.  Hutchinson-Harris, The Art of H.  Anglada-Camarasa: A Study in Modern Art, 2 vols, London, 1929, p.  14).  The present work belongs to a seminal group of paintings, which fall naturally under the title of \"Valencia\".  \"In Valencia he [Anglada] was just in time to see in the fiestas of the conservative peasantry, though fast disappearing, the last natural survival of the gorgeous pageantry of the medieval past.  For them were brought out the carefully preserved rich floral dresses, and the gay caparisons of the horses; for them the women were no less gaily decked, in their cofia and jewels.  All these Anglada wove into decorative pictures.  His immediate predecessors had been largely engaged in the representational painting of historical scenes which today appear to us lifeless, and leave us cold.  So far modern as to forego illustration, painting the beautiful things he saw before him, by the skilful weaving of colour and line he manages to evoke in us the lively sense of joie de vivre by which he was himself animated at the picture's birth. \" (S.  Hutchinson-Harris, op.  cit. , p.  12).  Anglada first exhibited his Valencia theme paintings at the Salon National de Paris in 1906.  They resulted from a trip he made to the Valencia region over the summer of 1904, and were a reaction against realist art.  He produced some 15 paintings in this period that varied the present frieze-like composition of figures and horses (see fig.  1), experimenting in each one with combinations of brilliant primary colours.  Other paintings in the series included large-scale paintings of single female figures which dissolve, in their riot of colour and patterning, into almost pure ornamental abstraction.  Indeed critics have frequently pointed out that in the artificiality, brilliance and luminosity of their colours, Anglada's paintings ressemble mosaics -- a quality evident in the present work in the women's dresses and the horses' caparisons.  Louis Wauxcelles, for example, the critic who coined the phrase \"Fauve\", said that Anglada's painting of the period had an almost Byzantine quality.  As Manuel Garcia Guatas writes: \"The female figures, and their apparently conventional representation as Valencians, Sevillans, Granadans, or Madrilenas, were nothing but excuses to show off an intense and decorative palette, studded with visual effects similar to a sea of coral and exotic fish. . . The tassled shawl, combed mantilla and large fan are the three ornamental pieces with which Anglada dresses his women, and the floral dresses or bushy trees -- displayed like peacocks' tails -- provide the only spatial reference.  With these tools Anglada creates the total decorative synthesis of his canvases. \" (Anglada Camarasa, exh.  cat. , Madrid, 2002, pp.  37-38). "}}

Archivio storico Ricordi.  Ferdinando Fontana (30 January 1850 - 10 May 1919) was an Italian journalist, dramatist, and poet.

Notice in(1884) announcing Ricordi 's publication ofand their contract with Puccini to write a second opera with Fontana.  Born at Milan into a family of artists - both his father Carlo and his brother Roberto were painters - he entered a Barnabite school at the age of seven and then went on to study at the Collegio Zambelli.  He was forced to abandon his studies while still young to provide for himself and his two younger sisters following the death of their mother.  During that period, he worked in a series of menial jobs before becoming a copy editor for the newspaper Corriere di Milano.  This brought him into contact with the world of journalism and literature, which was to become his career.  An exponent of the second Scapigliatura artistic movement, Fontana was a very versatile writer.  Apart from his plays and opera libretti, he wrote poems (in both Italian and Milanese dialect), travel books, and articles in various Italian newspapers, including Corriere della Sera.  From 1878 to 1879 he was the Berlin correspondent for the Gazzetta Piemontese (today La Stampa).  During his time in Milan, Fontana wrote two plays in Milanese dialect, La Pina Madamin and La Statoa del scior Incioda.  Both had considerable success and starred Edoardo Ferravilla, considered one of the greatest comic actors in Milanese theatre.  He wrote numerous libretti, including two for Alberto Franchetti (Asrael and Zoroastro) and two for Puccini (Le Villi and Edgar).  He also translated several operetta libretti for performance in Italy, including Franz Lehar's Die lustige Witwe (The Merry Widow) and Der Graf von Luxemburg (The Count of Luxembourg), Oskar Nedbal's Polenblut (Polish Blood), and Edmund Eysler's Der Frauenfresser (The Woman-Eater).  Early in his career, Fontana's output was prodigious: an 1886 article in La Stampa said that at the time, 13 new libretti by Fontana were being composed by 12 different composers. A committed and passionate socialist, he took part in the Milanese demonstrations in 1898 which led to the Bava-Beccaris massacre.  Because of the repressions which followed, he fled to Switzerland where he first lived in Montagnola, a small town near Lugano.  He remained in Switzerland until his death, living a modest life, and greatly reducing his literary activities.  Ferdinando Fontana died in Lugano in 1919, at the age of 69.

From the 1880s Dagnan-Bouveret along with Gustave Courtois, maintained a studio in Neuilly-sur-Seine, a fashionable suburb of Paris.  By that time he was recognized as a leading modern artist known for his peasant scenes, but also for his mystical-religious compositions.  His large-scale painting \"The Last Supper\" was exhibited at the Salon de Champ-de-Mars in 1896.

Like all young Frenchmen at the time, his career was temporarily derailed by the Franco-Prussian War and the Paris Commune of 1870-71, but he resumed his education in 1872, settling comfortably into the studio of Jean-Leon Gerome.  In 1875, Dagnan-Bouveret debuted at the Salon with a depiction of the triumphant Atalanta, the Greek heroine who bested all her male competitors in a footrace.  In addition to the standard Beaux-Arts curriculum in Geromes studio, Dagnan-Bouveret also learned how to use photography as a tool, both for organizing a composition and for keeping a record of potentially useful visual images.  Although photography was still a fledgling technique in the 1870s, it would become a crucial tool for many artists later in the century.  Many of Dagnan-Bouverets paintings reveal the use of thoughtfully posed photographs, combined with traditional compositional sketches in ink or pencil, as the basis for the finished work. [i] In fact, key paintings such as Horses at the Watering Trough, 1884, or The Pardon in Brittany, 1886, were painstakingly developed through preparatory photographs and drawings that were ultimately transferred onto the final canvas.  Dagnan-Bouverets work also reveals a carefully crafted fusion of classical academic training with subject matter that is based on the everyday life of ordinary people.  As a young artist in 1870s Paris, he was undoubtedly aware of Realist painters such as Gustave Courbet or Francois Bonvin, but the Dutch genre tradition of illustrating domestic scenes and rural life may have been equally influential.  The 1879 painting entitled The Accident, for example, is set in a modest rural interior where a young boy sits anxiously on a chair while a doctor wraps his wounded arm.  Unpretentious copper pitchers and pots gleam on the mantel above a massive hearth, while the extended family gathers around a trestle table to watch the medical procedure.  Their ragged clothes are a marked contrast to the more fashionable--and prosperous--suit that the doctor wears.  This type of narrative painting is immediately clear to any viewer regardless of educational background; understanding the story does not depend on knowledge of classical Greek and Roman literature.  Similarly, Dagnan-Bouveret embraced the Realist dictum to paint 'modern life.  In the ink drawing of A Bird Charmer in the Tuileries Gardens, 1879, he created a beguiling image of contemporary Parisian street life.  A year later, in The Laundress, he inserts himself and his close friend Gustave Courtois into an enigmatic scene of a weary young laundress seated on a park bench.  As she rests from her labors, the distinctive figures of Dagnan-Bouveret and Courtois stroll through the autumn cityscape, seemingly oblivious to the attractive young woman.  In both of these images, the artist rejects sentimental commentary, refusing to impose any interpretation, but instead asking the viewer to determine the meaning.  With his career firmly launched by the late 1870s, Dagnan-Bouveret turned his attention to more personal matters when he married Courtois cousin, Anne-Marie, in 1879.  The couple met during the artists numerous visits to his friends home in the Franch-Comte, and it was to this region that Dagnan-Bouveret would return repeatedly in the decades to come.  Anne-Maries influence on her husbands work is especially evident in the religious images that begin to appear in the 1880s and eventually become the primary theme of his work.  Throughout the 1880s and 1890s, Dagnan-Bouveret developed a very successful career in a variety of genres; he continued to create naturalist images of daily life, both urban and rural, and increasingly focusing on religious painting.  In 1886, he began a series of paintings on the theme of the Breton custom of the \"pardon\", an annual pilgrimage associated with the feast day of the patron saint of a local church.  Clothed in traditional Breton costumes, pilgrims would gather on the eve of the feast day for confession, and then rise for early morning mass and a day of prayer.  Following the worship services, they walked in procession around the church where others who wished to offer prayers of gratitude could join in, often carrying objects such as crutches that were no longer needed.  This unique combination of theatricality, unsullied rural custom, and Christian piety were appealing not only to Dagnan-Bouveret, but also to the countless other artists who would travel to Brittany in the closing years of the nineteenth century.  The series of paintings on the Brittany pardons also opened the door for Dagnan-Bouverets exploration of other religious subjects.  In the late 1880s, he began creating paintings of the Madonna, using the renaissance example of Raphael as inspiration, but transforming the image into a contemporary Symbolist meditation.  The Consolatrix Afflictorium (The Consoling Madonna) of 1899 depicts a mystically lit forest where the Madonna and Child, surrounded by angels, offer divine comfort to a kneeling man.  This message of solace found a ready buyer in the American art collector Henry Clay Frick, who had recently lost his young son. [ii] At the Exposition Universelle of 1900, Dagnan-Bouverets status as a respected artistic leader enabled him to showcase his paintings, including The Lords Last Supper, in a separate installation on the fair grounds.  The size of this work, at nearly 10 x 18 feet, was intended to create a sense of immediacy, as if the viewer were a witness to the crucial Thursday evening meal.  As with his Madonna paintings, Dagnan-Bouveret based the composition of The Lords Last Supper on renaissance models, but the mystical lighting spotlights very contemporary French faces on the apostles.  In November of 1900, Dagnan-Bouverets was elected to the Academie des Beaux-Arts of the Institut de France, one of the youngest painters to ever receive this honor.  Although often overwhelmed by the swift developments of modernism in the opening decades of the twentieth century, he continued to paint religious images as well as portraits until his death in 1929.  In the twenty-first century, his work has been reevaluated--and celebrated--with a 2002 exhibition sponsored by the Dahesh Museum in New York By: Janet Whitmore, Ph. D.

", "article_2": "Pascal-Adolphe-Jean Dagnan-Bouveret, was one of the leading French artists of the naturalist school.  He was born in Paris, the son of a tailor, and was raised by his grandfather after his father emigrated to Brazil.  Later he added his grandfather's name, Bouveret, to his own.  He became one of the leading French artists of the naturalist school and painted several paintings depicting Brittany.  From 1869 he studied at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts under Alexandre Cabanel and Jean-Leon Gerome.  From 1875 he exhibited at the Salon, where in 1880 he won the first-class medal for the painting \"An Accident\" and a medal of honour in 1885 for \"Horses at the Watering Trough\".  From the 1880s Dagnan-Bouveret along with Gustave Courtois, maintained a studio in Neuilly-sur-Seine, a fashionable suburb of Paris.  By that time he was recognized as a leading modern artist known for his peasant scenes, but also for his mystical-religious compositions.  His large-scale painting \"The Last Supper\" was exhibited at the Salon de Champ-de-Mars in 1896.  He was one of the first to use the then new medium of photography to bring greater realism to his paintings.  In 1891 he was made an Officer of the Legion of Honour and in 1900 he became a member of the Institut de France.  A number of his pictures were purchased by the British art collector George McCulloch, including The Madonna and Child 1880, Dans Le Foret, and a copy of La Cene (The Last Supper). ", "article_3": "Following the sudden death of the great and very influential Jules Bastien-Lepage, Pascal Dagnan-Bouveret (1852-1929) was the most distinguished and successful painter in 'Naturalist style.  After an initial visit to Brittany in 1885, Dagnan-Bouveret turned his attention to that most westerly part of France, a complete change from his earlier works from the Franche-Comte region in the far east of the country.  Like the older Jules Breton, Dagnan-Bouveret was fascinated by the extensive religious pilgrimages known as pardons, but does not seem to have attempted to paint large gatherings of pilgrims in a full-scale pardon, like Breton.  His first painting showing those attending a pardon was completed in 1886, as The Pardon in Brittany.  Dagnan-Bouveret shows men and women of all ages walking barefoot, holding lighted candles.  The older man with a stick to the left of centre is strongly reminiscent of some in Bretons earlier paintings of pardons.  This painting was awarded a medal of honour at the Exposition Universelle in 1889.  Dagnan-Bouveret prepared for these works conventionally, with studies such as this Portrait of a Breton Girl (1887), and using the radically new technique of photography, and was one of the first painters to employ photography in the production of his paintings.  Bretons at a Pardon (1887) shows a group of Breton women attending the Pardon of Rumengol, which takes place in this village to the east of Faou.  At least one of the photographs which he took when developing this work survives, but was unsuitable for inclusion here.  Dagnan-Bouveret painted a series of modern interpretations of traditional religious works.  Among them is his profoundly beautiful Madonna of the Trellis (1888), which shows the Virgin Mary embracing the infant Christ under trellis work with dense foliage.  It departs from artistic tradition in that the Madonna is dressed in white, rather than classical ultramarine blue, and has a contemporary appearance.  In 1888, Dagnan-Bouveret, Louis-Auguste Girardot and Jules-Alexis Muenier visited Tetouan in Morocco together, although Dagnan-Bouveret doesnt appear to have left any surviving Orientalist paintings from that trip.  He also painted some modern history works, of which the most famous is Conscripts (1889).  This shows a group of young men who have just been conscripted into the army, marching behind a very non-military drummer and a boy bearing the national flag.  The conscripts walk with their arms linked to express their solidarity.  Dagnan-Bouveret delayed exhibiting this painting for two years, then in 1891 it stole the show at the re-organised Salon run by the Societe Nationale des Beaux-Arts.  It became a runaway success, and a focus for French nationalism.  Dagnan-Bouveret was at the height of his Naturalism by the early 1890s, and painted another well-known example, his In the Forest of 1893.  This shows a group of itinerant people sat together, eating to the sound of a violin.  Behind them are two oxen, and the forest which is currently their home.  After these two paintings, Dagnan-Bouveret abandoned Naturalism and concentrated his efforts on religious works.  The Last Supper (1896) is probably his most spectacular religious painting, which again follows the artistic tradition in most respects, but with more contemporary figures.  Christ is shown blessing the bread and wine, lit from a rich source which doesnt appear in the painting.  Christ and the Disciples at Emmaus (1896-97) shows an earlier meal during Christs ministry, using more contemporary figures and looking into the light.  This gives Christ a heavenly radiance, lighting his hair in particular.  Dagnan-Bouveret uses light to further dramatic effect in his Marguerite at the Sabbath (1911), inspired by the fate of Gretchen/Margaret in Goethes Faust.  After the birth of her illegitimate child, Margaret drowns the infant in despair, and is shown here clutching his limp body.  This is set at the witches Sabbath on Walpurgis Night, lit by the flames of a bonfire.  Saint-Trophime in Arles (1914) appears to be a straightforward townscape of the centre of Arles, showing the celebrated ancient Romanesque church of Saint Trophime at the right.  When Dagnan-Bouveret turned seventy in 1922, he painted this wonderful portrait of Old Julie, from Quincey, in the Franche-Comte, where the artist lived; he died there seven years later in 1929.  More recent re-assessment of the works of Bastien-Lepage and Dagnan-Bouveret propose that they should be considered together, on a par, as the leaders of the Naturalist movement.  History may not have done Bastien-Lepage many favours, but it has been of even greater disservice to Dagnan-Bouveret. "}}

He focused primarily on the countryside of southern France, infusing his landscapes, always painted outdoors (en plein air), with light and color.  Didier-Pouget is associated with the later phase of Impressionism, although not actually identified with the group of artists typically known as the Impressionists. His career as an exhibiting artist stems from 1886 onwards. He was a member of the Societe des Artistes Francais, a member of l'Ecole de Crozant and Societe des peintres de montagne. Also, laureate of l'Institut au Concours Troyon, Officer of the order of Nichan Iftikar (Order of Glory, Tunisia), and Officer of the Legion of Honour. William Didier-Pouget was born in Toulouse.  He was the son of a newspaper editor.  Antoine Paul Jules Edgar Pouget, a nature lover, encouraged William in his ambition to become an artist.  The two would often take long walks together, the elder pointing out natural phenomena while discussing methods of their pictorial representation.  He related biographical details of the great artists, past and present, and in every possible way trained the boy while rousing his ambition. Didier-Pouget began his formal art training at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in the city of Toulouse.  He later studied at the Academie de Paris with Amedee (Jean Amedee) Baudit (1826-1890), a French landscape painter, and made his debut at the Salon de Paris in 1886.  He later studied with Louis-Augustin Auguin, an associate of Gustave Courbet and Jean-Baptiste Corot.  Ultimately, Didier-Pouget was accepted into the studio of Maxime Lalanne, the celebrated artist, illustrator and etcher.  Under these influences many profitable years followed.  The seeds were sown for what would become Didier-Pouget's fruitful career as an artist. William Didier-Pouget married Caroline Salley (1863-1949) and had a daughter, Yvonne (1885-1971).  Yvonne Aubert-Didier-Pouget (aka Charline Abbeille) became an artist painter and miniaturist. Matinee dans le Limousin, Bruyeres en fleurs (Bergere), oil on canvas, 240 x 170 cm William Didier-Pouget, ca. 1909,), oil on canvas, 240 x 170 cm Matinee dans le Limousin, Bruyeres en fleurs, postcard, Salon 1910 William Didier-Pouget,, postcard, Salon 1910 In Toulouse, the young artist had already been regarded as a prodigy of talent, and great things were expected of him.  Paintings were exhibited in the provinces, attracting much attention, and found many purchasers.  Encouraged, Didier-Pouget sought a wider audience, and moved to Paris; a wise step for his career.  From 1886 he exhibited regularly at the Salons, each new season showing a marked advancement in his art, \"bringing to the world of Paris new and delightful colour-schemes and vivid compositions. \" During his early years Didier-Pouget's landscape paintings were temperate and ethereal with a poetic atmosphere.  Progressively he began to specialize in a style that would build his considerable reputation all the way to the United States, with many commissioned works both at home and abroad.  The artist took pleasure in expressing the tranquil ambiance of river scenes.  The soft poesy of his mountainous landscapes are suggestive of Auguin, a disciple of Corot.  Didier-Pouget, part of the same school, had cultivated from their groundwork the idea of leaving the foreground largely unobstructed.  The importance he attaches to the tree is eloquent; representing for him the opacity of the earth in contrast to the unburdened transparency of the sky, with its silhouette projected onto the horizon.  The strong bichromy of his paintings evokes the short time span of the twilight, just after sunset or before the sunrise. Didier-Pouget excelled in depicting morning and sunset effects.  \"His scenes of heather bathed in sunshine or glistening with the dew of an autumnal sunrise are rendered with an exceptional verisimilitude, strength, and truth\", wrote Wynford Dewhurst in 1901. Le soir dans les Hautes Pyrenees, Salon 1904, postcard William Didier-Pouget,, Salon 1904, postcard During the height of his career, Didier-Pouget's favorite subjects were beautiful fields of heather in the fog, forests filled with light, plateaus in the Creuse Valley, and the Dordogne River winding through the hills.  His clients at the time included George I of Greece, Carnegie Museum, the embassy at Saint-Petersbourg, conseil municipal au Capitule de Toulouse, Musee des Ursulines de Macon, Palais des Beaux-Arts de la Ville de Paris (Petit Palais), Conseil Municipal de l'Hotel de Ville (Saint-Bertrand-de-Comminges), and Raymond Poincare (president of France from 1913 to 1920). In April 1903, Didier-Pouget exhibited in the United States at the Newark (NJ) Library Art Gallery, and was mentioned in the New-York Tribune, 20 April 1903.  The exhibition was organized by George A.  Dowden. Wynford Dewhurst wrote again of Didier-Pouget in 1904: \"If the greatest art is to represent an impression of Nature at her best, then the work of Didier-Pouget is great.  'It is truly worth while being a painter to have produced any one of these,' writes the critic of Le Temps.  The artist loves best to represent Nature in her peaceful moods, and generally seeks the solitudes of the exquisite hills, valleys, and rivers of the Tarbes countryside, or the rich watershed of La Creuse.  Here, in the fresh early-morn, charged with dew and mist, he finds his subjects, overlooking magnificent panoramas of river, hillsides covered with heather, across valleys and plains from which loom out sculpturesque masses of foliage, dark and strong against the blue mist and distant mountain ridge.  The painter prefers Nature serene and undisturbed, and introduces but little incident. \" He paints the twilight with passion, the waters that glide capriciously beneath the greenery, the flowering heather, the marvelous heather. . . for the pleasure of the eye [. . . ] These fine droplets that illuminate spontaneous bursts of light in the works of Theodore Rousseau, or the delicate incandescent aura of Camille Corot, are revealed in Didier-Pouget.

Didier-Pouget was named Knight of the Legion of Honour by decree on 15 January 1901 (breveted: 23 March 1901; ceremony: 28 February 1901). He exhibited at various venues and won the gold medal at the Exposition universelle et internationale (1913).  He was subsequently selected as a member of the Jury and became a senior member of the Societe des Artistes Francais.  Didier-Pouget at this time was living in a large studio at 12 Boulevard de Clichy, Paris.  By decree on 18 July 1933, Didier-Pouget was promoted to Officier of the Legion of Honour by the President of the France's Third Republic, Albert Francois Lebrun (1932 - 1940).

He later studied at the Academy of Paris under the famed French landscape painter, Jean Baudit.  The painting he entered for his first exhibition, the Salon of 1866, seems atypical of his work in that it was a rather somber image; however, it did foreshadow the direction of the artist's oeuvre in the attention paid to atmospheric elements.  It was the countryside of Southern France that eventually led Didier-Pouget to focus on light and color in his landscapes.  During his career, he developed a niche for translating the beauty of a field of flowers, a forest filled with trees, heathers with fog, plateaus in the Creuse valley, and the Dordogne river, onto a canvas.  He found success participating in various exhibitions, and after winning the gold medal in 1913 at the Exposition Universelle, he was selected as a member of the Jury as well as a permanent senior member of the Societe des Artistes Francais.

Celan asks Daive to translate some of his poetry; Daive agrees.  Composed about 20 years later and published in 1996--as the fifth volume in Daives continuing series-project La Condition dinfini (The Infinite Condition)--Sous la coupole hauntingly traces in elliptical concentric circles the two poet-translators working relationship and friendship that lasted from 1965 until Celans April 20, 1970 suicide.  In the mode or form of temporal recurrence and echo, musical theme and variation; in movements that seem never to have started from any single defined point of origin but that course like memory waves: we read and hear, once and again--yet differently, even when incidents and occasions might appear the same--of their innumerable work sessions, often a return in remembered-time to the same session.  The echoes are not only of whats already come, in Under the Dome, but also of many of the Celan poems necessarily folded into the books music-like memory-structure.  Indeed, the connections between this iterative movement and translation itself are enacted as, into, Daives poetics.  We read of work sessions that are followed by. . .  walks and talks; coffees followed or preceded by. . .  walks and talks; dinners that come after yet still precede more. . .  walks and talks; and--sometimes, just simply--walks and talks.  With silence a crucial component of what it means to walk, to talk, to put the two into relation.  World and poetry too are distinct, with the how? of their mutual engagement an ever-present question.  \"His silence is an electric switch,\" Daive writes of Celan, a \"commutateur,\" because it redirects the flow of current, translating speech, changing the direction (sens)--and the sense (sens)--of communication.  The \"dome\" of the books title refers in the first place to the shade-shelter formed by the trees foliage, the \"foliage\" that, in French and German, among other languages, yields terms that can signify \"leaf\" or \"page\": feuille; Blatt.  The trees--primarily chestnut and paulownia--that populate the Place de la Contrescarpe in Paris Fifth Arrondissement where Celan lives, and in whose streets and cafes Celan and Daive delight to stroll, to think aloud, to work: these trees and their leaves generate--and in turn offer the poet-translators a generative--dome.  The leafy dome of the Contrescarpe becomes one of those particularized \"somewheres\" that together make up the collective yet differentiated \"everywhere\" Rothenberg refers to above.  The Contrescarpe is somewhere for these two poets and their two-and-more languages to meet, but its dome is not a container.  It is fitting that the feuilles and Blatter are now, via the inevitable Whitmanian pun, projecting their shadows in English.  \"The secret is in these leaves,\" Waldrop translates, echoing in a minor key the opening of Leaves of Grass: \"Have you felt so proud to get at the meaning of poems?\" Daive and Celans walks are quite different from Whitmans loafing; the American poets confidence that the pages of the poem might adequately gloss the leaves of the world has notably withered.  And yet, Celan himself recognized how his own view that there is \"no basic difference between a poem and a handshake\" resonated with Whitmans assertion, \"Camerado, this is no book,/who touches this touches a man\"--a transatlantic solidarity that runs all the deeper for the spectral quality of these person-to-person contacts.  The \"dome\" of the books title refers in the first place to the shade-shelter formed by the trees foliage, the \"foliage\" that, in French and German, among other languages, yields terms that can signify \"leaf\" or \"page. \" Another of those lines from Leaves of Grass: \"Have you practisd so long to learn to read?\" Our experience, of reading--and reading the \"reading-matter\" of all kinds in the somewheres that make up everywhere--announces itself as our co-participation in Under the Domes initial moment when we read (in our first encounter with this book, and with Celan) about Celan reading in order to engage whats known--or not known, or not yet known--of the world: No matter whom, no matter what, Paul Celan reads no matter where because the word drives him to memory and is the imaginary space where the legibility of the world is acted out.  .  .  The world is illegible and the matter of words engenders a structure: the poem.  Vibration of sense used as energy.  .  .  He reads the newspapers, all of them.  .  .  posters, catalogues, dictionaries and philosophy.  .  .  He reads Rilke, Trakl, Kafka, Heidegger.  Listens to conversations, notes a word heard in a store, in the street.  .  .  The matter of words.  Words as matter.  .  .  * Reading Daive or Celan could never be described as \"a walk in the park\"--not for readers of French and German, and not even for the two poets themselves, who read each other between such strolls.  English-reading audiences have had access, periodically, to parts of Daives oeuvre; a good deal more of it has appeared as the result of a number of co-translations he and the Canadian-U. S.  poet Norma Cole have done of one anothers work during the last decade.  Celans presence in English goes further back but the trials of his translators have not ceased to be daunting.  So theres an almost perfect bookending--though happily, not an ending--to whats constructed in 1959 by New Young German Poets: that since at least the early 1990s, Rothenbergs collaborator on the ongoing anthology series Poems for the Millennium has been the French-born, Luxembourg-raised poet and translator Pierre Joris, whos moved among Europe, North Africa, and the U. S.  for the better part of six decades, prolifically translating among French, German, English, Arabic, and other languages.  A crucial portion of Joris work has involved bringing more and more of Celans poetry and critical writing closer to the kind of English translations they demand.  No ones expressed the judgment better than Mary Ann Caws: \"Without simplifying, aiming at anything elegantly 'poetic, or condensing Celans anxiously layered otherness, Joris has gotten right to its grayness, what Celan calls 'the darkness of the poem today. . .  a language fragment. . .  freighted with world. \" That the fragments of language themselves--the splintered syntax and fractured words--bear the world as their freight is a lesson that Rosmarie Waldrops own attentive effort to transport Daives words into English helps us understand.  When the text turns to Daives own experience translating Celans German into French, Waldrop has the unenviable job of translating the translation, with all the possible losses such a layering implies.  In such a situation, does the translator return to \"the original,\" working from the German verse that Daive had himself translated into French? Or is the origin no longer unambiguously Celan, such that the English translation should heed the diction and syntax of Daives French, irrespective of its German precedent? And, whatever she decides, how might the translator signal the difference, her choice and its alternative? Waldrop faces such hard decisions several times in Under the Dome, and the variety in her choice of solutions illuminates the world with which this poetry is freighted.  Thus, when reckoning with Daives translation of the 1959 poem \"Engfuhrung,\" Waldrop replaces the title of Daives translation with Celans original German.  However, when Daive quotes from his own translation, reprinting its opening verses \"De-porte dans letendue,\" Waldrop does not return to the German text from which Daive is translating, nor does she translate Daives French into English.  Daives translation is left untranslated.  If Under the Dome is indeed \"translated from the French,\" then \"De-porte dans letendue\" is either untranslatable, or it isnt French.  A \"language fragment.  .  .  freighted with world\": Mary Ann Caws praise for Pierre Joris translation work cites a note Celan made about how the poem comes to us today.  It comes \"freighted\" (\"befrachtet\"): loaded, as one loads a train car with merchandise.  \"Freighted with world\" is ironic, dark, and less metaphorical than one would think, since, although en route, the merchandises eventual exchangeability is in question, the translatability of the world uncertain.  \"De-porte\" is already one of these language fragments, a word that Daive splits in two and disposes like the linked wagons of a freight train.  As the translation of the lines \"Verbracht ins/Gelande\"--which Pierre Joris renders as \"Brought into/the terrain\"--Daives \"De-porte dans letendue\" was subjected to fierce critique when it was first published in the Mercure de France in 1971 because of its violent treatment of the word \"verbracht,\" a participle that usually denotes a passage of time and that commands the sense of \"deport. \" (deported) only in the reports of a bureaucrat.  Technically, \"verbracht\" does not count among the many \"Komposita\" that Celan threads through his poetry, and yet Daives translation reads it as such a composite, breaking it down and translating the fragments piecemeal: \"ver-\" (de-), \"-bracht\" (-porte).  Of course, parsing \"ver-bracht\" as \"de-port. \" makes plain the history which Celans poem leaves implicit: in French, \"la deportation\" refers explicitly to the German-operated network of freight trains that carried Jews like Celans parents to their deaths in concentration camps.  As Waldrop translates, \"my parents died deported. \" Reading Daive or Celan could never be described as \"a walk in the park\"--not for readers of French and German, and not even for the two poets themselves, who read each other between such strolls.  How, then, to translate Daives \"De-porte\"? Certainly, the cognate \"deported\" or \"de-ported\" offers itself.  Less historically specific than \"deporte\" \"deported\" expands the range of reference, opening the poem onto a longer, ongoing history of state violence.  But it forgoes the gamble of Daives direct invocation of the genocide, a roll of the \"die\" (de) which risks losing the German so that it may name the vanished world with which that language is nonetheless freighted.  Violently glossing the historical rupture by which the euphemistic, Eichmannian \"verbracht\" became, in effect, an other German--a lexeme in what Victor Klemperer called the Lingua Tertii Imperii--Daives French bears witness to the loss of Celans mother tongue, pointing to the unsayable difference that distinguishes the language he shared with his mother (verbracht) from the language in which her murder was commissioned (ver-bracht).  That the repetition of this loss is what is at stake in the translation is evident from Daives recollection of the \"violent stroke across the paper\" with which Celan sanctions Daives solution.  Under the Dome is full of such convulsive motions: lightning flashes, the gambler throws the dice, the engraver defaces the plate, and the poem, we learn, \"crosses out the world. \" By courting destitution, however, all of these gestures refer us back to this paradoxical movement of (self-)translation, whereby Celan \"authorizes\" his poems exile into French and thus becomes the \"author\" of his own linguistic dispossession.  \"Have you ever thought of writing in another language?. . .  Yes, sometimes, in French. . .  But it is not possible. \" What is not possible in writing, however, may be possible in translation.  Contrary to received wisdom, translation can have a generative relationship to its alleged impossibility.  Here, for instance, the impossibility of writing in French opens up the singular possibility of mourning the loss of German in the translation.  And in English? It tells us a lot about the layers of language and memory that make up Under the Domes vault that Waldrop declines to translate \"De-porte dans letendue\" as she translates the rest of Daives French.  Here, Daive does more than transmit the sense of \"Verbracht ins/Gelande\"; the violent dislocation of French morphology bears the trace of the crime--\"das Verbrechen\"--that echoes in the German.  Waldrop, translating the French, is thus justified in leaving this language fragment \"in the original,\" since this French is not only French.  It is freighted with Celans German, which, though deported into French, retains its \"unmistakable trace. \" \"With the unmistakable trace\" is the third verse of \"Engfuhrung. \" The fourth, \"Grass written asunder,\" produces another unexpected echo of Whitmans master trope--this time turned inside out.  Writing scatters the leaves.  Its track winds through the mute spaces between.  Such negative spaces are also suggested by the texts titular dome.  In addition to naming the luminous canopy of the Contrescarpe, Daives dome translates the \"vault\" of Celans 1967 poem \"Grosse gluhende Wolbung\" (Vast, glowing vault).  The vault of that poem is no sheltering sky; indeed, the abyss opened up by receding constellations seems to consume the shared world.  In \"Vast, glowing vault,\" a form of relation persists despite this withdrawal, manifesting itself as an unworldly obligation to the other.  That poems vision of an ethical relation that survives catastrophe helps explain why its final line, \"Die Welt ist fort, ich mussdich tragen\" (The world is gone, I must carry you), reverberates throughout Daives recollection of his friend.  An early variation on the theme appears in the texts original French edition as: Le verbe nest plus.  Le monde nest plus (fort).  Il faut que je te porte.  Lines which Waldrop translates as: The word is no more, The world is no more (no stronger).  I have to carry you.  The withdrawal of the word and the world has obvious Biblical overtones.  In this translated memoire of translation especially, the absence of \"verbe\" and \"monde\" also resonate plainly with Waldrops task as a translator (the connection is not incidental: in Celans Bible, we learn, the seventh day is set aside for translation).  Under the Dome is full of such convulsive motions: lightning flashes, the gambler throws the dice, the engraver defaces the plate, and the poem, we learn, \"crosses out the world. \" Left behind in the movement from Celans \"Welt\" to Daives \"monde\" and then to Waldrops \"world,\" the word is not only literally absent; its absence seems to be compounding.  The originals disappearance in the translation had already been recalled in Daives \"Le monde nest plus (fort),\" which appends the missing \"fort\" (gone) from \"Die Welt ist fort\" to the end of the French verse.  Of course, Daives \"fort\" does not restore Celans word, though the mournful reminder might give French the strength to bear its absence.  Translation implies loss, always; the real question is, how does the translation carry its losses? Paradoxically, a translation grows stronger as a translation for coming to terms with what cannot be retrieved.  Waldrops translation does just this, conjuring the strength to carry the vanished world \"under the dome\" out of the eclipse of that strength and the loss of that world.  Her translation reads in Daives \"(fort)\" not just the German adjective predicating absence (fort) but the French adjective signifying strength (fort).  The interlingual pun does not translate well in English, nor is non-translation a viable option as it had been with \"De-porte. \" \"Fort\" has its English meaning too, one which would draw energy from the electrical switch that toggles between Daives \"strong\" and Celans \"gone. \" Additionally, Daives line, although freighted with Celans diction, remains fluent French, its parenthesis resolvable into correct French syntax.  \"Le monde nest plus fort\" (The world is no longer strong. ) Waldrops English, by contrast, possesses no such fluency.  The bilingual pun translates as an English stutter.  \"The world is no more (no stronger). \" Waldrops version trips over the repeated negation as over the memory of the missing French and German.  No. . .  no. . .  No longer. . .  no stronger. . .  Not French. . .  not German.  The circuit is broken, but the hiatus is charged with relation.  The target language quakes with the transferred load.  \"The stutter cuts and can reestablish the current,\" Daive recalls Celan saying.  \"[It] is in itself an outlet of current, but also a draft of air in our current of life. \" __________________________________ From Under the Dome: Walks with Paul Celan by Jean Daive, translated by Rosmarie Waldrop with an introduction by Robert Kaufman and Philip Gerard.

He is best known for having composed music based around only one pitch, altered in all manners through microtonal oscillations, harmonic allusions, and changes in timbre and dynamics, as paradigmatically exemplified in his Quattro pezzi su una nota sola (\"Four Pieces on a single note\", 1959). This composition remains his most famous work and one of the few performed to significant recognition during his lifetime.  His musical output, which encompassed all Western classical genres except scenic music, remained largely undiscovered even within contemporary musical circles during most of his life.  Today, some of his music has gained popularity in certain postmodern composition circles, with pieces like his \"Anahit\" and his String Quartets rising to increased prominence.  Scelsi collaborated with American composers including John Cage, Morton Feldman, and Earle Brown, as well as being a friend and a mentor to Alvin Curran.  His work was a source of inspiration to Ennio Morricone's Gruppo di Improvvisazione di Nuova Consonanza, and his music influenced composers like Tristan Murail and Solange Ancona. Born in the village of Pitelli near La Spezia, Scelsi spent most of his time in his mother's old castle where he received education from a private tutor who taught him Latin, chess and fencing.  Later, his family moved to Rome and his musical talents were encouraged by private lessons with Giacinto Sallustio.  In Vienna, he studied with Walther Klein, a pupil of Arnold Schoenberg.  He became the first exponent of dodecaphony in Italy, although he did not continue to use this system.  In the 1920s, Scelsi made friends with intellectuals like Jean Cocteau and Virginia Woolf, and traveled abroad extensively.  He first came into contact with non-European music in Egypt in 1927.  His first composition was Chemin du coeur (1929).  Then followed Rotativa, first conducted by Pierre Monteux at Salle Pleyel, Paris, on 20 December 1931.  In 1937, he organised a series of concerts of contemporary works, introducing the music of (among others) Paul Hindemith, Schoenberg, Igor Stravinsky, Dmitri Shostakovich, and Sergei Prokofiev to an Italian audience for the first time.  Due to the enforcement of racial laws under the fascist regime of Benito Mussolini, which prevented the performance of works by Jewish composers, these concerts did not continue for long.  Scelsi refused to comply, and gradually distanced himself from Italy.  In 1940, when Italy entered the war, Scelsi was in Switzerland, where he remained until the end of the conflict, composing and honing his conception of music.  He married Dorothy Kate Ramsden, a divorced Englishwoman.  Back in Rome after the war, his wife left him (eventually inspiring Elegia per Ty), and he underwent a profound psychological crisis that eventually led him to the discovery of Eastern spirituality, and also to a radical transformation of his view of music.  In this so-called second period, he rejected the notions of composition and authorship in favour of sheer improvisation.  His improvisations were recorded on tape and later transcribed by collaborators under his guidance.  They were then orchestrated and filled out by his meticulous performance instructions, or adjusted from time to time in close collaboration with the performers.  Scelsi came to conceive of artistic creation as a means of communicating a higher, transcendent reality to the listener.  In this view, the artist is considered a mere intermediary.  For this reason, Scelsi never allowed his image to be shown in connection with his music; he preferred instead to identify himself by a line under a circle, as a symbol of Eastern provenance.  Some photographs of Scelsi have emerged since his death.  One of the earliest interpreters Scelsi closely worked with was the singer Michiko Hirayama, whom he met in 1957 in Rome.  From 1962 to 1972 he wrote the extensive song cycle Canti del Capricorno directly for her in view of her special and unique vocal range.  The writing process of the piece set an example for Scelsi's very personal way of working: developing pieces through improvisation, recording, and then making a final transcription. From the late 1970s, Scelsi met several leading interpreters, such as the Arditti String Quartet, the cellist Frances-Marie Uitti, and the pianists Yvar Mikhashoff and Marianne Schroeder, who have promoted his music all over the world and gradually opened the gates to wider audiences.  Scelsi was a friend and a mentor to Alvin Curran (whose VSTO is a tribute) and other expatriate American composers such as Frederic Rzewski who were residing in Rome during the 1960s. Scelsi also collaborated with other American composers including John Cage, Morton Feldman, and Earle Brown (who visited him in Rome).  Frances-Marie Uitti, dedicatee of all Scelsi's cello works, collaborated intensively with him for over 10 years editing and then recording La Trilogia, a massive 3 part work of 45 minutes in length which Morton Feldman called his \"autobiography in sound\".  It was first premiered in Festival di Como, and recorded on Fore records (Raretone) with Scelsi in the studio and later for Etcetera Records.  A more recent acclaimed version with several of the Latin Prayers is to be found on ECM under the title Natura Renovatur.  Uitti also transcribed many of the chamber works for contrabass, contrabass and cello, viola, and two improvisations based on the ondiolina tapes that are found under the title Voyages.  Alvin Curran recalled that: \"Scelsi . . .  came to all my concerts in Rome even right up to the very last one I gave just a few days before he died.  This was in the summer time, and he was such a nut about being outdoors.  He was there in a fur coat and a fur hat.  It was an outdoor concert.  He waved from a distance, beautiful sparking eyes and smile that he always had, and that's the last time I saw him\" (Ross, 2005).  Scelsi died of a cerebral hemorrhage on 8 August 1988, in Rome. Scelsi remained largely unknown for most of his career.  A series of concerts in the mid to late 1980s finally premiered many of his pieces to great acclaim, notably his orchestral masterpieces in October 1987 in Cologne, about a quarter of a century after those works had been composed and less than a year before the composer's death.  Scelsi was able to attend the premieres and personally supervised the rehearsals.  The impact caused by the late discovery of Scelsi's works was described by Belgian musicologist Harry Halbreich: A whole chapter of recent musical history must be rewritten: the second half of this century is now unthinkable without Scelsi. . .  He has inaugurated a completely new way of making music, hitherto unknown in the West.  In the early fifties, there were few alternatives to serialism's strait jacket that did not lead back to the past.  Then, toward 1960-61, came the shock of the discovery of Ligeti's Apparitions and Atmospheres.  There were few people at the time who knew that Friedrich Cerha, in his orchestral cycle Spiegel, had already reached rather similar results, and nobody knew that there was a composer who had followed the same path even years before, and in a far more radical way: Giacinto Scelsi himself.  Scelsi was also an idol of Ennio Morricone's Gruppo di Improvvisazione di Nuova Consonanza, whose sixteen-minute track 'Omaggio a Giacinto Scelsi' features on their live album 'Musica Su Schemi', released in 1976. The music of Scelsi was heard by millions in Martin Scorsese's Shutter Island, in which excerpts of his two works Quattro pezzi su una nota sola and Uaxuctum (3rd movement) were featured alongside the music of his contemporaries Gyorgy Ligeti, Krzysztof Penderecki, John Cage and Morton Feldman.

Site Search Other Resources News Archive Articles >> Scelsi Giacinto Scelsi Gavin Thomas introduces the work of Giacinto Scelsi (1905--1988).  Overview Overview Count Giacinto Scelsi DAyala Valva, aristocrat, poet and composer, was one of the twentieth centurys more unusual musicians.  Born in 1905, he grew up in the Scelsi familys ancestral castle at Valva, near Naples, where his studies concentrated -- according to the composers own testimony -- on the noble pursuits of fencing, Latin and chess.  His youthful enthusiasms also included the piano, an instrument for which he formed a lifelong affection and at which he developed the habit of improvising for hours at a time -- a strange anticipation of his later composing method.  Although Scelsi never received any formal musical training, as a young man he frequented the house of Respighi in Rome, became an enthusiast for the Futurist music of Luigi Russolo, and later studied briefly in Vienna with a pupil of Schoenberg, writing the first 12-note music to be composed by an Italian.  He subsequently lived in London, where he married a cousin of the queen, and Paris, where he published three volumes of Surrealist poetry in French and established a minor reputation as a maverick composer whose influences ranged from Futurism to Berg and Scriabin.  During these years he also travelled in Asia, in particular to India and Tibet, journeys which would later prove of great significance in his artistic development.  The full facts of Scelsis life are imperfectly known.  Following World War II it appears he suffered an extended nervous breakdown during which, as he would later proudly announce, \"I forgot everything I ever knew about music\".  During his recovery, Scelsi fell into the habit of calming his mind by playing single notes over and over on the piano, a form of musical auto-therapy which was, improbably, to form the basis of his mature compositional style.  He also became an adept of Buddhism, meditating three times daily, adding a Zen symbol to his signature and refusing to allow his photograph to be taken.  In 1959, out of his one-note improvisations, came the seminal Quattro pezzi chiascuno su una nota sola (\"Four pieces each one on a single note\"), the first unequivocal demonstration of Scelsis concern with what he called the \"three-dimensional\" quality of sound.  Each piece takes as its starting (and ending) point a single note -- a radical paring-down of musical subject matter which focuses attention inward, making the listener concentrate on what musical sound is, rather than what it does.  The obvious comparison is with the Eastern musics Scelsi admired - whether the Indian raga or the Tibetan tantra, with their hypnotic concentration on a single elemental sonority -- yet Scelsis strange genius lifts this and all his later work far above the level of mere musical tourism, creating a unique soundworld which is unplaceable in any tradition except its own.  Though none of Scelsis subsequent works shows quite the pyrrhic simplicity of the Quattro pezzi, all are based on what is essentially material of extreme spareness.  Its music which is totally lacking in theme, melody, rhythm and (often) harmony, but which instead confronts the listener with the phenomenom of pure sound in seemingly natural and spontaneous evolution -- the paradox is that (in his finest works at least) Scelsi manages to conjure such luminous musical effects from even the simplest of note-combinations.  Always an extremely prolific composer, Scelsis later music features many pieces for strings especially, including a number of string quartets and the wonderful \"violin concerto\" Anahit, and also for wind instruments, such as the haunting Kya for clarinet and ensemble -- though he gave up writing for his once favoured instrument, the piano, finding its fixed tuning and uniform sound colour too inflexible for his musical needs.  Scelsi also became famous not only for his unique musical style, but also for his unusual working methods, whereby pieces were first improvised -- either by the composer himself at the keyboard or in collaboration with sympathetic performers -- and then written down by amanuenses (in a strange twist, one of Scelsis assistants, the Italian composer Vieru Tosatti, later claimed that he rather than Scelsi was the true author of the works).  Scelsi stopped composing around 1975, but enjoyed belated fame as musicians from all over the world discovered his work.  Article and review pages originally published in The Rough Guide to Classical Music Buy Sheet Music by Scelsi", "article_2": "Giacinto Scelsi was born on January 8th, 1905 to an aristocratic family living on an old estate in the country surrounding Naples in southern Italy.  Though he had little formal musical training, he is now recognized as one of the most creative composers of our century.  Scelsi's mature music is marked by a supreme concentration on single notes, combined with a masterly sense of form.  Scelsi revolutionized the role of sound in western music - his best known work is the Quattro Pezzi per Orchestra, each on a single note.  These single notes are elaborated through microtonal shadings, harmonic allusions, and variations in timbre and dynamics.  It is impossible to express the immense power of this apparently simple music in words.  Scelsi's early music is based in the music of the time: he studied with a pupil of Alban Berg in Vienna, as well as with a follower of Alexander Scriabin in Switzerland.  Though little of this early music is recorded and thus definitive conclusions are impossible, it is easy to notice Scelsi's interest in strict form from the titles of these compositions (ex.  Introduction and Fugue, Variations, etc. ) In addition, the majority of this music was written for the piano: an instrument on which Scelsi was a virtuoso performer.  Scelsi's counterpoint in this period is very strict, making use of dodecaphony and other neo-classic and neo-baroque elements.  Scelsi's paradigm is strict counterpoint defining harmony, in much the same idiom as K.  S.  Sorabji - the comparison of these two figures is highly appropriate for a variety of reasons: position outside the mainstream, pianistic virtuosity, and above all a neo-baroque paradigm within a chromatic framework.  However, Scelsi shows a marked tendency toward thematic compression and brevity which is certainly absent from Sorabji.  During World War II, Scelsi wrote his String Quartet No.  1 (1944) which is one of his most important early compositions.  During this same period, his wife left him and he later underwent some sort of psychological breakdown.  His therapy eventually consisted of playing a single note on a piano over and over again, and this was to lead the way to his new style.  The last work which Scelsi composed during his First Period was the cantata La Nascita del Verbo (1948), and this piece continued to have profound implications (though apparently not pleasant ones) for him when it was performed in 1950.  The cantata has not been performed since then, and remains Scelsi's most important unrecorded work.  Hence, it was with a profound knowledge of form, counterpoint, and the musical directions of his time that Scelsi was to begin his Second Period.  Here the musical ideas of the East and India in particular suddenly play a large role in his music - the result being an immense intensification of the power of the single sound.  When Scelsi began composing again in 1952, he turned immediately to his own instrument: the piano, and produced a quick succession of suites and other sets of pieces.  There is now an emphasis on the repetition of notes, leading to ostinato formations and incorporating clusters, resonance effects, subtle harmony and toccata structures.  Several passages have resemblance to the late piano style of Scriabin, but in addition there is a far-flung, almost encyclopedic range of references to other musics both western and beyond.  Here the allusions can be quite subtle and difficult to place - in fact, considering that these piano suites most likely were notated from Scelsi's improvisations, it is likely that these references emerge entirely subconsciously.  There is an increasing preoccupation with formal symmetries, especially those based on the golden mean and during the most violent harmonic passages, there is an underlying feeling of peace - something which makes this music sound quite different from that of Bartok, regardless of the similarity in language used to describe it - culminating in the Peace Suite, No.  9 (1953), and serving as a foundation for Scelsi's further exploration of sound in the Quattro Illustrazioni of the same year.  This piano music accomplishes the beginning of a revolution in Scelsi's music in which extreme power and tension can be drawn from a single note.  Already the context can be quite dramatic as in the thrashing of Varaha, and resonance plays a large role - as it no doubt did for Scelsi during his long recovery from western musical malaise during which he played his single note over and over again and listened to the resonance and decay, and most importantly the lack of uniformity even within a single sound.  This is really Scelsi's most profound realization: that a single sound is not a musical point in any real sense, it is a dynamic entity shaped by a variety of influences, and it is to his glory that he not only realized this fact but set it to music in a way that no one else has ever done.  By the mid-50s, Scelsi was to totally abandon the piano which had until then been his most important means of expression.  This must have been very difficult for him, but at the same time freed him even more from his earlier thoughts: by then he had truly forgotten everything.  It was also necessary to move to instruments accommodating microtones, string in particular, in order to completely realize his new musical ideas.  Hence the piano music does not reveal Scelsi in his later phases, but it still contains some masterful and above all purely pianistic writing which should not be neglected.  One thing which had been accomplished in Scelsi's piano music, and particularly in the Suite No.  10, was that a single tone could be changed in pitch without losing its identity as the same tone.  In the world of equal temperament, this was done by shifting the harmonic context intact with the shift of the note, usually accomplished via ostinato.  Obviously, this idea takes on even more promise using microtonal glissandi and it is in this interior chromaticism that Scelsi really redefines music - any notion of \"perfect pitch\" becomes not only unnecessary, but a real handicap to following the ebb and flow of the music.  In the mid-50s, Scelsi returns to string writing (which he had used sparingly in his First Period) with a series of Divertimenti for solo violin.  The title of Divertimento is interesting for what it brings in the music: this is purely tonal music written in traditional style (obviously derived primarily from Bach's solo violin Sonatas) and incorporating virtuosic playing.  The Divertimento No.  3 has been recorded, and is yet another masterpiece in the tonal idiom - this music has an intense and timeless quality (perhaps most closely akin to the solo violin sonatas of Ysaye) and is really a sonata (in four movements) of great scope and invention.  The fact that Scelsi could write such fine violin music (and these 'divertimenti' are arguably the finest in this idiom since Bach) is quite astounding - and shows again that Scelsi is far from abandoning tradition.  Scelsi was fifty years old in 1955, and in the midst of establishing his epoch-making style which was to yield a succession of individual masterpieces in the 1960s.  Though his aristocratic position freed him from financial worries, his emotional life must have been difficult indeed marked as it was by extreme self-criticism and now by a completely solitary existence.  He had traveled extensively in India and Nepal, learning much of eastern yoga and mysticism - he had essentially withdrawn into himself in order to extract his most profound music, a task which must have racked him and yet yielded a huge number of musical works, works which show not only a profound musical intuition but a deep concern for performance.  The fact that this music can be performed as written on a wide variety of instruments and in an idiomatic way is supreme testimony to his deep involvement, despite his lonely existence.  By this time Scelsi had restricted himself to linguistic expression only through French poetry - he had disavowed any analysis or explanation of himself or his music, indeed refusing much personal contact as well as photographs.  He had moved to an apartment in Rome, overlooking the ancient Roman Forum, and had established an environment in which his intuition was to blossom apart from the mainstream of music, and he had returned to a deeply religious nature incorporating elements from around the world.  Scelsi's use of eastern musical elements is never tacked on, and he does not engage in pure exoticism: he redefines the basis of music using these elements out of which spring a new logic which is both western and eastern at its core.  Here his music is more deeply eastern than Messiaen's use of Hindu modes of melody and harmony, or of Tournemire's quintessential modal development based in Catholic choral thinking.  Scelsi matches Tournemire in his subtle and philosophical use of extended modality as no one else has, and rises above Messiaen's juxtapositions to a more unified view of form - he does this by finding a certain innocence and power in sound itself, and redefining his material at its core.  In addition, Scelsi is not bound to the chromatic scale, and one is immediately reminded that middle-eastern modes make explicit use of quarter tones.  Scelsi is no longer a composer, but in his own words: a messenger.  Scelsi's Second Period begins with his return to composition with the piano music, moves through a variety of short as well as classically-sized compositions for solo instruments of all kinds, and ends in a return to ensemble thinking climaxing in the Quattro Pezzi per orchestra (1959).  By this time, the basic aspects of his mature style have been established: this style was to find its perfect expression in the music of his Third Period.  In the mid-50s, as well as concluding his piano output and writing his marvelous series of tonal Divertimenti for solo violin, Scelsi wrote many short pieces for wind instruments.  This music includes not only the influence of Hindu sound philosophy from India and the far east, but also of the near east: Greece, Egypt, Syria, Arabia, Byzantium.  Scelsi's titles become more obscure, and draw on Latin, Ancient Greek, Egyptian, Assyrian, Sanskrit, even Mayan and other words which have been impossible to identify.  There is a feeling for middle eastern modality in some of this wind music: Pwyll (1954) for flute evokes Greece, and Ixor (1956) for reeds evokes the ancient Egyptian ney.  The many short solo pieces for woodwinds and brass, can easily be viewed as studies for his later ensemble and orchestral music; in fact, many are titled simply as 'pieces' which lends itself well to this interpretation.  He returns also to music for voice with instrumental accompaniment in Yamaon (Yama is the Vedic ruler of the dead), a format which was to have increasing interest for him.  It was during the 50s that Scelsi built the foundation for his subsequent phenomenal music - music which eventually becomes totally transfigured by the early 70s.  In addition to the many shorter pieces with perhaps a more restricted purpose, Scelsi also began two of his greatest chamber masterpieces in the later 1950s.  The Trilogy for solo cello ranks as one of his most intimate works, the first two parts of which (Triphon, Dithome) were written in 1957 while the third (Ygghur) was completed in 1961 and only finally notated in 1965.  In addition, the phenomenal Elegia per Ty for viola and cello was conceived in 1958, only to be notated in 1966.  This disparity in dating some of Scelsi's music is undoubtedly due to the fact that it was worked out in improvisation and in fact recorded, only to be notated subsequently with the help of copyists.  The Trilogy is Scelsi's autobiography in sound to that point and it is also his first major attempt at developing his new polyphonic style.  This is a polyphony which emerges out of monody: Scelsi's movements have a unity of gesture about them even when not restricted to a single note (which is actually rarely the case) and the polyphony of his string writing is contained within a purely melodic conception which is articulated polyphonically not just as ornamentation, but as an essential aspect of the sound itself.  Scelsi's polyphonic style is undoubtedly drawn in part from the more open style of the early Renaissance: Ockeghem and Busnois; and one is reminded of Scelsi's early \"medieval education,\" his position as a classics scholar.  Beyond that, it draws from the Greek drama with its declamatory style and unison writing.  Scelsi's love of polyphony and counterpoint is already apparent from his early compositional work, such as the second movement of the first quartet - and his later polyphony continues to seek a compactness of expression, though largely abandoning counterpoint interpreted as such.  His writing for solo strings presents a variety of new instrumental techniques, not least of which is his use of new types of mutes: metallic and applied to individual strings, lending buzzing overtones as in the Indian sitar.  This string polyphony was to find its perfection in the mid-60s with his use of string by string notation, as in medieval tablature.  He also uses a variety of mutes for brass, illustrating his profound concern for timbre.  Scelsi's polyphony is both ancient and modern, and particularly in the works for solo strings presents the player with the difficult task of retaining a unity of utterance while performing the complex individual parts, and of course it is precisely on a stringed instrument that this program can best be carried out.  In 1958, Scelsi returned to choral writing with his Tre canti popolari for 4-voice choir and his Tre canti sacri for 8-voice choir.  It is precisely in these three sacred songs (Angelus, Requiem and Gloria) that one can find this polyphonic writing at its most intense and complex.  Each of these songs (and one might call them motets) is approximately five minutes in length, compact and uses tight formal structures.  One finds sustained notes, unison writing leading to shimmering and buzzing overtones, quick movements in some parts, slow glides between notes, sometimes convulsive verbal delivery, and above all a powerful and mystical utterance outside of the normal flow of time; the coda of the Gloria is especially effective in ending the set.  These are tough pieces to crack, slices of eternity, and anticipate the extremely complex choral style of Uaxuctum.  Another important work from the late-50s is Kya for clarinet and seven instruments (1959).  This is one of two concertante-style pieces in Scelsi's late output (the other being Anahit), and presents a rather relaxed and open atmosphere.  In addition to being a scrupulous study of timbre with particular reference to the solo clarinet, it presents the basic cadential motion which is to continue in force through the more complex orchestral works, Hurqualia and Aion.  Also in 1958, Scelsi wrote his String Trio.  This piece is a close companion to the following year's Four Pieces for Orchestra: it is also in four movements each based on a single note, and in fact the combination of movements in each of these two pieces serves to dissect the tritone.  In the String Trio, the instrumental forces are of course much smaller and the composition itself is slightly shorter - each of the two being approximately fifteen minutes in total length.  So, in some ways the trio is more adventurous than the set for chamber orchestra: not only is the sequence of pitches between movements complicated by transposition, but the third movement of the trio has two important pitches instead of one.  At any rate, there is an incredible tension about this piece which one cannot imagine from a description alone.  Scelsi's music has been compared with Ligeti's use of micropolyphony; however it has quite a different effect and emerges from a completely different source: there is no mechanical quality as one so often finds in Ligeti, there is no formula of any kind, only a simple prescription of boundaries in which the imagination of the composer is given free reign: an idea going back to Josquin and beyond.  The symphonic works Hurqualia (1960), Aion (1961) and Hymnos (1963) form something of an orchestral trilogy, and taken together make a super-symphony of about fifty minutes duration.  There is hardly a more intense listening experience than beginning with the dramatic Hurqualia, following with the absolute mysticism of Aion, and concluding with the extended harmony of Hymnos.  In addition to these three great works, the early 60s also saw Scelsi's return to the medium of the string quartet with another succession of astonishingly varied masterpieces: String Quartet No.  2 (1961), String Quartet No.  3 (1963) and String Quartet No.  4 (1964).  These three quartets are among Scelsi's greatest masterpieces - each makes important contributions to his oeuvre and the genre as a whole.  The mid-60s also saw the production of some of Scelsi's greatest chamber music for small forces.  The third part of the Trilogy for solo cello, Ygghur (catharsis in Sanskrit) was conceived in 1961, and finally notated string by string in 1965.  In addition, the duo for viola and cello, Elegia per Ty (which was the nickname of Scelsi's wife who had left in the 40s and who he was never to hear of again) which had been conceived in 1958 was notated string by string in 1966.  Ygghur forms the conclusion of one of Scelsi's most personal works, the Trilogia \"The Three Ages of Man, \" and the Elegy is equally personal - one of Scelsi's most powerful and most melancholy works.  The Elegy (in three movements) is arguably the greatest composition for the combination of viola and cello, and an extremely emotional and intense piece, though very difficult to approach and beginning in a state of utter anguish.  Perhaps with the final notation of this incredible work, Scelsi had come to terms with his own loneliness.  Scelsi's greatest composition for solo violin (and this from a composer who wrote some of history's best solo violin music) is Xnoybis (1964) which was entirely conceived at this time, and takes up the string by string writing of the contemporaneous fourth quartet as well as requiring scordatura.  Xnoybis is a work of great tension, demanding intense concentration from both the performer and the listener.  It is in three movements and evolves almost entirely within the smallest microtonal space - leading to a powerful vision of the interior of sound.  Xnoybis is one of Scelsi's most important and most difficult works, and a masterpiece of the violin literature.  As well as continuing his series of string quartets and pieces for smaller string ensembles, Scelsi also wrote five pieces for larger string ensembles during his Third Period.  Already he had written for string orchestra with the Introduction and Fugue (1945) of his First Period, and his first string orchestra work of the Third Period was also drawn from this time: in 1962, he produced a version of the Quartet No.  1 (1944) for string orchestra.  This was undoubtedly viewed as a study for the upcoming series of works elaborating the later quartets for large forces.  The only new work for full string orchestra is Chukrum - also written in 1963, a year when Scelsi was apparently rather busy.  This is followed by Anagamin (1965) for twelve strings, Ohoi (1966) for sixteen strings, and Natura Renovatur (1967) for eleven strings.  These three works for string ensembles are drawn in some degree from the second, third and fourth string quartets (it is unclear to me to what extent without hearing them), and it is worthwhile to mention Robin Freeman's remark that calling these works for string orchestra merely the quartets with a few instruments added is like calling Bach's 6-part ricercar merely a two-part invention with a few voices added.  At any rate, they do play some significant role in Scelsi's output, not least of which because he saw fit to give them abstract titles and even subtitles, but also because the tonal elaboration involved in increasing the number of instruments undoubtedly contributed to the more full sound of the late works of his Third Period.  It is suspected that the name Anagamin is pulled from near eastern mythology along with Xnoybis and Anahit (which certainly is), though this has not been established; the piece also has a very interesting sub-title: the one who is faced with a choice between turning back and refusing to.  Hence this work seems to mark some sort of definitive conclusion for Scelsi, in 1965 - the year after String Quartet No.  4 and Xnoybis.  Ohoi (which may simply be a variant of 'ahoy') is subtitled 'the creative principles, ' again indicating that the piece had some significance for Scelsi.  Finally, Natura Renovatur (Renovative Nature) is the re-working of fourth quartet - and it above all possesses such a tremendous potential for expansion and elaboration that one can imagine Scelsi renovating this work many times.  These three pieces for string ensembles are among Scelsi's most important unrecorded later works (along with the cryptic Tkrdg (1968) for accompanied choir) and are important for understanding his orchestral development from Hymnos to Konx-Om-Pax.  Throughout his Third Period, Scelsi wrote vocal music - this begins with unaccompanied songs already in 1960, and progresses to one of Scelsi's most important chamber works: Khoom (1962) for soprano voice, horn, string quartet and percussion.  The work is in seven movements, subtitled: \"Seven Episodes of an unwritten story of Love and Death in a distant land. \" Khoom is a powerful succession of narrative episodes, dominated by the vocalist who is accompanied by various combinations of instruments.  The text of the work is entirely of words made up by Scelsi, a technique he had already used in The Birth of the Verb (La Nascita del Verbo; 1948) and was to continue to use in most of his other vocal music.  Of course, he was not the first to do this - in fact, Khoom is rather similar to Messiaen's Harawi in general idea - but the semantic content which emerges from these syllables is eerily effective.  Khoom also marks the first important work in Scelsi's collaboration with the Japanese singer, Michiko Hirayama whose voice continued to be the model for much of Scelsi's future vocal output.  1962 is also the year in which the series of songs, Canti del Capricorno (written specifically for Hirayama's voice as an instrument), was begun; and there are several other vocal works, some with chamber accompaniment, which were written during the 60s.  Another series of works which belong to the Third Period are Scelsi's Rites (already pre-figured by I Presagi in 1958): there are three compositions with this title for different chamber forces and dedicated to different historical personages.  This series of rites reaches something of a climax with Okanagon (1968) for harp, tamtam and double bass (a piece which was recorded several years ago, but is now unavailable).  Finally, there is a continuance of choral writing with Yliam (1964) (the title may be a variant of Ilium - ancient Troy) and Tkrdg (1968) for six-voice choir, electric guitar and percussion.  In 1966, Scelsi wrote his most complex, dramatic and incredible work: the choral and orchestral masterpiece, Uaxuctum.  Konx-Om-Pax (1969) marks the ends of Scelsi's Third Period.  As well as summarizing his basic material to that date, it his last piece which uses extended movements and large forms.  The music of his Fourth Period was to become increasingly transfigured.  Scelsi's Fourth Period begins in 1970 with a return to the purely tonal idiom in Antifona for tenor solo and eight-voice male choir.  It is a strict antiphon, using only the name 'Jesu' built into simple and austere melodies, in which the tenor alternates with the choir usually in unison; it is also among the most relaxed.  At fourteen minutes, it is Scelsi's longest recorded single movement.  The Three Latin Prayers (Ave Maria, Pater Noster, Alleluia; 1970) are also written in austere tonality, this time for solo voice.  Here Scelsi is re-asserting his love for tonality, as well as returning to traditional Latin lyrics.  On the whole, the music of the early-70s is marked by extremely short pieces, completely transfigured, and almost crystalline in their perfection; Scelsi had moved past the consolidation of his Third Period into a time when he was to give expression to his musical intuition in its purest form.  Most of these compositions come in pairs: two pieces for solo violin, two for solo cello, two for solo double bass; as well as a return to writing for string duos: two violins, cello and double bass, two double basses.  This series of music for double bass also marks Scelsi's association with Fernando Grillo.  The duo for two violins, Arc-en-ciel (Rainbow; 1973), is one of his finest mystic revelations.  It is in one movement, lasting under five minutes, yet gives witness to a profound vision of time and sound.  Arc-en-ciel consists almost entirely of microtonal glissandi in the highest register, extending beyond and within itself.  The vocal works of this period also come in pairs, along with Pranam I (1972) and Pranam II (1973) - the first for voice and chamber orchestra, the second for a chamber orchestra of nine musicians.  Pranam is an Indian gesture of greeting, and Pranam II is Scelsi's retrospective look at his previous achievements: it contains the performance note: \"Though the tempo and other directions must be followed, a certain amount of flexibility of phrasing is required in order to create an impression of breathing (inhalation, exhalation, suspended respiration and so on) or the image of a wave on the sea. \" This same note could apply to much of Scelsi's Fourth Period music, and Pranam II (in one movement, lasting under seven minutes) is a particularly fine example of his flowing and eternal style.  The last period also marks Scelsi's return to keyboard writing with In Nomine Lucis (1974) for organ and Aitsi (1974) for prepared piano.  In Nomine Lucis (In the Name of Light) consists of two works for organ (though mysteriously titled as I & V, indicating that three intervening ones may yet turn up), one written for chromatic electric organ and the other for quarter-tone electric organ.  Each presents a re-working of the basic theme of Konx-Om-Pax (1969), though compressed into a single movement of approximately five minutes.  As the title suggests, In Nomine Lucis is one of Scelsi's most luminous works, building into a massive complex of sound and then ebbing away - the second, with its quarter-tone writing, is an especially powerful invocation.  Aitsi (whose title probably comes from the Greek stem meaning 'cause') is Scelsi's return to the piano after almost twenty years of abandonment.  In this case, its sound is de-tempered and manipulated by electronics.  This one movement work of approximately six movements is built out of stacked chords whose constituent elements are subjected to varying resonant decays: it is perhaps Scelsi's most complex and daring vision of sound.  Aitsi also forms the basis for the String Quartet No.  5 (1985) which was precipitated by the death of Scelsi's close friend, the French poet Henri Micheaux.  In 1974, Scelsi wrote his final piece for large orchestra: Pfhat.  Whether this highly polished work continues to be effective is debatable, but at times it has really worked for me.  Hence it is with an attempt to guide the listener that Scelsi ends his orchestral output - his creative energy was to ebb away in the face of his increasing age during the mid-70s (though he did spend time working with performers, leading to the performance of much of the chamber music), finally exhausting itself in the re-scoring of Aitsi as String Quartet No.  5 in 1985, and then finding fulfillment in the orchestral premieres of the late-80s.  Finally, Scelsi's last original work is Maknongan (1976, at which point he was over seventy years old, and had produced more than one hundred works of incredible variety and startling originality) for either bass tuba, contra-bassoon, bass saxophone, bass flute or double string bass; it has been recorded on both contra-bassoon and double bass.  The title has some meaning for me (though I have been unable to exactly place the term; possibly implying a Celtic origin), and the extremely short piece (under four minutes) is his most compact, abstract (particularly given the variety of instruments allowed in the score), and monodic mystical epic in sound.

", "article_3": "Giacinto Scelsi's music was largely unknown throughout most of his life, as he refused to conduct interviews or make analytical comments about his works and rarely sought out performances.  The attitudes behind his musical creations can be tied in with this reclusiveness; from the 1940s he saw music as a type of spiritual revelation.  He began to compose his better known pieces at this time, works which involved static harmony with surface fluctuations of timbre and microtonal inflection.  This type of harmonic minimalism was developed independently of other minimalist trends of the twentieth century, and was received with fascination by the musical world when his music finally began to receive performances and recordings in the 1980s.  He wrote over 100 works, including several major pieces for orchestra, and works for chamber ensemble, string quartets, and solo and duo pieces.  Many of his pieces were worked out in improvisation and subsequently written down.  Scelsi was born into a wealthy, aristocratic Italian family, a circumstance which allowed him to compose without the necessity of making a living.  He played the piano from an early age, before studying composition when in his thirties with Walter Klein, a pupil of Schoenberg's, and then with the Scriabin enthusiast Egon Koehler.  Scelsi absorbed the influences of his teachers in this period, using Schoenberg's techniques to write 12-tone music, but also writing in a freely atonal style.  Many of the works from this time are for the piano.  He traveled widely between the world wars, notably to Africa and Asia.  Around the time of the Second World War, Scelsi suffered a breakdown and was forced to spend time convalescing.  His thinking began to be shaped by the eastern philosophies that he had picked up while traveling.  He came to the point of view that composition was a spiritual process which had nothing to do with the individualism that had been part of most music making in Europe since the eighteenth century.  Rather, he saw the composer as the creator of circumstances through which the secrets in sounds could be revealed.  At this time he also became fascinated by the complex of sounds which could be produced by a single note, and reportedly played single pitches repeatedly on the piano, listening intently.  These influences began to be felt in his works in the 1950s, with many pieces consisting of very slowly shifting harmony, often moving in one direction, for example in String Quartet No.  4 (1964).  This trend was at its most pronounced in the Quattro Pezzi Su Una Nota Sola (Four pieces each on a single note) (1959), for chamber orchestra, where refined orchestration, glissandi, trills, and microtonal movement are given prominence through the stillness of larger scale harmonic action.  Other notable works from this period are Khoom (1962) for soprano and small ensemble and Anahit (1965) for violin and 18 instrumentalists.  Khoom was part of Scelsi's early 1960s interest in the possibilities of the human voice, developed through his collaborations with the singer Michiko Hirayama.  From the 1970s Scelsi's pieces became generally shorter and more succinct.  Dating Scelsi's compositions has been difficult as he re-dated manuscripts deliberately to confuse musicologists.  He would not have his photograph taken, and preferred instead to be represented by the symbol of a horizontal line placed under a circle. ", "article_4": "\"The Messenger\" by Alex Ross The New Yorker, Nov.  21, 2005.  In the beginning was the Tone.  Throughout musical history, composers have commenced major works with a primordial hum, as if to suggest that the universe was audible before it became visible.  Monteverdis \"Orfeo,\" the first masterpiece of opera, begins with an open fifth, notes like twin pillars, over which a high trumpet plays skirling fanfares.  Haydns \"Creation\" begins with monumental octave Cs, which have the weight of the word of God.  Beethovens Ninth Symphony starts softly, almost imperceptibly, with A and E gleaming in the horns and shimmering in the strings: we tune in to an eternity-in-progress.  Wagners four-day \"Ring\" cycle is set in motion by a similar cosmogenic drone: an E-flat rumbles deep in the \"mystic abyss,\" as the orchestra pit in Bayreuth is called, and wave upon wave of consonant harmony emanates from it.  As the nineteenth century gave way to the twentieth, majestic natural visions fell out of fashion.  Strausss \"Thus Spake Zarathustra,\" in imitation of the \"Ring,\" begins with mighty triads over a fundamental, but in the next section a thick harmonic fog descends and the glory is never seen again.  In early, radical works by Ravel, Stravinsky, and Schoenberg, repeated tones are alarms of obsession, signals of frenzy.  By the time of Alban Bergs \"Wozzeck,\" which was initially sketched during the First World War, the single note had become an instrument of terror: toward the climax of the opera, two enormous Bs are drilled into the listeners brain.  In the tragic symphonic narratives of Shostakovichs Fourth and Vaughan Williamss Sixth, monotone patterns seem to represent the world dying with a whimper: entropy in action.  At the end of the nineteen-fifties, Giacinto Scelsi, a self-taught Italian composer and erstwhile playboy count who had dabbled in Eastern religions and Theosophy, had the extraordinary idea of writing an entire work--the \"Four Pieces\" for chamber orchestra--that consisted of only single tones, one for each movement.  Scelsi was not the first to hit on this concept: Elliott Carter had ventured it in his \"Eight Etudes and a Fantasy,\" in 1950.  Nor is the scheme followed literally: the instruments often bend away from the parent note, shifting by microtones, semitones, or larger intervals.  But, by the end of the work, a paradigm shift has taken place: the Tone is all-powerful once more.  Music returns to its primitive origins, when melody formed from noise.  In each of Scelsis subsequent works, the phenomenon is repeated.  Small wonder that this obscure Roman eccentric, who considered himself a \"messenger\" or \"medium,\" has become a cult figure among younger composers: he makes the eternal new.  Scelsi would have been a hundred this year.  Given his mystical propensities, it might be better to say that he is a hundred, although he was observed to have died in 1988.  To mark the occasion, Miller Theatre, at Columbia University, invited the Flux Quartet to play Scelsis five string quartets earlier this month.  Live performances of this composers works remain rare; Michael Tilson Thomas, in San Francisco, is the only American conductor who programs them.  It is far easier to get to know the music on recordings, by way of the Accord, CPO, Kairos, and Mode labels.  Many of the disks are decorated with the Zen-like symbol that the composer made his signature: a circle above a line, like a note floating free of its staff.  Scelsi was born into an old southern Italian noble family, inheriting the title Count dAyala Valva from his mother.  He was, of course, the end of the line.  At the family castle, he was schooled in \"fencing, chess, and Latin,\" or so he said.  He flitted through European aristocratic circles and had his wedding party at Buckingham Palace.  But music was his chief obsession.  He quickly tilted toward the avant-garde, and when he was very young he attended Luigi Russolos Futurist noise concerts; his first major work was called \"Printing Presses. \" Later, he became interested in Schoenbergs twelve-tone method, although he did not adopt it.  He fell in love with Eastern philosophy and made trips to India and Nepal.  After the Second World War, he suffered a breakdown and stopped composing for a few years.  He spent day after day playing a single note on the piano.  The casual observer might have thought that he had gone mad.  He was, in fact, finding his path.  The chanting of Tibetan monks generally consists of deviations around a central tone, with bells and brass creating an ambient halo.  Scelsi enacted similar rituals on the piano, then moved to the ondiola, an electronic keyboard whose dials allowed him to vary pitch and tone quality.  He wasnt sure how to write it all down, and employed a fellow-composer, Vieri Tosatti, to devise suitable notation.  After Scelsis death, Tosatti published an article with the incendiary title \"Giacinto Scelsi CEst Moi,\" asserting not only that he was the true author of the music but that it was all rubbish.  Controversy ensued, and some high-minded European types dismissed Scelsi as a fraud.  Robin Freeman, in an essay in the magazine Tempo, suggested the opposite: that Scelsi was able to make his imaginative leaps precisely because he was not bound by academic training.  Its something for university composition departments to ponder.  Scelsis methods were strange, but he had a command of narrative which no ghostwriter could have provided.  Otherwise, we would be talking about the genius of Tosatti.  The music is anything but monotonous; it seethes with change.  In the quartets, the players use every trick in the book to transform those long tones, varying the degree of vibrato, bowing over the fingerboard or close to the bridge, adding steel mutes, scraping with maximum pressure.  As the tones shift, split apart, and fan out, surprising shapes emerge.  In the last part of the Fourth Quartet, a cluster of pitches creeps ever upward, and, in the process, major and minor triads materialize out of nowhere.  (The spellbinding \"Rain Over the Sangre de Cristo Mountains\" sequence, in John Adamss \"Doctor Atomic,\" uses a similar process. ) Orchestral works such as the \"Four Pieces,\" \"Aion,\" and \"Anahit\" build to crypto-Romantic climaxes worthy of Bruckner: horns leap up an octave, winds trill on high, timpani bang out thirds, and the heavens open.  In \"Konx-Om-Pax,\" which Mode has recorded, a chorus is added to the mix, chanting an apocalyptic \"Om. \" Connoisseurs of extreme chamber music may remember that in 1999 the Flux Quartet gave the world premiere of the complete version of Morton Feldmans six-hour-long Second Quartet.  Scelsis quartets, relatively brief in span, dont pose the same challenge of endurance, but they are taxing nevertheless, taking a toll on the bowing arm and on the emotions.  Every note counts, each new one more than the last.  During the performance at Miller Theatre, I sometimes wished for greater tonal purity, especially in the Fourth Quartet: the chords were hard to hear amid the haze of special effects.  But I doubt that any other ensemble could have played with equal ferocity and passion.  Scelsi demands imaginative collaborators, and the members of Flux -- Tom Chiu and Conrad Harris, violinists; Max Mandel, violist; and Dave Eggar, cellist-- did nothing by rote.  What most struck me, in my first live encounter with this music, was that the cycle becomes one towering superquartet, in arch form.  The First Quartet is the rough foundation: it is couched in a largely atonal idiom, midway between Berg and Bartok.  In its final movement, the First suddenly takes off into a world of eerie purity, drawing principally on the \"white notes\" of the C-major scale.  In the Second Quartet, the \"one-note\" method arrives, to harsh, assaultive effect.  But sonorous thirds appear in the last movement, marking Scelsis reassertion of consonance.  The Third brings some rich, glowing major triads, ghosts of the Romantic century.  The Fourth Quartet, with its searing chorale, is the zenith.  The Fifth Quartet plunges back down to the world of the single note.  It is F, the same on which the revolutionary \"Four Pieces\" began, and it comes and goes in gasping breaths, interspersed with silences.  The Fifth, transcribed in 1984, was Scelsis last work--at least that we know of.  Scientific researchers have recently observed a musical event that employs a curiously familiar style: a black hole in the Perseus cluster of galaxies is emitting a B-flat fifty-seven octaves below middle C. ", "article_5": "Real Name: Conte Giacinto Francesco Maria Scelsi dAyala Valva Profile: Born 8th January 1905 in La Spezia, died 9th August 1988 in Rome, Scelsi was an Italian composer who also wrote surrealist poetry in French.  He is best known for writing music based around only one pitch, altered in all manners through microtonal oscillations, harmonic allusions, and changes in timbre and dynamics, but has gone through four different creative periods.  His musical output remained largely undiscovered even within contemporary musical circles during most of his life, until a series of concerts in the mid to late 1980s finally premiered many of his pieces to great acclaim.  He has then been noted as a visionary of many avantgarde ideas that only later became known through the works of other composers.

Resting at the outer reaches of avant-garde chamber and electronic music - moving at a glacial pace of tightly wound energy - Pranams two sides radically rethink the terms electroacoustic music in ways that still feel radically ahead of their time, more than 15 years after they were first laid to tape.  A modular chamber ensemble with a pointedly anti-academic approach to music, over the course of its activities - running roughly between 1990 and 2010 - Alter Ego developed a devoted following among some of the most forward thinking voices in experimental music, all the while collaborating widely with artists spanning a vast range of practices and disciplines, including Robin Rimbaud, Philip Jeck, Pan Sonic, Matmos, Gavin Bryars, Andrew Hooker, William Basinski, David Moss, Alvin Curran, Terry Riley, and near countless number of others.  Alter Egos diverse activities can be understood as interventions with the disposition toward formality within contemporary chamber music, often pairing themselves with artists working well beyond their own context as a means to develop highly original interpretations of a specific composers work.  In 2005, this process led them to invite Matmos, the American duo of Drew Daniel, Martin Schmidt - acclaimed for a body of visionary albums at the vanguard of electronic process and sampling - to collaborate on a series of interpretations of works by the legendary Italian composer Giacinto Scelsi.  Realized in collaboration with The Fondazione Isabella Scelsi, which holds Giacinto Scelsis archives, and performed at the Festival Roma Europa and the Festival Aeterforum during May of 2005, the albums four works - Estratti dal Quartetto per archi n. 3 (1963), Ko-Lho (1966), Riti: I Funerali di Carlo Magno A. D.  814 (1976), Aitsi (1974) - shift the boundaries of 20th Century chamber music toward markedly new and contemporary terms, incorporating everything from the sounds of the Revox tape machine that Scelsi used to record his own improvisations and processed electronics, to the plastic trumpets used by fans during football matches.  From intertwining, shifting lone-tones that render startling resonances and dissonances, to passages guided by a vast pallet of electronics and flurries of acoustic sounds, joined as a single ensemble, across the two sides of Pranam, Alter Ego and Matmos infuse these four works by Scelsi with humor and playfulness, while retaining all the urgency and rigour with which they were initially composed.  Delicate and meditative, while tightly wound and brooding, Pranam brings the works of Giacinto Scelsi to life in ways that almost no group ever has.  Riveting and immersive from start to finish, Die Schachtel is thrilled to present these never before heard recordings from the archives of Alter Ego.

Hence he is often called the Charles Ives of Italy.  While it took music publishers nearly 50 years to take on and promulgate his works, three collections of his poetry were published in French in Paris in 1949, 1954 and 1962.  Scelsi was mainly a self-taught composer, but received some instruction from Giacinto Sallustio in Rome and Egon Koehler in Geneva who acquainted him with Scriabins work.  He also studied with Walter Klein, a music theorist and friend of the Schoenberg circle who introduced him in 1936 to the music and theory of the \"Second Viennese School. \" Shortly thereafter Scelsi, made extended visits to Asia and became interested in Eastern philosophy, theosophy, yoga, and Buddhism, all of which affected his compositional approach as did his musical studies in Geneva and Vienna.  Eventually settling in Rome, Scelsi once remarked: \"Rome is the boundary between East and West.  South of Rome, the East starts, north of Rome, the West starts.  The borderline runs exactly through the Roman Forum.  There is my house: This explains my life and my music. \" Thus it is not surprising that Scelsis artistic ideas and compositional procedures, thwarted Western concepts of composition, improvisation, interpretation, and performance.  He did not consider himself a composer, but rather a medium or vessel who transcendentally received musical messages while meditating and improvising at the piano or on the guitar and percussion instruments.  Such \"intuitive\" or \"real time\" compositions were taped and transcribed and edited by others since the 1940s.  (After Scelsis death, some of his assistants, whom Scelsi had merely viewed as interpreters of his sonic messages, publicly and provocatively claimed to be his ghostwriters. ) The resulting scores, however, did not allow for flexibility or improvisation.  Like Scelsi and his assistants, the performer assumes the role of a medium, who merely conveys the sounds to the audience.  For Scelsi sound was cosmic energy and three-dimensional: \"The sound is round like a sphere, yet when one hears it, it seems to have only two dimensions: register and duration-of the third [dimension] we know that it exists, but it escapes us in some way.  The high and low overtones sometimes give the impression of a more comprehensive, manifold sound beyond duration and register, but it is difficult to comprehend its complexity. \" Searching for the \"third dimension\" or \"depth\" of sound, Scelsi attempted to expand the tonal realm and focused more and more on one or two single pitches.  These were treated like focal points and were reiterated or embroidered while subjected to very subtle modifications in intensity, timbre, dynamics and pitch.  This approach, however, led Scelsi to embrace microtonality and write music primarily for winds, strings and voice from the mid-1950s on.  Such works as Tre pezzi (1956) for trombone, Quattro pezzi su una nota sola (1959) for chamber orchestra or his last three String Quartets (1963-85) are based on single notes and their iridescent microtonal nuances.  Herewith Scelsi incidentally anticipated compositional techniques developed further by La Monte Young and Phill Niblock.  How do Scelsis works for solo piano and piano chamber works fit into his ouvre? Most of his numerous piano compositions, among them forty Preludes, eleven Suites, four Sonatas, Quattro illustrazioni, Cinque incantesimi, and Action Music, were written in two batches, from 1930 to 1943 and from 1952 to 1956 (if one wants to trust the dates of composition given by Scelsi, who intended to fool musicologists).  In 1974 Scelsi employed the piano for the last time when he created Aitsi for amplified piano and To the Master (two improvisations in collaboration with Victoria Parr) for cello and piano.  Assuming a special position within Scelsis compositional output, his works for piano shed not only light on his outstanding pianistic talent and his abilities as an improviser, but they indicate major changes in his compositional development.  Twelve-tone procedures in his early piano works reveal the influence of Schoenberg, Berg and Webern.  His Quattro Poemi (1936-39), for instance, of which the last piece is dedicated to Alban Berg, feature quotations from Bergs Piano Sonata, op.  1, fourth chords and suggestions to dodecaphony.  In following works such as the Second Sonata (on mode 92) and the Sixth Suite, Scelsi concentrated more and more on the exploration of pitch centers and clusters as focal points and on the autonomy of single tones or sounds.  When after more then a decade-long psychic crisis, Scelsi resumed composing for the piano, he fell back upon techniques he had used in his early works, namely motivic organization contrasted by somewhat amorphous pitch or sound centers.  Yet, more and more of these pieces focus on the repetition of single pitches.  They also reveal meditative aspects which are emphasized by such Sanskrit-derived subtitles as Bot-ba - An evocation of Tibet with its monasteries in the high mountains: Tibetan rituals, prayers and dances, (Suite No.  8, 1952), Ttai (Suite No.  9), or Ka (Suite No.  10).  In his search of the \"depth\" of sound and its microtonal qualities, the piano with its half-tone step limitation could no longer correspond to his artistic ideas; and as a consequence he stopped composing for this instrument in 1956.  However, Scelsi did not discard the piano, which had served as one of his imperative composing aids since the mid-forties.  Instead, he employed the \"ondiolina,\" an electric keyboard instrument which made possible quarter-tone differentiation.  Aitsi, Scelsis last work for amplified piano solo of 1974, in which the sustained pitches are distorted, incidentally originated due to a malfunction of his tape recorder.  It was ultimately arranged for string quartet in 1985.  --Sabine Feisst (from the notes to mode 92) Related Resources Giacinto Scelsi: Cinque Incantessimi for piano - Haydee Schvartz, piano + works of Berio, Cage, Gandhini, Kagel, Part and R.

He was fluent in German, Romanian, Italian, Polish, Ukrainian, Yiddish, French, and English; during his life, von Rezzori was successively a citizen of Austria-Hungary, Romania, and the Soviet Union, before becoming a stateless person and spending his final years as a citizen of Austria.  He married Beatrice Monti della Corte. Gregor von Rezzori was born in Czernowitz, Bukovina, part of Austria-Hungary at the time (1914).  He originated from an Italian aristocratic family from the Province of Ragusa who had settled in Vienna by the mid-18th century.  His father was an Austrian civil servant based in Czernowitz.  The family remained in the region after it became part of the Romanian Kingdom in 1919, and the young Gregor von Rezzori became a Romanian citizen.  After World War I von Rezzori studied in colleges in Brasov, Furstenfeld and Vienna.  He began studying mining at the University of Leoben, then architecture and medicine at the University of Vienna, where he eventually graduated in arts.  In mid-1930 he moved to Bucharest, took up military service in the Romanian Army, and made a living as an artist.  In 1938 he moved to Berlin, where he became active as a novelist, journalist, writer in radio broadcasting, and film production.  Given his Romanian citizenship, von Rezzori was not drafted into the Wehrmacht during World War II.  Until the mid-1950s, he worked as an author at the broadcasting company Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk.  He regularly published novels and stories, as well as working in film production as a screenplay author and actor (starring alongside actors such as Brigitte Bardot, Jeanne Moreau, Anna Karina, Marcello Mastroianni or Charles Aznavour).  Beginning in the early 1960s, Rezzori lived between Rome and Paris, with sojourns in the United States, eventually settling in Tuscany.  Besides writing and performing, he and his spouse Beatrice Monti della Corte were significant art collectors, and together founded the Santa Maddalena Retreat for Writers.  He died in Santa Maddalena, part of Florence's Donnini frazione. Rezzori began his career as a writer of light novels, but he first encountered success in 1953 with the Maghrebinian Tales, a suite of droll stories and anecdotes from an imaginary land called \"Maghrebinia\", which reunited in a grotesque and parodic key traits of his multicultural Bukovinian birthplace, of extinct Austria-Hungary and of Bucharest of his youth.  Over the years, Rezzori published further Maghrebinian Tales, which increased his reputation of language virtuosity and free spirit, writing with wit, insight and elegance. Other books, such as The Death of My Brother Abel, Oedipus at Stalingrad, or The Snows of Yesteryear, recording the fading world at the time of the World Wars, have been celebrated for their powerful descriptive prose, nuance and style. Rezzori first came to the attention of English-speaking readers with the 1969 publication of the story \"Memoirs of an Anti-Semite\" in The New Yorker, On this occasion, Elie Wiesel, who was born in Bukovina's neighboring Maramures, wrote: \"Rezzori addresses the major problems of our time, and his voice echoes with the disturbing and wonderful magic of a true storyteller. \" The novel-length version of Memoirs of an Anti-Semite was published in Germany in 1979, with the English translation following in 1981.  It received enthusiastic reviews from Christopher Lehmann-Haupt and Stanley Kaufmann when originally published.  It was reissued by New York Review Books in 2007, and Christopher Hitchens wrote in a retrospective review, \"Gregor von Rezzori could claim the peculiar distinction of being one of the few survivors to treat this ultimate catastrophe in the mild language of understatement.  This is what still gives his novel the power to shock. \" Reissues of The Snows of Yesteryear and An Ermine in Czernopol followed in 2008 and 2012, respectively.  In 2019 NYRB published The Death of My Brother Abel and its sequel Cain as a single volume. Elie Wiesel wrote of The Death of My Brother Abel, \"If a great novel can be recognized by its obsessions, its characters and, above all, its tone, then The Death of My Brother Abel is unquestionably great.  Rezzori addresses the major problems of our time, and his voice echoes with the disturbing and wonderful magic of the true storyteller. \" Rezzori's controversial description of Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita as \"the only convincing love story of our century\" appeared on the cover of the second Vintage International edition of the novel. It was attributed simply to \"Vanity Fair\", the magazine which published Rezzori's original review of the book, and Rezzori was not often heralded as the man behind the quote.  In his Guide for Idiots through German Society, von Rezzori also used his noted taste for satire.  Although he was not unanimously perceived as a major author in the German-speaking area, his posthumous reception has arguably confirmed him among the most important modern German-language authors.

References ", "article_1": "His left eyebrow quizzically raised, casually holding a cigarette between his fingers, Gregor von Rezzori peers from the 1959 New Year's edition of Spiegel news magazine, a writer at the height of his fame.  His Tales of Maghrebinia had been on the bestseller lists for years by then.  Critics were celebrating his most recent novel, An Ermine in Czernopol.  Maghrebinia was Rezzori's literary name for the multi-ethnic universe at the eastern outpost of the Habsburg Empire, where Romanians, Austrians, Germans, Ukrainians, Hungarians and Jews communicated in eight languages.  Czernopol stood for his birthplace Chernivtsi, the urban center of this legendary world wiped out by war, escape, mass murder, destruction and Gleichschaltung, or enforced political conformity.  Whatever was left after 1945 was absorbed into the domain of the Soviet Union.  Gregor von Rezzori on the Spiegel cover in January 1959 Forgotten in Germany, recognized in the US When Gregor von Rezzori died four decades later, buried under a small stone pyramid with the inscription \"Czernopol,\" his passing was not worth more than a short obituary in Spiegel, including the remark that the\"grand seigneur\" had felt neglected by literary critics.  Suddenly, the writer had become an almost forgotten \"confabulator,\" his work a collection of \"funny tales. \" Just as the actress Romy Schneider couldn't escape being identified with her signature movie role of \"Sissi,\" Rezzori was defined by his \"Maghrebian\" anecdotes.  It's either entertainment, or art -- the Germans' typical narrow point of view.  Instead, a 1981 English translation in the US of Rezzori's novel Memoirs of an Anti-Semite, a collection of five fictional biographical stories that take place between Bucharest, Vienna, Chernivtsi and Berlin, brought the versatile writer the appreciation he deserved.  The author had detailed knowledge of the basic social patterns of the years between the world wars, ranging from latent anti-Semitism to open hatred of Jews.  'Memoirs of an Anti-Semite' by Gregor von Rezzori Envy, fear, prejudice Sarcastically and elaborately, he exposed malevolence not among great villains as much as in the everyday, envious and fear-driven dullness of the Central European bourgeoisie.  As part of this class, the first-person narrator repeatedly finds himself caught up in fierce conflicts.  \"(. . . ) Jews were simply people of another star -- the star of David and Zion.  It might be a shining star, but for us, unfortunately, it shone under the horizon.  Therefore, falling in love with a Jewish girl could not be considered a pardonable perversion, like, for instance, that of a sodomite.  It was the incomprehensible, a sudden gap in one's mind, worse than treason and breach of troth.  I had good reason to be ashamed. \" The Jewish ghetto in Czernivtsi This passage is from Troth, the novel Gregor von Rezzori wrote in English in 1969 and that was well-received when published in the renowned magazine The New Yorker.  In Germany, people didn't accept this difficult subject from an author found to be on the light-hearted side.  However, literary scholar and polymath George Steiner considers Memoirs of an Anti-Semite to be one of the few books of German post-war literature that remains current.  That is another reason why it is on our list.  Gregor von Rezzori: Memoirs of an Anti-Semite, Penguin Random House, (German title: Denkwurdigkeiten eines Antisemiten, 1979).  English translation: Joachim Neugroschel and Gregor von Rezzori.  Born 1914 in Chernivtsi in the Austro-Hungarian region of Bukovina, as a German-language author with Sicilian ancestors Gregor von Rezzori was a multilingual European cosmopolitan.  Post-war literary Germany celebrated Rezzori primarily for his Tales of Maghrebinia, in which the author revived the lost world of Central Europe.  Rezzori died in Italy in 1998. ", "article_2": "Gregor von Rezzori, whose novels and memoirs revealed the tragic sweep of European history through two world wars and beyond, died last Thursday at his home in Donnini, a village near Florence.  He was 83 and also had homes in Manhattan and on the island of Rhodes.  The cause was a heart attack, said Elizabeth Sifton, his editor at Farrar, Straus & Giroux.  Mr.  von Rezzori wrote most of his work in German, though he also produced highly admired prose in English and Italian.  In whatever language, he evoked the collapsed polyglot world of the Austro-Hungarian Empire into which he was born.  He once described himself as ''a living anachronism,'' and ''a man dreaming of a lost homeland. '' That homeland, as it emerges from his provocatively titled novel ''Memoirs of an Anti-Semite'' (published in 1981 in the United States) or from his less fictionalized autobiographical work ''The Snows of Yesteryear'' (1989) was rooted geographically, culturally and emotionally in Bukovina, a region in central Europe that at the time of Mr.  von Rezzori's birth on May 13, 1914, was an outpost of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.  The empire collapsed with the outbreak of World War I a few months later, and Bukovina would experience the convulsions of history that would remake the face of Europe.  Mr.  von Rezzori would watch his homeland fall under the rule of Romania and the Soviet Union; today it is divided between Ukraine and Romania.  But it was Bukovina as it was ruled from Vienna that served as the point of departure for Mr.  von Rezzori's life and work.  His hometown of Czernowitz (now Chernovtsy in Ukraine) had a rich but complicated national and ethnic history, and much of his work depicts the loss of a familiar, if never idealized, order and the onset of chaos. ", "article_3": "\"But everything is over.  If I were really a writer, I would have to be able to prevent the war\" - Anonymous, quoted in Elias Canetti, The Writers Profession, 1976.  Abel and Cain is Rezzoris most ambitious novel, clocking it at some 860 pages, mixing reflections, film scripts, poems, and letters into the main body of a paranoid and repetitive text.  The books style, ambition and playful attitude brings up questions about the function of the novel, and the slipperiness of reality.  There are questions about why Abel and Cain strikes such a postmodernist style when Rezzori is so often resolutely modernist.  And of course, there are questions about who the narrator even is, or if we can solve such a mystery.  Abel and Cain invokes these questions from within the setting of post-WWII Europe.  The novels slipperiness is its point, its message.  It is an attempt to come to terms with what remains, or indeed doesnt remain, after the ravages of fascism.  # Abel and Cain opens with a false start, recounting a short tale of a prostitute who, despite her best intentions, falls for a client.  The story (as well as the novel)opens with the lines \"I ran after him. \" The story - but not the novel - closes with \"I really hurried.  But he was already gone. \" These two lines bracket the false start of the novel yet also encapsulate its overriding theme.  For as the narrator will tell us again and again, he is incomplete.  When the novel, or its first section, starts proper the reader is greeted with this opener: \"As if he had been cast away among the lotus eaters, he seemed to have forgotten his fatherland. \" Yet this sense of loss is not some general and vague ennui, it has a specific cause and root, one that structures the reflections in the book.  Barely twenty pages in, the narrator tells us: \"I am seeking a lost part of myself, the other half of what was originally a pair.  I lost it at some point or other - I suspect on an icy-clear day in Vienna, March 1938. \" The event alluded to here is of no less historical significance than Anschluss.  By centring Anschluss in the narrators decentring, Rezzori turns Abel and Cain into both a prequel and a sequel to his better known work Memoirs of an Anti-Semite.  The fundamental brilliance of Memoirs was to paint a picture of living under the rise of anti-Semitism and fascism whilst being unaffected and complicit.  To recount the experience of fascisms rise as neither Nazi nor victim.  Rezzori uses this perspective to great effect.  In Memoirs he paints a picture of walking into the darkness of World War II, almost literally.  In the chapter 'Troth, Rezzoris narrator recounts the march in favour of Anschluss.  Unaware of what is going on, he literal joins ranks with Nazis out of ignorance: \"I tried to break through between the blocks, but I did not succeed.  Two or three times I asked a bystander what was going on, and got no answer.  Impatient, fearing I would be late for the appointment with my beloved, I squeezed myself into the last row of a marching block and marched with them.  'What the hell are we marching for? I asked the man beside me.  'Anschluss, he barked.  Well that literally meant \"connection\" and that was exactly what I was looking for. \" In Abel and Cain the narrator describes the same event.  Yet he has the benefit of hindsight, and the knowledge gained from this hindsight is devastating.  Compare the above passage with the description of the Anschluss march in Abel: \"The coagulated flood of iron men smashed the groves of on the Rausthausplatz and soiled the monument to Riter Von Sonnethal, presumably because. . [they]. . smelled a Jew in the name. \" Heading the marchers are the employees of the Municipal Street Car company and behind them they \"pulled the monstrous thing along behind them: a worm as black as nightshade, crawling along on thousands of legs, aglint with the will-o-the-wisps of thousands of eyes in which the pale fire of the hour of decision was glowing. \" Ignorance truly is bliss.  What is the significance of this event for the two narrators, for Rezzori himself? Anschluss is the moment that Rezzori or his narrators-or both,originally citizens of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, become implicated in the horrors of WWII.  Wrestling with this, with the guilt of even mild complicity, becomes the theme of Abel and Cain.  In this way Memoirs and Abel and Cain form a unified project: one of man before the fall (Memoirs), the other of man after the fall (Abel and Cain).  One of the reasons the narrator is so hard to pin down, so slippery and imprecise, is because he is fractured.  This fracturing stems from his awareness of his own complicity in the end of the world.  This guilt shatters the narrator, he becomes uncertain and divided.  The narrator, reflecting on the difference between him now and as young man - i. e as a man before Anschluss - writes: \"ME, my SELF - and neither concerned me directly.  Each was I, My SELF - but simply as history: as my abstraction. \" This fracturing comes to define the narrator.  Held back from proper engagement with the world and himself by an immense guilt the narrator has reckless and unfulfilling love affairs, sometimes with women half his age.  He becomes estranged from his son.  He describes himself as an airport, a generic and clinical place; a non-place to use Marc Auges term.  He dreams of murdering a maid and burying her, and this dream is so powerful he feels he has actually done this in a forgotten past.  And finally, he has betrayed, possibly murdered, his closest and dearest friend, his 'brother.  The novel itself is testament to this fractured character.  He is incapable of finishing things.  Rezzoris narrator has spent 19 years writing this very book, and it is not even complete.  The first 240 pages take the form of a letter to a Joseph Brodnsky, a publisher whom he has stood up, explaining why he cannot explain his novel in three sentences.  Later the narrator will produce a novel in three sentences, but it is not this novel.  His fractured soul produces a fractured novel: thumb through its pages and one will find poems, long-winded recollections, and many italicized passages.  Perspectives will shift, locations will suddenly change, disorientating surrealism turns into haunting realism and the past becomes the future.  This is all ridiculous enough.  Yet it is also serious enough.  For behind this madness is a crucial question: how can one etch into three sentences the guilt of an event such as WWII? Ones complicity, mild or otherwise, in genocide? In mass destruction? Macbeth could barely handle a single regicide, what would he do faced with body-littered battlefields and insidious gas chambers; with the ravenous chattering of industrialised slaughter in all its forms? This guilt is not specific to the narrator and his circumstances.  It is a universal guilt.  Rezzori takes as his title the ur-text of fratricide.  The biblical story of Abel and Cain, in which Cain murders his brother out of jealousy and is condemned to a life of wandering- the soil stained with his brothers blood will no longer sustain him.  Cain occupies a strange role, however.  He is both the first murderer and the father of humankind.  He commits the first act of physical violence, and is protected from all future violence.  This paradox hides a deeper interpretative point.  Cain and Abel are the first humans, and are thus, humankind.  In the particular is the universal.  This dynamic plays out in Rezzoris text.  His brother he has killed is not necessarily just a specific individual, but his brother in this universal sense.  Rezzori, or the narrator, or both, display an awareness of this.  They write: \"CAINS MARK OF EXISTENTIAL CONSCIOUSNESS stamped on those who are condemned to recognize in themselves not just any human being but humankind itself\" In this sense the guilt of the narrator is not just specific to his crimes and his complicity, his guilt is the guilt of humankind.  In E. M Ciorans reflections on the poet Paul Celan he writes that \"[r]elations with this deeply torn being were not simple.  He clung to his biases against one person or another, he sustained his mistrust, all the more so because of his pathological fear of being hurt, and everything hurt him. \" In this sketch are echoes of the narrator of Abel and Cain.  Indeed, Celan and Rezzori bear some resemblances: Romanians writing through the trauma of fascism in the very language of its propagation: German.  Yet Celan was Jewish and a survivor of the holocaust, and Rezzori a gentile who may have never heard of a concentration camp until after WWII.  The gulf that exists between them, between Jew and Gentile in the context of WWII, is immense.  But the fracturing of the soul is similar: to be spared the worst does not mean one is spared.  The experience of post-war literature is the experience of the death of experience itself.  The destruction that surrounds the narrator of Abel and Cain, both psychic and physical, is the destruction wrought by the nihilism of WWII, the nihilism of political indifference, economic catastrophe and the failure of humanity.  We are not at this stage yet: there a few bulwarks left between us and devastation.  However, Abel and Cain serves to remind us of the cost of this devastation, one that will be total.  And so Rezzori reaches out to us from a near-forgotten Europe to warn us of both the past and the future, to remind us that we have already lost the world once and we cannot afford to lose it again. ", "article_4": "For Gregor von Rezzori, who died in 1998, Europe \"committed suicide\" in 1914, the year he was born.  Von Rezzoris whole oeuvre is a gay, merciless, tragic reflection on Europes decomposition, a process in which World War II and the Holocaust are hardly more than an aftershock, following which the old continents ways of life disintegrate into techno-abstract homogeneity.  \"Were a rotten people; our culture is rotten,\" he insisted in an interview.  Von Rezzori began writing in earnest only in 1940, as if he thought that from then on there was little left to do but remember and reflect on the catastrophe.  In his many books, the most enduring of which are autobiographical fictions, he expresses scant interest in the times he was living through; \"Pravda,\" a story from 1979, alludes to his glamorous days as a screenwriter in the 1950s and 60s, but even this tale is engrossed with an older history.  Von Rezzoris great theme is the darkening world of Central Europe between the wars.  The paradox is that as Europes remains are gnawed away by fascism, the books narrators, likewise born around 1914, are just starting out in life; these contrary arcs set vitality and decay to fizzing together like a cabaret cocktail.  An Ermine in Czernopol By Gregor von Rezzori.  Translated by Philip Boehm.  Buy this book.  The narrators are loosely based on the author, forming a composite singularity with as many outlines as a Giacometti figure.  Only the \"I\" of von Rezzoris The Death of My Brother Abel (1976) is not an alter ego, and although that massive novel dwells on the ersatz character of postwar Europe, its still marked by the ripples of the Austro-Hungarian Empires destruction and the corruption of sustaining myths.  The three volumes published by NYRB Classics--An Ermine in Czernopol (1958), Memoirs of an Anti-Semite (1979) and The Snows of Yesteryear (1989), the first having just appeared--are worth reading chronologically to sample different incarnations of the same fanciful boy and adolescent, and his later dilettante drift.  To arrive at the last book, a straight family memoir divided into portraits, is like bumping into recurrent fictional characters in a factual, \"real\" space--only to find these people just as captivating as the fun-house-mirror reflections wed met before.  Von Rezzoris father was an Italo-Austrian nobleman, proficient in chemistry and the arts, with a sinecure in Bukovina, where after 1919, when the region passed to Romania, he pretended to uphold a teetering bastion of civilization but really stayed on for the hunting.  A \"pathological\" anti-Semite but too snobbish to be a Nazi, contemptuous of the Anschluss for being a vile Prussianization of the ideal of Greater Germany, he was also a rough-edged life force, more interesting and more loved than his fictional counterparts.  Von Rezzoris mother was a period type: wan, over-refined, disenchanted.  His older sister--tougher than the equally doomed Tanya in Ermine--was a rival for the affections of their father, who, in von Rezzoris opinion, died early from a terminal case of their mothers \"princess in rags\" complex.  This fascinating but demode clan was counterbalanced by a primeval nanny and a cultivated governess, whose portraits bookend Ermine.  For von Rezzori, artistry, understanding and growth were the gifts of these outsiders.  Cassandra, the illiterate, dwarfish peasant from the Carpathians who was the young Gregor Arnulf Hilariuss wet nurse and nanny, raised him with the vigor and imagination his mother lacked.  Even more important than Cassandras cheerfulness and feel for earth, life and death, was her peculiar linguistic genius.  \"Each second or third word was either Ruthenian, Romanian, Polish, Russian, Armenian or Yiddish, not to forget Hungarian and Turkish. \" The boy was fed ancient fairy tales flecked with \"scurrilous verbal creations, word-changelings, semantic homunculi,\" morsels the writer stored up--not only in his sensitivity to the mongrel heritages of Eastern Europe and language itself but in various Cassandra-like characters and the raucous folk-world of Tales of Maghrebinia, a series of once-popular books based on the stories von Rezzori told on the Berlin radio after the war.  When the boy outgrew Cassandra, his moral education continued under Bunchy, a paragon from Pomerania.  Although she failed to persuade her charge to take his lessons seriously, she helped him and his sister endure the linked disintegration of imperial Austria and their parents marriage.  Bunchy also seeded a timely awareness of class and race, and alerted them to the existence of a wider world.  With the candor free of coyness that enables him to write about the most uncomfortable subjects, von Rezzori concludes he owes to Bunchy \"what little virtues I may possess,\" including \"my lifelong striving to overcome a fatal indifference. \" Indeed, his marginal narrators recall Robert Musils \"man without qualities. \" Low and high culture, disorder and measure, East and West: such polarities provide the authors alter egos the leeway to wonder who they are, and allow a sweeping stylistic range, from the satirical to the sublime, all the while cloaking a dispassionate core.  Even in the memoir The Snows of Yesteryear, von Rezzori examines with great lyricism the same dynamics as in his fictions, between tribal identity and individual temperament, inheritance and chance, and depicts them as being compounded by history, time, the zeitgeist.  * * * An Ermine in Czernopol dramatizes a 1920s childhood in a family similar to the von Rezzoris, marooned in a city identical to theirs: Czernopol is the newly Romanian Czernowitz, Ukrainian Chernivtsi today.  In the 1920s, because of its position at the intersection of trading routes and migrant paths, the city was still a caldron of peoples, religions and lingos, \"all living in the cynical harmony that is built on mutual aversion and common business dealings. \" It was also an important hub of Jewish life.  While the narrator provocatively recalls the citys cult of mockery as a sophisticated form of aesthetic intelligence, he is ambiguous about its brutality: \"People laughed, cried, loved, robbed, and thrashed each other at the markets, coupled behind fences, died in the gutter. . . .  The children of the street laughed with the raw, tinny laugh of meanness. \" Against this picaresque backdrop, both an intensely remembered place and the model of a seething, explosive border, the novel explores the disarray of national identities and a childs loss of idealism in the jagged shadow of World War I.  The narrator, his sister Tanya and an uncertain number of siblings are unanimously high-minded and naive.  Theyre unlike children youve ever met, partly because the novels temperament is shaped by the perceptions and interpretations of children but not by their language.  Somehow--thanks perhaps to the majestic \"we\" that conveys their inner progress--von Rezzori gets away with attributing to them the most preposterous and charming thoughts.  Heres a moment in the evolution of \"their\" attitudes to the war: The war, which had very much started as our own but was soon completely remade into \"the Germans war,\" had been presented to us as Siegfrieds battle with the dragon. . . .  We were amazed that people felt it necessary to explain to us exactly how Siegfried felt challenged by the dragon in order to attack it with just cause.  This cause struck us simply as part of his heroic nature. . . .  But now, called upon to admire the wars mechanics and engineers, we found ourselves faced with the unreasonable demand to view Siegfried as a master planner who calculated every sword stroke. . . with a slide-rule. . . .  So we watched the intellects that held him so completely by the threads and gave them our most careful attention, but not our love.  There follows a delicious riff on German soldiers first as termites, then as terrifying metallic larvae, bereft of the \"holy passion\" that ennobles sacrifice.  The anxious perusal of news photos turns Field Marshals Hindenburg and Ludendorff into hot-air balloons, lacking the levity to take off: \"Because as it was, when they stepped out of the train, harnessed by an iron sense of duty, shackled to the earth, they displayed a bombastic sullenness: their swollen and corseted bulges tugged against their moorings. \" Here von Rezzori echoes his fathers distinction between vulgar militarism and chivalric heroism.  The childrens yearning for the latter crystallizes in an infatuation with a solemn mounted hussar, Major Tildy, who has married, with impeccable self-sacrifice, the drug-addicted daughter of the local millionaire peasant.  The gauntlets the major throws down in defense of his whorish sister-in-laws honor draw laughs.  Illusions are coarsely punctured all round.  The precocious narrator must, like the foolish hussar, come down off his high horse, even if to leave childhood \"meant exchanging the inscrutable autocratic splendour that accompanied each new thing as it entered that world for a routine interaction with the all-too-familiar. \" Yes, the novel strays into lushness, but delectable writing and a positively Russian understanding of yearning and nostalgia balance the precise, Musil-like scrutiny of the absurd ex-empire.  At first this duality seems central: von Rezzoris belief in essences leads him to plot the nature and interaction of different populations with endless subtlety, like a taxonomist or a naturalist, in contrast to his romantic treatment of personal transformation.  But its really a continuum.  Characters can change only as their nature allows.  In the words of the wise headmistress of the school the children attend (until the family realize its Jewish): \"In the best case their characters can be fostered.  You cant implant anything, you cant develop anything that isnt already inside them. \" Where social or ethnic groups are concerned, this sense of predetermination results in stereotyping.  Von Rezzoris peasants are dim but crafty; his radicals, heartlessly cerebral.  A catalog of conventional types always underwrites the operation of myths and fables, from primeval fireside tales to Aesop to Maghrebinia.  Thus the Jewish children and adults at the school confirm certain caricatures, and the narrator even remarks on it; yet the sudden human contact with this mystified otherness makes him question his familys anti-Semitism, an \"educated\" blend of disdain and burlesque.  Besides, not only are the Jewish kids deeper and more worldly than he; they possess another--tellingly aristocratic--virtue: \"the superiority of an older race. \" When the Jewish football team trounces the pro-German Romanian one, and the post-match brawl turns into a citywide pogrom, the narrator cheers on his new heroes: From the darkness of the chestnut trees. . . a troop emerged and fell upon the plundering mob like a flock of avenging angels.  They were muscular young men dressed in white linen pants covered with flour; their shirts were open, and their heads were covered in little visorless felt caps--apprentices from the numerous kosher bakeries. . . .  And leading them into battle was a Jewish Mars, a stout god of war. . . his fat face flushed red like David when he became a man. . . .  It was Dr.  Salzmann [their mild, tolerant religion teacher] in his hour of greatness.  The novels analysis of the psychology of prejudice does not hinge on the simple matter of redemption, of turning \"bad\" stereotypes into good, the \"humble\" into the martial.  True to his belief that people cant really change, von Rezzori shows with riveting, agonized panache, and from within the subjectivity of his narrators, that if youve had a certain upbringing, no matter what you think, feel or do, you are still--more or less unconsciously, always insurmountably--prejudiced.  And if anti-Semitism is the emblematic sin of interwar Europe, its linked to other imaginary hierarchies with real effects, such as class and nation.  For the author and his generation, at any rate, theres no escape.  Rather than a condemnation of prejudice, Memoirs of an Anti-Semite insists that we are doomed to be its accomplices.  * * * Leaner and funnier than An Ermine in Czernopol--more Nabokov than Musil--Memoirs of an Anti-Semite presents itself as \"A Novel in Five Stories. \" All but the last are set in four successive periods, from about 1927 to 1938.  Each narrator speaks in the voice of the familiar \"I\" who shares much of the authors background and biography, along with his feckless temperament and vacillating sense of identity.  With slightly different trajectories and experiences, they remain callow despite growing older, indeed more suave and superficial, as calamity approaches.  Each story revolves around an encounter with Jews that the protagonist experiences as averagely annoying, humiliating or good fun; only the reader knows how little time remains.  In \"Skushno,\" 13-year-old Bubi, expelled from his Styrian boarding school for \"inability to learn,\" is staying with relatives in the country near Czernowitz.  Mincing ridiculously around the woods clad in an imitation of an old German drinking-fraternity costume (he is going through a Sturm und Drang phase, thrilled by the \"bitterness of anticipated futility\" in those masculine songs), Bubi is befriended by Wolf, a tough, rude Jewish doctors son who is also a brilliant pianist.  Wolf tramples cheerfully over Bubis romanticism, forcing him to see the lewdness around him and mocking the stupidity of the goyim, until the boy takes a half-meant, cowardly revenge.  \"Skushno\" is followed by \"Youth,\" set in 1933 Bucharest, where an adolescent on the cusp of adulthood is prey to lust, insecurity and high-flown fancies about himself.  He becomes a cosmetics salesman, a lowly job that nevertheless provides passage into the citys exotic neighborhoods, where he seduces Gypsy girls and imbibes the Orient at Mr.  Garabetians Armenian bazaar (all the authors prototypes are primarily watchers, the perfect position for the writer that \"I\" never is).  He falls for a middle-aged Jewish shopkeeper, when at the first tentative clinch he notes \"the sudden transformation of an age-old fear into joy. . . .  This change in her face was what made me love her. \" He worships the ancient suffering she embodies--until he hits her in public, exasperated by her petty-bourgeois airs.  He thereby loses both her and the respect of the working-class characters he was flattered to know: he has been identified not as a lofty soul but as a member of \"a caste that blemished me, as though I were Jewish. \" Von Rezzori shows the merged mechanisms of class and race as too ingrained and shape-shifting to be overcome.  \"Lowingers Rooming House\" performs a similar operation with sex and race in late-1930s Vienna, as Nazism gains ground among the sort of people who cant decide whether \"Jewesses\" are Jews or common bitches.  The third story is \"Troth,\" which briefly made von Rezzoris name when it appeared in The New Yorker in 1969.  A lot happens in flashback.  Theres another whirl through that inexhaustible childhood and its contradictory heritages, here developed in the light of the schism between the two Roman Empires.  A harsh portrait of the parents is accompanied by the narrators startling anti-Semitic rants, deploring for instance the way upstart rich Jews change their names as camouflage for \"their repulsive social climbing. \" (The proud or the submissive sort are no better; hatred precedes its justifications. ) While reproducing some of his parents opinions, the narrator tries to snub them by embracing identities theyd scorn--Romanian or Turkish.  Interleaved with these vignettes is the tale of his friendship with Jewish Minka, a happy flapper who lives upstairs in his grandmothers building in Vienna.  When he is 17 she brings him to bed, more as a toy than a boyfriend, and the affair remains tender and uncomplicated for years, because \"there was a taboo that controlled my feelings. \" He is even rescued from his defiant provincialism by Minkas circle of Jewish artists and bohemians: \"That little kingdom of hers, which became my universe, was composed of all that was best in Vienna in the early 1930s, the most intellectual and most amusing. \" It seems contradictory, but thats the point.  One feeling does not prevent another where Jews are concerned.  As events gather pace in the Reich, Salzburg \"was just awful.  It was overrun with Jews.  The worst of them had come from Germany as refugees and, in spite of their luggage-laden Mercedes cars, behaved as if they were the victims of a cruel persecution. \" By 1938 even carefree Minka is worried.  \"'Oh, dont exaggerate, I said.  'You Jews are always making a fuss about something. \" The honesty of this tale precludes the smallest moment of self-redemptive remorse.  The final story, \"Pravda,\" unfolds in the third person and is set much later, as a feverish retrospection involving judgments and excuses.  In her introduction to Memoirs of an Anti-Semite, Deborah Eisenberg asks, \"Who is this 'he, this other, whom life has made us? When did we split off from ourselves, and. . . our received view of things?\" The answer is surely when the war and the Final Solution got going.  The elderly man walking down Via Veneto in 1979 rummages desperately through his guilty recollections, in search of the fragments of disconnected lives that were necessarily unreal, as his parents values were already obsolete in 1918: he is \"a child of sleepwalkers--growing up in a dreamed world, sometimes nightmarish. . . predestined to lose every kind of reality. \" Again, he is at once a literary creation and a version of the real von Rezzori, so that when the character admits that self-reinvention has allowed him to dodge any \"out-and-out collision with reality,\" we think of the authors self-reinventions in art, too.  And when von Rezzori wonders that \"perhaps what allows him to feel unalterably himself is also his perpetual changing,\" he has foregrounded the fluctuating \"I\"s of the books.  But ambiguous consistency is no answer to Pilates question.  The Jewish encounter here is fittingly, then, a case of fiction within fiction.  The narrator met his \"second, Jewish wife\" at a nouvelle vague film shoot.  She was nominally Jewish; she was more imbued with Catholic culture, and had survived the war thanks to the devotion of an SS man who saw her as \"the very model of a German girl. \" But as soon as a child arrived, she and the narrator began helplessly to invent each other according to ancestral habit, as the drama-queen Jew and the inconstant goy.  They taunted each other in \"theological\" arguments over truth, she playing the authentic, the literalist, the absolutist; he, the ironical aesthete.  After the divorce, they fought over what was to be the spiritual heritage of their child.  \"No, it was good that the boy had died early\"; he would have been destroyed by the contentions re-created by this apparently enlightened couple out of thin air.  The two \"races\" had become mirror images of each others irreducibility.  In 1986 von Rezzori published an essay in Vanity Fair about following the tracks of Humbert Humbert.  He confessed to loving the motels and highways of Lolitaland, deeming their ahistorical plasticity the very core of America.  It was an imaginative alternative to Old Europe, which had been destroyed by the logic of its nature long ago. ", "article_5": "\"The past is a foreign country: they do things differently there,\" begins L.  P.  Hartleys 1953 novel The Go-Between.  There is a hazy sense in which Hartleys iconic opening applies to every life: The passage from childhood to adulthood always involves a kind of expatriation.  But for Romanian(ish) writer Gregor von Rezzori, the force of Hartleys formulation is literal.  Rezzoris past is at least three different countries, and things are done differently in each of them.  Rezzori was born in 1914 in what was then Czernowitz, a Romanian outpost of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.  His parents were Sicilian aristocrats, dutiful Hapsburg subjects who spoke High German at home.  Bred for a life of luxurious cosmopolitanism, Rezzori could scrape by in English, Romanian, Italian, French, Ukrainian, Yiddish, and Polish.  His polyglotism served him well when the empire he was born to govern collapsed.  In 1918, his birthplace was briefly reborn as Romanian Cernauti.  In 1944, it assumed its current identity as the Ukrainian city of Chernivtsi.  When Rezzori returned years later, he could no longer find the house he grew up in.  \"You must never undertake the search for time lost in the spirit of nostalgic tourism,\" he concludes in his 1989 memoir, The Snows of Yesteryear.  He remained stateless for much of his adult life.  What was it like in the lost lands of Rezzoris youth? Mostly, it seems, it was light there.  In Rezzoris loosely autobiographical novel An Ermine in Czernopol (1958), his narrator eulogizes a childhood in which \"everything seemed sharper, brighter, and more intense. \" In The Snows of Yesteryear, Rezzori announces that \"with the end of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, a light was extinguished that until then had bathed the days in a golden sheen. \" And in Abel and Cain, a nearly nine-hundred-page colossus out from New York Review Books this spring, another wistful Pan-European reports that his first memories are full of \"light falling obliquely through a large window, slanting across a bright room. \" Even the spring of 1938, when Hitler marched into Vienna, was eerily luminous.  The early days of Nazism were blessed with \"Hitler weather,\" \"an icy cold blue sky and a Sunday glow. \" Is the harsh glint of \"Hitler weather\" part of what Rezzori, in the guise of his narrators, misses? He never says as much.  But after all his talk of glitter and glow, I cant help but wonder.  Abel and Cain weds two subsidiary books that have never before been published as a single volume.  The first, The Death of My Brother Abel, was released in German in 1976 and translated into faulty English in 1985.  The second, Cain, is something of an afterthought: Originally published two years after Rezzoris 1998 death, it has not appeared in English translation until now.  The joint product is too discursive to summarize, and Im sure that Rezzori, or at least his narratorial ambassador, would accept the charge of plotlessness with pride.  Aristides Subicz, the protagonist of The Death of My Brother Abel, balks when a sleazy literary agent asks him for a three-sentence recap of the book he has been writing fitfully for decades.  By way of reply, he rants for close to six hundred pages, most of them crammed with complaint.  Subicz is a gentile, patrician Portnoy.  He reviles and envies his ex-friend, the commercially successful novelist Nagel (who may be a caricature of Nobel Prize winner and sometime Nazi collaborator Gunter Grass).  He wonders if it is possible or profitable to write in the wake of giants like Musil.  (In this he resembles Rezzori, who once told an interviewer, \"I cant read ten lines of Robert Musil and keep on writing, I stop for a week at least. \") With cutting irony (and sometimes begrudging reverence) he recalls his beautiful mother and her many suitors, his so-called \"uncles. \" Foremost among these is Uncle Ferdinand, his probable father and an inhabitant of the \"beau monde of the monstrously rich,\" with their \"many beautiful houses in all the most beautiful places on this wondrously beautiful earth; their parks and shooting grounds; their oceangoing yachts, polo ponies, Rolls-Royces, and Bugattis. \" The few people Subicz loves without any trace of condescension are dead.  His mistress, a Jewish heiress named Stella, perished in the Holocaust.  His editor and champion, tortured literatus Johannes Schwab, drank himself to death.  What Subicz craves is not a story that can be summed up in three sentences but a wholesale resurrection--not just of his friends, but also of the extinct European animal.  \"I, for my part, am haunted by the loss of a full half of my life.  I would like to conjure up the vanished reality of that half,\" he confesses.  At fashionable Theosophist seances in the 20s, Subiczs petit bourgeois relatives summoned spirits, and Abel and Cain makes a similar effort to recover both the departed and the zeitgeist that died out with them.  Subicz wonders, as he writes Schwab back to life, if \"the demonic power of words on the page has awakened a dead man. \" But he also fears the inverse--that he has committed a murder.  For years, he is tormented by guilty nightmares in which he bludgeons an old woman to death.  Whom exactly does Subicz believe he has killed? There are many candidates.  He supports himself by writing movies that he takes to be strangling literature.  (Rezzori, too, paid his bills with screenplays. ) Stella is hauled off to a concentration camp because she makes an ill-advised effort to rendezvous with him in Nazified Berlin.  He is indirectly responsible for the death of his cousin Wolfgang, who contracts a fatal infection after the oak leaves Subicz has stuffed into his rifle, per German military tradition, cause the gun to backfire.  But only one person is Subiczs \"spiritual brother,\" so only one person could be the Abel to his Cain.  The ultimate casualty in Abel and Cain is Schwab.  Schwab is not, Subicz hastens to remind himself, \"merely a personification of my literary conscience: he is.  He is S. , my dead friend. \" Still, Subicz colonizes--and thereby cannibalizes--Schwab, whom he misrepresents in his writing.  In Cain, a two-hundred-page footnote to The Death of My Brother Abel, Schwab takes his meager revenge: In a series of notes for a novel that he dies without finishing, he reveals that he planned to write about Subicz in exchange.  The murder, it seems, is mutual.  So writing both mangles and memorializes.  It immortalizes its subjects, but it also flattens them into characters.  East German novelist and dissident Christa Wolf noted as much in The Quest for Christa T.  (1968), a slim slip of a novel that predates The Death of My Brother Abel by eight years.  Wolfs narrator insists she would gladly exchange her commemorative efforts for the live substance of her dead friend.  \"If I were to have to invent her, I wouldnt change her.  Id let her live,\" she writes.  The Quest for Christa T.  is an elegant elegy to its namesake, and it accomplishes in two hundred pages what Rezzori takes a small eternity to never quite achieve.  Abel and Cain is fat with cliche-curdled reflections on the violence implicit in fiction.  Subiczs many meditations on the futility of literature after Joyce are prompted not by the kind of world-historical concerns that inspired Adorno to ask if we can pen poetry after Auschwitz, but by Subiczs worries (justified, as it turns out) that he will not measure up.  \"Why bother with a novel today? What else remained to be said?\" he whines.  \"Why write at all, nowadays?\" he gripes twenty pages later.  \"We are told on all sides that the novel is dead, and thats because its last great theme is exhausted,\" he continues a hundred pages after that.  And so on and on--and on and on.  There is no doubt that Rezzori is an important writer, maybe even a great one.  He is well worth reading for the pleasure of his tangled language alone.  Memoirs of an Anti-Semite, his best-known book, merits its reputation as a tour de force.  But Subicz is a mean-spirited mouthpiece.  He calls the movie producers he works for \"piglets. \" He is almost unbelievably uncharitable toward his ex-wife, whom he dismisses as mercenary for worrying about unliterary trivialities like starving to death in undersupplied postwar Hamburg.  He is consistently and gratuitously sexist.  He subjects the women he sleeps with to tirades that even he acknowledges are tiresome.  He is always chattering, he admits, \"tormented, pigheaded, and persistent, at some then-beloved female.  Sputtering verbal figures wrung from necessity: aphorisms, sublimated from my spiritual ordeal. \" This is as good a summary of Abel and Cain as any--and in just two sentences! The book is salvaged, insofar as it is salvaged, by its occasional outbursts of love--and by the feats of observation that love can sometimes occasion.  Subicz catches his aunt lost in thought and muses, \"She hears herself like a faraway melody. \" He remarks that a buzzer makes a sound like \"a wasp squashed under a shoe. \" He praises the \"sparkle of frost flowers\" blooming on winter windowpanes.  But even Subiczs love is suspect.  He lapses into tenderness only when he invokes his enchanted childhood, an idyll that elapsed in the gemutlich old Austrian Empire.  The pristine scenes of Alpine life--the elaborate teas served on tiered trays, the hunts in the frost-fringed forests, the jingling of the Christmas sleighs that glide past houses I can only presume are half-timbered--are indeed seductive.  A bell peals from a church nestled in the foothills on every other page.  We spend hours in Uncle Ferdinands lavish bathroom, which is stocked with prewarmed towels.  \"Our souls lived in that old world of faraway times, when Nuremberg was renowned for its Lebkuchen and its toy boxes, not for its trials and the subsequent gallows,\" writes Subicz.  Before the spectacle of the death camps, \"the gingerbread houses crowded in intricate confusion around the cute dignity of the stepped town-hall gables, shadowed by the heavenward soaring of cathedrals. \" Is he joking? Rezzoris nostalgia resurfaces so often and so vehemently that it cannot be wholly facetious.  He remarks with apparent sincerity that the years between two world wars comprised \"a time, a lifetime, more stimulating than could ever have been experienced before or after. \" Is the conflation of private and historical losses innocuous? Or does Rezzori miss the lacquered world he once lived in because the inequalities that prevailed there were so much to his benefit? Francine du Plessix Gray once observed that he retained a \"majestic courtly manner,\" which \"made him look as if he were perennially hosting a reception in some Middle European palace. \" Its only natural that he mourns the palace that would have been his birthright--if only those pesky gallows hadnt pockmarked Nurembergs Ruritanian skyline.  Subicz tries to justify his Hapsburg hagiography by criticizing the dynastys successors: He inveighs with predictable vitriol against the Americanization transforming Europe into \"Yurop. \" \"Hamburg is no longer what surrounds me here,\" he writes from an anonymous high-rise.  \"It could just as well be Detroit or Sofia or even Minsk.  It is purely and simply suburbia, a geographic superreality with no precise location. \" Today, he laments, \"all we have is a supranational style, and this style is American. \" But was the international republic of the \"monstrously rich,\" where Subicz spent his formative years, any less homogenous? Subicz himself reports that its denizens frequented the same resorts, wore the same clothing, and spoke the same hodgepodge of languages.  My point is not that Rezzori should renounce all the charms of his childhood, which was, no doubt, very charming.  Nor do I hope to impose on every prewar memory a retroactive taint.  My point is just that a nine-hundred-page book can vindicate its self-importance only if it succeeds as an aesthetic exercise.  As Rezzori noted with despairing jealousy, Musils tomes pass the test.  But Abel and Cain cannot justify the demands that it makes on its readers.  It is often beautiful, but it is frequently as kitschy as a cuckoo clock.  Subicz shamelessly mythologizes \"a Europe that might still be European\"--but I doubt if this European Europe was really so golden for everyone.  Better rain than the brutal--and banal--luminescence of Hitler weather.  Becca Rothfeld is a Ph. D.  candidate in philosophy at Harvard. ", "article_6": "Gregor von Rezzori Gregor von Rezzori (1914-1998) was born in Czernowitz (now Chernivtsi, Ukraine), Bukovina, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.  He later described his childhood in a family of declining fortunes as one \"spent among slightly mad and dislocated personalities in a period that also was mad and dislocated and filled with unrest.  After studying at the University of Vienna, Rezzori moved to Bucharest and enlisted in the Romanian army.  During World War II , he lived in Berlin, where he worked as a radio broadcaster and published his first novel.  In West Germany after the war, he wrote for both radio and film and began publishing books at a rapid rate, including the four-volume Idiots Guide to German Society.  From the late 1950s on, Rezzori had parts in several French and West German films, including one directed by his friend Louis Malle.  In 1967, after spending years classified as a stateless person, Rezzori settled in a fifteenth-century farmhouse outside of Florence with his wife, gallery owner Beatrice Monte della Corte.  There he produced some of his best-known works, among themand the memoir(both published by NYRB Classics). ", "article_7": "Gregor von Rezzori, the only son of a loveless marriage, entered the world at an unpropitious time--1914--and in an inauspicious place--the city formerly known as Czernowitz, capital of the region known as Bukovina, in the final days of the Hapsburg empire.  He was a refugee before his first birthday and would never find a way back home.  That \"lost, bygone world, golden and miraculous,\" as Rezzori calls it in his recently reissued 1989 memoir, The Snows of Yesteryear, had been destroyed in the cruelest war the world had ever seen.  By the time he was old enough to speak, he was already nostalgic \"for something forever lost, something I had already lost the moment I was born. \" Rezzori would devote his writing life to this curious nostalgia for a world he had never really experienced, and whose protracted death throes it had been his misfortune to experience--in the unhappy role of \"flotsam of the European class struggle. \" In contrast to his elder sister, born four years earlier, \"before the general proletarianization of the postwar era, in a world that still believed itself to be whole,\" Rezzori had been, as he put it, \"a true son of the era of universal disintegration. \" His writings concern the fate of people like himself, belonging to \"a dying and largely superannuated caste,\" and forced to live amid the ruins.  He made it through the two world wars intact and found a comfortable place for himself in the new world, which he occupied with the great ambivalence of an exile from a place to which there can be no return.  He wrote radio scripts and screenplays, acted in films, married an Italian countess, and wrote a series of German-language novels whose reputation has steadily waxed with the passage of the years.  He died in 1998, having outlasted \"the short 20th century,\" as the historian Eric Hobsbawm called it, referring to the great class struggle that divided Europe until 1989.  He has found in NYRB Classics, which reissued The Snows of Yesteryear and published his 1979 novel Memoirs of an Anti-Semite in 2007, a devoted steward of his legacy.  Part of what lent that lost world its golden aura was the deference it gave to German-speaking servants of the emperor, such as Rezzoris family.  Amid the wild palimpsest of peoples deposited by centuries of conquest and migration in Eastern Europe--Romanians, Ruthenians, Hungarians, Armenians, Bulgarians, Germans, Poles, Greeks, Turks, and Jews--the Austrians assumed the role of \"cultural compost,\" the self-deprecating term that Gregors father used to name the virtual monopoly on political, cultural, and economic power held by a city-dwelling German minority in the east.  The city to which the Rezzoris returned in 1919 was now part of the new state of Romania, in which the Rezzoris found they were \"taken over by another class to which we deemed ourselves superior but which, in fact, treated us as second-rate citizens. \" On the one hand, losing their place at the top of the racialized caste system that had permitted the many nations of Eastern Europe to live together in peace was, \"for the class to which my parents belonged,\" he wrote, \"a fall into chaos, into impotence and deprivation, hopelessness and squalor. \" Then again, \"humiliation merely aggrandized, as humiliation suffered by the kinds of people who considered ourselves members of a class of masters,\" will often do, the familys threadbare pretensions to greatness: We felt excluded, but on the other hand, our isolation made us feel out of the ordinary and even that we belonged to a chosen elite.  The myth of lost wealth rankled in us but also made us arrogant.  All our efforts were directed at not being deemed declasse.  This disappointed upbringing, spent in \"cannibalistic solitude\" among hostile strangers (a short distance from the Dniester River, the border across which the bloody birth pangs of a new proletarian utopia were taking place), made Rezzori an acute witness to the psychological condition of the Germans between the wars.  Something new and dire had been unleashed into the world by the carnage of the Great War.  \"A species of men arose from that ghostly landscape of bomb craters and trenches whose bestiality was unconstrained,\" Rezzori wrote.  \"A free field was given to the Hitlers and Stalins to come. \" Whereas the Rezzoris fled the loss of their privileges into self-devouring neurotic obsession (the exhaustive exposition of which makes up the bulk of The Snows of Yesteryear), other Germans responded more actively.  Aggrieved at the loss of their position, morally adrift in a world in which the old traditions and hierarchies had been destroyed, thirsting for a return to greatness, inured to mechanized violence, fearful of the Bolshevik menace from the East, and even more fearful of morally subversive elements within, certain elements of the German people went on a search for scapegoats.  They readily found them in the Jews.  Memoirs of an Anti-Semite is in many ways the fictional counterpart to The Snows of Yesteryear, sharing with it a social, geographical, and cultural setting, and many individual anecdotes.  A loose collection of five long thematically linked short stories, the book follows its protagonist, Arnulf, through a series of episodes in which he finds himself engaged with Jews as friends, rivals, employers, business partners, persecutors, and above all, lovers--first a middle-aged Jewish shopkeeper, then the orphaned daughter of a Viennese professor, and lastly, in a short-lived second marriage, a Jewish woman who was nonetheless, as he puts it, \"truly the most goyish shikseh he had ever encountered. \" Arnulf is emphatically not a Hitlerite monster, or a Nazi street brawler, but, like Rezzori, a well-bred Austrian from a civil service family in the former Bukovina.  He exhibits, without apology, the social snobbery of his class, but none of the racial resentment of the Nazis.  He is a believer in settled hierarchies, fixed institutions, and people who know their place in the world: The specifically Jewish quality in Jews had never repelled me so much as the attempt--doomed from the start--to hush it up, to cover it over, to deny it.  The yiddling of Jews, their jittery gesticulation, their disharmony, the incessant alternation of obsequiousness and presumptuousness, were inescapable and inalienable attributes of their Jewishness.  If they acted as one expected them to act, so that one could recognize them at first, one was rather pleasantly touched.  They were true to themselves--that was estimable.  The 19-year-old Arnulfs contempt for those who refuse to know their place is transparently a compensation for a man who has lost his own place.  He moves to Bucharest after the war and finds himself working as a window dresser for a cosmetics company--\"a hod carrier, an out and out menial, for mostly Jewish shopkeepers. \" He finds himself woefully unprepared for the job.  Stuck amid the ups and downs of the commercial cycle, Arnulf learns empathy for the Jews.  \"Their hereditary milieu was the world of open possibilities, in which a man could just as easily become a Midas as get stuck in the lowliest form of donkey work,\" he says.  \"I now understood their restlessness, their anxieties, their messianic expectations, the abrupt change from immeasurable arrogance to shamefaced self-debasement. \" Rezzori has a remarkable lyric gift that he uses to describe the wide expanses of Bukovina.  In a series of beautiful set pieces, he evokes the vanishing world of Germanic chivalry, already in its last stages of degeneration into the debased kitsch that the Nazis would exploit, the emerging commercial melee of post-war Bucharest with its Armenian and Jewish shopkeepers and its red light district; and shabby-genteel Vienna, where he socializes almost exclusively with Jewish artists and musicians.  He is a great hit at their parties, telling Yiddish stories and jokes he has learned on the streets of Bucharest, Czernowitz, and Lvov.  Later he accidentally finds himself caught up in the surging crowds celebrating the Anschluss that brought the rump state of German Austria into the Third Reich.  He is on his way to meet his girlfriend, whom he plans to marry.  \"The morbid, rhythmic stamping of their feet hung like a gigantic swinging cord in the silence that had fallen on Vienna,\" he writes: What the hell are we marching for? I asked the man beside me.  \"Anschluss,\" he barked.  Well, that literally meant \"connection,\" and that was exactly what I was looking for.  Should a book about the deadliest hatred of the 20th century, particularly one by a German, be so mordantly funny, so cheerfully alive? But this, of course, is how people live history.  They are inattentive and self-absorbed; they worry about their next sexual conquest while the conquest of the world is being planned in distant chancelleries.  Memoirs of an Anti-Semite is a horror story precisely because it so resolutely refuses to feel like one.  The story it tells is of a passive, attenuated complicity, which is all the more harrowing for its passivity--for without this passivity which encompassed all but a heroic, and mostly destroyed, few, none of the worst crimes of the Nazi regime would have been possible.

Born in Saint-Jean-de-Luz, France, a Basque fishing village, he served in the French Army during World War I before returning home to become the French champion in main nues, pala and chistera, all varieties of Basque pelota.  In 1922, Etchebaster was encouraged by tennis player Jacques Worth (a president of a Paris court club) to take up the game of real tennis.  His first time on the court was during his audition to be the head professional of the club.  After a few minutes of play, he was selected to fill the role.  George Plimpton wrote that this was equivalent to \"picking up a baseball bat in the morning and playing for the New York Yankees in the afternoon. \" Despite losing his first challenge to Fred Covey in 1927, Etchebaster returned in his customary blue beret to win the world championship in London in 1928.  He emigrated to New York City in 1930 to be a professional at the Racquet and Tennis Club.  Etchebaster proceeded to dominate the sport.  He was the world champion for a record-breaking 26 years (1928-1954) until his retirement at the age of 60.  He defended the title seven times -- a feat unmatched until 2006 when Robert Fahey made his seventh title defense (Fahey successfully defended his title eleven times).  He would spend hours a day on court practising his shots, and studying the spin effects the various surfaces of the court had on the ball.  In 1955 he was awarded the Legion d'honneur for his achievements, and in 1978 he was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame.  After his retirement in 1971, a book of his coaching advice, Pierre's Book, was published.  It including accolades from many of the world's best players.  He died in Saint-Jean-de-Luz.  For many years shared his time between his summer position as a lawn tennis professional at Piping Rock Club, Locust Valley, NY and his role as head professional at the Racquet and Tennis Club on Park Avenue in New York.  Each spring he would spend a month in Aiken, South Carolina, the site of one of the nine real tennis courts in the United States, where he would give lessons and play exhibitions.

View Article", "article_2": "The Royal & Ancient Game of Tennis: A Short History by Allison Danzig Compliments of The United States Court Tennis Association & The United States Court Tennis Preservation Foundation IF PERCHANCE you read that Pierre Etchebaster and Jay Gould were the two greatest tennis players of the past half century, quite understandably, gentle reader, you might rise in righteous wrath to demand, \"Pierre who? Jay who? What about Tilden, Budge, Cochet, Lacoste, Perry, Kramer, Laver, Gonzales, Rosewall?\" And you would be perfectly justified - unless you are an Englishman.  For \"tennis\" in England does not mean the same thing it does in the United States.  There it is the name of a game going back to the Middle Ages.  When the British refer to the sport in which Tilden, Laver, et al excelled, they are talking about lawn tennis - whether it is played on a lawn, on clay, dirt, cement, asphalt, concrete, wood, or a composition surface.  What the British call \"tennis\" (also known to them as real tennis or royal tennis) is labeled \"court tennis\" in the United States.  It was in this game that Gould and Etchebaster were supreme, and it is the game from which lawn tennis was derived late in the 19th century.  Whereas it is estimated that 12 million Americans today play lawn tennis on one or more of the many surfaces available, the game of court tennis is virtually unknown in this country, except to approximately one thousand men and women who play it on ten courts - all in the East and costing well up in six figures each - and to their families and friends.  But it is a fascinating game of ingenious complexity, challenging the mental and physical powers of the players as do few other games.  Strange nomenclature, standardized opening and abutments in the enclosures in which it is played, an inexhaustible variety of strokes - all add to the intriguing quality of the game.  Tennis was the game of Napoleon, Henry VIII, and many other of Europes leading monarchs; it was played in the Louvre and at Versailles, and is mentioned in literature more than any other sport.  It has been said of court tennis that it is a game of moving chess, that it combines the exactitude of billiards, the hand-eye coordination of lawn tennis, and the generalship and quick judgment of polo.  When Maj.  William C Winfield invented lawn tennis in 1874, its royal ancestor was already centuries old.  Today, millions play lawn tennis and a handful of men and women keep the original game alive.  Like lawn tennis, court tennis is played by two contestants (four in doubles) with racquets and balls on a court divided by a sagging net, and the scoring is virtually the same in the two games.  There the similarities end.  Not only are the court, racquet, and ball all different from those used in lawn tennis, but the rules of play are so complex and different that the lawn tennis player is baffled on first sight of action in the ancient game.  Terms such as penthouse - as well as dedans, tambour, grille, winning gallery, hazard, giraffe, railroad, chase the door, chase better than a half, chase more than a yard worse than last gallery - describe strokes and features of the play, and add to the mystery of the game.  The court is an indoor, four-walled structure of concrete.  There are numerous openings in the walls, and a \"penthouse\" or roofed shed runs along one sidewall and both endwalls.  In playing the game, the service must first strike on the penthouse roof, and thereafter the ball may be played off the floor, in midair, off the shed roof or the walls of the court.  Points are scored in some ways similar to lawn tennis, as when the ball goes into the net or out of bounds, or hits on second bounce in certain areas of the court.  But points are also scored by hitting the ball into openings in the walls.  On top of these wrinkles to the game is one known as the chase, the \"divine chase\" as one enthusiast called it, in which by precise placement of the ball one player can defer final decision of a point to a new situation (the chase) in which his opponents field and options of play are severely limited.  (Play of the game is illustrated on the following pages. ) While strength and stamina are important, accuracy and strategy are keys to successful play.  Laying down difficult chases is the heart of the game, and to do this calls for skill in cutting the ball down with the characteristic court tennis stroke, imparting spin to keep it low and make it fall near the endwall on second bounce.  Length of stroke pays off as in lawn tennis, but too much depth results in the ball striking the floor so near the endwall as to rebound from the wall far out in the court to establish a chase (or deferred point) not difficult to beat.  Jay Gould, U. S.  amateur champion from 1906 until he retired in 1926, champion of England in 1907 and 1908, and winner over world open champion G.  F.  Covey of Britain in their 1914 challenge match in Philadelphia, was particularly feared for his ability to lay down chase \"better than a half\" (or within half a yard of the endwall), as well as for his \"railroad\" service.  Pierre Etchebaster of France, world open champion from 1928 until he retired undefeated in 1954, and a resident of this country for virtually all those years and since, was masterful in his artistry in playing the floor game.  Tom Pettitt, who came to this country from England at the age of 12 in 1876 and won the world championship in 1885 in Hampton Court, England, was a tremendous hitter who relied less on finesse and touch than on power and accuracy in attacking the winning openings.  The origin of court tennis is shrouded in antiquity.  Its beginnings have been traced all the way back to the fertility rites of the Egyptians and Persians, in which the ball was the symbol of fertility.  As long ago as 450 B. C.  Herodotus referred to tennis.  More definitely, the game of today began to take shape many centuries later as a pastime of monks and other ecclesiasts in France.  In the formative period of the game it was played outdoors and the ball was struck with the hand.  The racquet was not introduced until early in the 16th century, after the use of a glove, then thong bindings, and next a paddle, known as a battoir when a handle was added.  The name of the game was jeu de paume (game of the palm).  The game in the open air was being played at least as early as the 12th century, when it was mentioned by ecclesiastical writers.  A bishop about 1200 was reprimanded for neglecting evensong to play tennis, and in 1245 the Archbishop of Rouen prohibited priests of France from playing jeu de paume.  Private courts were built as the game became secularized, the earliest on record being at Poitiers in 1230.  The introduction of paume into towns and its confinement in indoor courts there marked one of the great changes in the game, leading to its wide appeal.  Walled-in courts were built in the latter part of the 14th century.  Charles V built one in the palace of the Louvre in 1368.  In time these indoor courts were known as jeu de courte paume (short tennis), while outdoors they were called jeu de longue paume (long tennis).  The indoor courts, as Malcolm Whitman concluded after years of careful research in writing his Tennis Origins and Mysteries, appears to have been a gradual evolution from rooms of various shapes in many types of structure - cathedrals, cloisters, chateaux, castles, moats, and even cowsheds.  Relics of these medieval structures are found in the modern court, with features supposedly reminiscent of church architecture in the present-day courts tambour (flying buttress), grille (buttery hatch), penthouse (part of cloisters), and galleries (cowsheds).  From being the game of bishops, priests, and monks, paume became the pastime of monarchs and the royalty surrounding them and was taken up in the towns in gambling establishments.  It became so popular and public gambling was so widespread and for such enormous stakes that in 1369 Charles V restricted the playing of the game in Paris.  From France tennis was introduced into England, supposedly by French cavaliers by way of coastal towns.  That the game was well established by the latter half of the 14th century is evident from the enactment in 1365 of statutes against playing it and other games in England.  These restrictions affected servants and laborers, but not the upper classes.  During the reign of the Tudors - Henry VII and VIII, Edward VI, Elizabeth I - tennis achieved its greatest vogue in England, with royalty and gentlemen of the court devoted to it.  During the period of the Stuarts, beginning with James I in 1603, its popularity continued.  In France too the game flourished in the 1500s and 1600s, and it was the pastime of all classes in both countries, as well as in Germany, Spain, Italy, and other countries of Southern Europe.  In 1600 the Venetian ambassador to France wrote that there were 1,800 courts in Paris alone.  In England, with the country plunged in civil war during the rebellion in the reign of Charles I (1625-1649), the tennis courts were deserted and remained so during the period of the Commonwealth, with Puritans frowning on amusement of any kind.  But with the Restoration and accession of Charles II, the Cromwellian asceticism ended and tennis was the pastime of the upper and middle classes for the rest of the 1600s and in the 1700s.  With the rise of professionalism, heavy betting on the matches and swindling brought the game on public courts into disrepute in the latter half of the 1700s in both England and France.  The Revolution and the downfall of the monarchy and aristocracy were virtually the death knell of the game in France, almost every court being closed, and in England the game was played only by the upper classes.  In both England and France the game picked up in the 1800s.  In France there was a definite recovery during the time of Napoleon III, especially with the reopening of Versailles in 1885 for use as a tennis court.  (Today it stands as a museum dedicated to the French Revolution. ) In 1862 Napoleon gave permission to build the Jeu de Paume in the Tuileries Gardens near the Place de la Concorde.  A second court was added in 1880 and the two courts were headquarters of the game in Paris until closed in 1907 to become exhibition halls, which were remodeled in 1958 as a museum for impressionist paintings.  To replace the courts, amateurs built new ones at Rue Lauriston, where competition for the Coupe de Paris was inaugurated in 1910.  Jeu de paume is still played there, along with squash racquets, by a small group of British, American, and French members, but the game has never since remotely approached the wide popularity it knew in the 16th and 17th centuries.  The spectacular rise of the French Basque, Pierre Etchebaster, to become world champion in 1928, six years after he took up the game, stimulated a revival at Rue Lauriston.  There was a revival too at Bordeaux, and at Pau.  In Italy few traces remain of the old game.  Whitman reproduced a proclamation dated 1659 by Peter Stuyvesant as governor of New York, proscribing the playing of tennis and other games during divine services on a day of fasting and prayer.  In England many private courts were built in the 19th century; prior to World War I there were close to 100.  Since then mounting taxes and the closing of large estates led to most of the courts being dismantled or becoming idle.  But a small loyal following of enthusiasts keeps the game alive in about 25 club and private courts.  In the United States the game was thought to have first been played in 1876 when Hollis Hunnewell and Nathaniel Thayer, who had played the game in England, brought an English professional, Ted Hunt, home with them from Oxford.  They built a court in Buckingham Street in the Back Bay section of Boston and put Hunt in charge of it, assisted by the 12-year-old Tom Pettitt, who came with Hunt.  But in 1932 Malcolm Whitman, in his Tennis Origins and Mysteries, disclosed that court tennis had been played here more than 200 years earlier.  Whitman reproduced a proclamation dated 1659 by Peter Stuyvesant as governor of New York, proscribing the playing of tennis and other games during divine services on a day of fasting and prayer, October 16.  The proclamation was found in the archives of the city hall in Amsterdam, Holland.  Whitman also printed an advertisement from the New York Gazette of April 4, 1763, announcing the public auction of a house which \"had a very fine tennis court. \" There is no description of this court, and the 1876 Boston court remains the first in the U. S.  of which anything definite can be said.  There is no record of how many people played the game in America in colonial days and in the 1700s.  Probably only a few, and in the modern era since 1876 the game never has had a following of more than a few people belonging to exclusive clubs or having the privilege of playing in private courts.  Following the opening of the court in Boston in 1876, the next one in the U. S.  was built in 1880 at the Newport Casino in Rhode Island, where the first championship of the U. S.  National Lawn Tennis Association was also held, a year later.  A second court was built in Boston in 1888 at the Boston Athletic Association.  In New York, the Racquet Court Club, opened in 1876, merged in the Racquet and Tennis Club and moved.  It added a court tennis court in its new quarters in 1891 and a second 13 years later.  In 1918 the club moved again into its present quarters at 370 Park Avenue and built two new courts, one of which, the East Court, is the most famous in the country.  The game was introduced in Chicago in 1893.  In 1900 the Tuxedo Club in Tuxedo Park, New York, opened a court.  The same year George Gould, the financier, built a private court on his estate at Lakewood, New Jersey.  It was here that his son, Jay Gould, at the age of 12, was taught the game by Frank Forester, an English professional.  Gould reigned as amateur champion of the U. S.  from 1906 through 1925, and in 1914 defeated G.  F.  Covey, an English professional, in a challenge match for the world open championship, the first amateur ever to win a title match.  In 1902 a court was opened at the Myopia Hunt Club at Hamilton, Massachusetts, and a semi-private court, sponsored by William C.  Whitney, was opened in Aiken, South Carolina.  A third Boston court was built in 1904.  Philadelphia, one of the leading centers of the game today, was not introduced to court tennis until 1907.  The next year Harvard became the only American university to have a court.  It was operated by private owners for the use of students.  A third private court was built in 1909, on the estate of Clarence H.  Mackay in Roslyn, Long Island.  Surpassing the Mackay court and all others in its appointments was the one Payne Whitney opened in 1915 on his Greentree estate in Manhasset, Long Island.  In 1923 a new court was opened at the Chicago Racquet Club, and it was not until 1997 that the next new court was built and opened at The Regency Sport and Health Club in suburban Washington, D. C.  The courts now in use number ten - two at the Racquet and Tennis Club in New York, one each at the Philadelphia Racquet Club, The Boston Tennis and Racquet Club, The Tuxedo Club, The National Tennis Court at the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island, (restored in 1980) the new court at the Regency Club near Washington, D. C. , and two private courts - The Georgian Court in Lakewood, New Jersey, (restored in 1982) and Greentree, the Whitney court owned by Mrs.  John Hay Whitney.  The U. S.  amateur court tennis championship was started in 1892 and was won by Richard D.  Sears (winner also of the first championship in lawn tennis in 1881).  The great U. S.  amateur court tennis players, in addition to Gould, have been Alastair B.  Martin, Northrop Knox, Ogden Phipps, George H.  (Pete) Bostwick Jr. , James Bostwick, and James H.  Van Alen.  Gould, Knox, and the Bostwick brothers have also ruled as world champions, Jimmy Bostwick being the current title holder since dethroning his brother in 1972.  Tom Pettitt was the first player from this country to win the world crown, and the Frenchman, Etchebaster, has lived in the U. S.  since he won the title in 1928.  He resigned as champion in 1954.  The world championship is determined not by a regular tournament, but by challenge of the reigning titleist.  The game in the United States is directed by the U. S.  Court Tennis Association, organized in 1955 \"to act as a central coordinating authority between the member clubs and all amateur and professional players, so as to foster and promote the game of court tennis. \" William L.  (Sammy) Van Alen of Philadelphia was president from the associations founding until 1971, when he retired.  He had been winner of the U. S.  doubles title in 1940 with his brother, James H.  Van Alen, who was thrice U. S.  singles champion and was also president of the National Lawn Tennis Hall of Fame.  In 1971, William Van Alen was succeeded as association president by John E.  Slater, who had played lawn tennis at the Longwood Cricket Club and squash racquets at the Union Boat Club in Boston after being on the Cornell tennis team as an undergraduate.  \"New converts are coming to the sport regularly,\" Slater has said.  \"Mostly from squash, but once someone whos tried racquets or squash or lawn tennis has tried this, hes hooked.  This is as challenging as trying to go to the Masters for a golfer. \" Mr.  Slater resigned in 1988 and for the past ten years the USCTA president has been Edward J.  Hughes of Bedminster, New Jersey.  Hughes, a former college basketball player and lawn tennis professional, had been told of the game by his father, but first played the game of court tennis at the restored court at Newport in 1981.  While court tennis goes back more than three centuries in this country, its offspring lawn tennis only celebrated its centennial in 1974.  The game was unveiled in Wales in December 1873 and patented under the name of \"Sphairistike,\" or lawn tennis, by Maj.  Walter C.  Wingfield.  British officers brought the game to Bermuda, where an American, Mary Ewing Outerbridge, acquired a set including a net, racquets, and balls.  Her brother, who was secretary of the Staten Island Cricket and Baseball Club, got permission for her to set up the hourglass-shaped court of that day at the club in 1874.  The court has, of course, since become rectangular in shape.  By the 1920s the U. S.  had produced the player generally ranked as the greatest of all time, William T.  Tilden 2nd.  (Tilden was one of only three men to win the U. S.  singles title seven times; the other two were the first champion, Richard Sears, and William Larned.  Today lawn tennis is played across the U. S.  and in a hundred nations of the world, and has been undergoing a phenomenal growth since the sanctioning in 1968 of open tournaments in which amateurs can compete with professionals.  But for all the present-day popularity of lawn tennis, it has yet to develop the legends that attach to its parent, court tennis.  Not only was tennis the sport of Wellington and of Napoleon and scores of French and British kings, but it figures as well in the history and literature of Europe.  Court tennis was played in the court at Versailles where in 1789 the deputies of the Tiers Etat took the famous Serment du Jeu de Paume, or Tennis Court Oath, never to abandon their efforts until they had given a constitution to France.  Shakespeare mentioned the game in six of his plays.  In Henry V, the kings answer to the French Dauphins slight in sending him a ton of tennis balls is the most quoted reference.  Chaucer, Erasmus, Edmund Spenser, Rabelais, Pepys, Gower, Chapman, Rousseau, Ben Jonson, John Locke, Montaigne, and Galsworthy are among the men of letters who made mention of tennis.  Frances Louis X was reported to have died in 1316 from a chill contracted while playing tennis.  Englands Henry VIII, one of the keenest players among the monarchs, had an elegant blue and black velvet jacket that made his reddish hair all the more vivid.  The story is that he was playing tennis when Ann Boleyn went to the block in the Tower of London.  In 1767, the French Royal Academy of Science adopted a formal description of the game and a statement declared it \"the only game which can rank in the list of arts and crafts. \" A writer in the London Spectator in 1912 declared of the sport, \"It is not only the sum of ball games.  It is the absolute in games.  No one, it is probable, has yet sounded the depths of court tennis, and players of the greatest genius cannot master its fine potentialities. \" The above article was originally published by the Cornell Alumni News in April of 1974.

It may even now be too late to get your hands on a copy, which is a pity: the book has done my sense of wonder a world of good.  I had only an inkling that there was such a sport as court tennis, much less that Benvenuto Cellini played it, that a 19th-century pro named Louis won a match carrying a donkey on his back, that the floor the game is played on is marked with 34 horizontal lines or that these lines have names like \"One and Two,\" \"Half a Yard Worse Than Last Gallery\" and \"The Door. \" I would be content to enjoy all this on the level of fantasy, but one doesn't have to.  In an appendix to this book Bill Talbert says that neither Ruth nor Grange nor Dempsey \"ruled his sport with the greatness or the dominance of Pierre Etchebaster. \" That is Pierre, the book's author, who seems to have been world court tennis champion for 26 years, retiring undefeated in 1954 at the age of 61.  He still plays and teaches, and his way of commending a student's shot, we are told, is to drop his own racket, throw up both hands and exclaim, \"This is what I am! This is what I am!\" Pierre is said to retain a strong Basque accent after 42 years in this country as the New York Racquet and Tennis Club's court tennis pro.  He certainly writes with a flair for the curious expression--for example, \"Do not abuse for the dedans. \" (\"In attacking a chase of a yard or better,\" he notes earlier, however, \"it is preferable to abuse for the dedans. \") And yet this book not only convinces the reader that there is such a game as court tennis, it even gives him a good solid glimmer of how it is played.  Suffice it here to say that the racket is warped-looking, the ball is made of cloth and the court has sloping roofs, or \"penthouses,\" jutting out on three sides, and an abutment, the \"tambour,\" obtruding obliquely into one corner.  The dedans is one of three openings in the walls which you can win a point by hitting the ball into.  Questions do remain: How would Pierre have fared against the earlier masters Allison Danzig mentions: \"Gould, with his killing length of 'better than a half and deadly railroad service, or. . . Latham with his. . . terrible boasted forces\"? How did Louis ever get a donkey to stay on his back? Would this be called abusing for the donkey? How do you tell the dancer from dedans? There are only a few hundred court tennis players now active, I gather, and they all belong to clubs I don't belong to.  But I am going to keep Pierre's Book by me anyway, to look into when life grows stale.

Etchebaster started as a player of pelota, the game of his native Basque region, before taking up real tennis, the ancestor of lawn tennis known in France as jeu de paume.  By 1926 he was a challenger for the world championship, which he won in 1928 against previous champion George F.  Covey of the U. K.

A vaudeville performer, she sang the original versions of well known songs such as \"La Violetera\" and \"El relicario\", both written by Jose Padilla Sanchez. Meller was born in Tarazona (Zaragoza), Aragon in the neighborhood of Cinto.  Her father, Telesforo Marques Ibanez, worked as a blacksmith and her mother, Isabel Lopez Sainz, ran a grocery store. Her family was one of the oldest in Aragon and were quite wealthy before becoming impoverished during the Carlist Wars.  At the age of four, her family moved to Barcelona.  Her father died when she was not yet 10 years old and she was placed under the care of her aunt, Sister Maria del Carmen, an abbess in the convent at Figueras. When her aunt asked her to become a nun, she escaped from the convent with the help of a gardener's ladder. She moved back to Barcelona, where she worked as a seamstress, embroidering the robes of priests and bishops. She sang as she worked, eventually drawing crowds who would stand on the street outside of the dressmaker's shop.  Aged 13, she sang at a small cabaret in Valencia. She later appeared in Madrid where she attracted the attention of the King and Queen of Spain.  Around that time she met a famous singer, Marta Oliver, a regular at the clothes shop. Under the tutelage of Oliver, the young chanteuse made her debut in the lounge La Gran Pena in February 1908 under the name La Bella Rachel. [citation needed] Subsequently, she changed her name to Raquel Meller.  On 16 September 1911 she made her grand debut at the Teatro Arnau in Barcelona. [citation needed] In 1917, she met the Guatemalan journalist and diplomat Enrique Gomez Carrillo, whom she married in 1919. As Meller was unable to bear children, the couple adopted.  The same year, Meller held her first concerts in Paris (Olympia), Argentina, Uruguay and Chile.  Meller secured a divorce from Carrillo in 1922. In 1919, Meller appeared in her first film, Los arlequines de seda y oro.  In the next few years, she would star in her most successful and silent films Violettes imperiales (1924) and Carmen (1926).  She quickly became popular throughout the Western world and was a darling of the media.  Meller was known to wear slender gold bracelets on her right wrist, each representing a significant step in her stage career. Spanish senator Emilio Junoy alleged that Meller betrayed the spy Mata Hari to the French police in an apparent fit of jealousy over her husband Gomez Carrillo, who had penned a biography of Mata Hari.  He denied the rumor, pointing out that Mata Hari was executed in 1917, two years before he married Meller. The Russian outfit Films Albatros conceived of the 1926 film Carmen as a star vehicle for Meller, whose portrayal of the main character was a great success despite being at odds with the vision of director Jacques Feyder. Though she rose to fame singing bawdy cuples, Meller was known to be prudish.  Feyder later recalled how Meller's attitude led to problems while filming: One morning, in the famous stone bullring of Ronda, pearl of Andalusia, we argued over a kiss she thought inappropriate just when we were about to shoot.  Maybe because I felt for the 600 walk-ons waiting under a leaden sun, or maybe it was the sun's effect on me, unusually for me I raised my voice.  She raised her arms to the sky, her bracelets tinkling, and cried out: \"I don't give a fig about this Mr.  Merimee; anyway, where does he live, this Merimee? I'll phone him!\" Time magazine.  Meller appeared on the 26 April 1926 cover ofmagazine.  Meller was twice booked to perform in the United States, but canceled both appearances.  In 1926 she finally arrived under contract to theatrical producer E.  Ray Goetz, who assured her appearance by requiring her to put up a bond of $100,000.  Meller arrived via the SS Leviathan, on which she attempted to book a deluxe suite for her five Pekingese. She visited New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, Boston, Baltimore and Los Angeles.  The sight and sound of Meller were captured for the Fox Movietone sound system, first demonstrated to the public at the Sam H.  Harris Theatre in New York City on 21 January 1927.  The clip, not quite synchronized, was shown by a movie projector equipped to play sound-on-film, and preceded the feature film What Price Glory? originally released by Fox in November 1926. On her 1926 visit to Los Angeles, Meller attracted the attention of Charlie Chaplin, who tried to secure her to costar with him.  Though he was unsuccessful, Chaplin did incorporate the melody of the song \"La Violetera\" as a major theme in his 1931 film City Lights. Violettes imperiales.  Raquel Meller as Violetta in the 1932 version of In 1932 Meller shot a second version of Violettes imperiales for the talkies, and in 1936 began shooting Lola Triana, whose production was interrupted by the Spanish Civil War.  In the 1930s Meller lived in France.  She was friends with Maurice Chevalier and Sarah Bernhardt, who described Meller as the \"greatest actress in Europe--after myself. \" In 1937 Meller traveled to Argentina where she remained until 1939.  After the Civil War she moved to Barcelona and again achieved popularity with the play of Jose Padilla's Violetera, and there remarried to French businessman Edmond Saiac. Meller faded from public view after the late 1930s.  Her legend was rekindled with the films The Last Torch Song (1957) and The Violet Seller (1958) starring Sara Montiel, who sang songs popularized by Meller.  Other notable \"Queens of cuple\" were La Chelito and La Fornarina. In 1962, Meller suffered a heart attack and died a month later on 26 July after falling into a coma, aged 74.  Her funeral procession in Barcelona the following day numbered 100,000 people. She is interred in the Montjuic Cemetery in Barcelona. Meller's hometown of Tarazona houses a permanent museum exhibition for Meller in the Fine Arts Theater of the town hall.

Raquel Meller, << la Reina del couple >> or the paradox of a star singer pushed into the limelight of silent films.  Raquel Meller was born Francisca Marques Lopez in 1888 at Tarazona in Spain.  A leading singer of the early XXth century, Marta Oliver, discovers her talent and decides to make it known to the public.  At time, << La Belle Otero >> is setting Paris society on fire.  Called << La Bella Rachel >>, Francisca makes her first appearance on stage in 1908.  Her success entices her to opt for an artistic career and she changes her name into Raquel Meller.  In 1911, she appears Barcelona.  She sings << El Relicaro >> and << La Violetera >>.  Both tunes will soon become international hits, opening her way to tremendous fame.  In 1917, she falls in love with Enrique Gomez Carillo, a writer and a diplomat from Guatemala ; she marries him and mixes with European intelligentsia.  Her husband, both Oscar Wilde and Verlaines friend, is known for breaking womens hearts : one them is no less than the spy Mata Hari herself.  Raquels career keeps blooming and she triumps at << LOlympia >> in Paris.  Meanwhile, she starts acting in two silent films shot by Carlos Banos : << LArlequin de Soie et dOr >> and << La Gitane Blanche >>.  her beauty, her talents on stage and on screen being recognized, she sets off on a tour in Latin America, which she conquers.  In 1922, she divorces and meets French filmmaker Henry Roussel who hires her for << Les Opprimes >>, then << Violettes Imperiales >> in 1923, and in 1925 : << The Promised Land >> with French actor Pierre Blanchar.  All three films are blockbusters.  And, paradoxically, owing to the magic of movies, they make a silent film star of a star singer.  Her film carreer develops and in 1926, the French/Belgium director of that time, Jacques Feyder, establishes her as an actress in the leading part of << Carmen >>, another silent film.  Apparently, the shooting is made difficult because of the actresss whims.  On that year, she sets off on a second tour.  This time, the states are calling her : New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Baltimore and Los Angeles give her triumphant welcome.  Even Charlie Chaplin requests her participation to his next production : << Limelight >>.  somehow, the project fails.  However, Raquel Meller plays in several musical and, at last, talking short films, made in Hollywood.  After her resounding stay in the USA, she is back in Europe at the height of her fame, in the early thirties.  She, then, dwells in her villa at Villefranche Sur Mer.  In order to win back the French audience, she records some hits of the time, and she makes a triumphant comeback at << LAlcazar >> in Marseille.  Her popularity, then, is on a par with Maurice Chevalier and Mistinguetts.  A biography of << La Reina del couple >> is published in 1931 and the Spanish painter Sorella portrays her.  Henry Roussel asks her to play in the sound version of << Violettes Imperiales >> in which she performs both as a singer and an actress.  Her film, << Lola Triana >>, starts in 1936 but its shooting is soon interrupted by the Spanish Civil War.  She flees to Argentina and gets back to Spain when Franco, whom she greatly admires, has won.  After getting married again and soon divorced, she chooses to live on her own in Barcelona.  Her loneliness will go along with the erosion of her fame.  At the end of the fifties, Raquel Meller attempts a comeback on stage in Madrid when her hour of glory hits are brought up to date by << usurping >> Sara Montiel.  She fails.  She retires in Barcelona, falls ill and dies in 1962.  Even though places are named after her in Villefranche and a statue represents her in Barcelona, her fame has been erased in the collective memory, even in Spain.  Rise an fall, . . .  such is the fate of a star who aroused passion in Europe and the Two Americas audiences. . . "}}

He was named Bishop of Modena in 1529 and was created Cardinal in 1542 by Pope Paul III.  As a cardinal, he resided in the Vatican's Apostolic Palace and was consulted by Saint Ignatius, founder of the Jesuits. Early life and ordination  Stemma of Cardinal Morone Morone was born in Milan, on 25 January 1509, where his father, Count Girolamo Morone (d.  1529), was grand chancellor. His father, who had been imprisoned for opposing encroachments on the liberties of Milan by Charles V (whom he afterwards cordially supported), removed to Modena, where his youngest son had most of his early education.  Proceeding to Padua he studied jurisprudence with distinction.  In return for important service rendered by his father, he was, on 7 April 1529, at the age of 20, nominated by Pope Clement VII to the see of Modena as a demonstration of gratitude. His father Girolamo had been one of the commissioners who negotiated the terms of the release of the Pope from imprisonment in the Castel St.  Angelo in 1527 during the Sack of Rome.  Giovanni was seven years too young to be consecrated a bishop, and in any event his appointment was disputed by the future Cardinal Ippolito II d'Este, son of the Duke of Ferrara, who claimed that the Pope had promised the See of Modena and a Cardinalate for him in a treaty of 14 November 1528. D'Este was finally bought off with an annual pension.  Giovanni Morone was finally ordained priest and consecrated bishop on 12 January 1533. From 1535 he was repeatedly entrusted by Pope Paul III with diplomatic missions; first, he went with a mission to France to King Francis I to attempt to arrange a peace with the Emperor; then he was sent as nuncio in 1536 to the Emperor's brother, King Ferdinand I, then in 1539-1540 to Hagenau and Worms in an attempt to reclaim those areas for the Catholic Church. Morone was legate to the Diet of Speyer (1542) having successfully resisted the transfer of the diet to Hagenau on account of the plague (1540).  On 31 May 1542 he was created Cardinal Priest, and on 16 October 1542 assigned the titulus of San Vitale. He was further nominated protector of England, Hungary, Austria, of the Order of St.  Benedict, the Cistercian Order and the Order of Preachers (Dominicans), and of the Santa Casa at Loreto. With the cardinals Pier Paolo Parisio and Reginald Pole he was deputed to open the Council of Trent (1 November 1542 - 6 July 1543), the choice of that place of meeting having been a concession to his diplomacy.  The legates arrived on 22 November, but no council assembled; proceedings were suspended and postponed until 1545.  He was appointed instead to be Papal Legate to Bologna, from 2 April 1544 to 13 July 1548.  His vice-Legate was Giannangelo de' Medici, who became Pope Pius IV.  On 25 February 1549, he opted for the Cardinalatial titulus of San Stefano in Monte Celio (San Stefano Rotondo). The death of Paul III on 10 November 1549, deprived him of a good friend.  He participated in the Conclave of 1549, where his friend and fellow President of the Council of Trent, Reginald Pole, came close to being elected pope. The views of the Reformers had spread in his diocese, and he was suspected of temporizing with them.  He resigned (1550) in favor of the Dominican Egidio Foscherari, reserving to himself an annual pension and the patronage of livings.  Later, he founded the diocesan seminary.  On 11 December 1553, he opted for the titulus of San Lorenzo in Lucina, which meant a greater income.  Pope Julius III, at the instance of the Duke of Milan, gave him the rich see of Novara (which he resigned in 1560 for the Suburbicarian See of Albano) and sent him as nuncio to the diet of Augsburg (1555), from which he was immediately recalled by the death of Julius III (23 March 1555).  He participated in the Conclave of 5-10 April 1555, which saw the election of Cardinal Marcello Cervini as Pope Marcellus II. However Marcellus died after only twenty-two days in office.  A second Conclave in May, on the nomination of Cardinal Alessandro Farnese and Cardinal Ippolito d' Este, elected (23 May) the Dean of the College of Cardinals, Cardinal Gianpietro Carafa, the Grand Inquisitor of the Roman Inquisition.  This was much to the distaste of the Emperor, who was aware of Carafa's deep hatred of the Spanish and his religious fanaticism. Morone opted for the titulus of Santa Maria in Trastevere on 12 June 1556. But on 31 May 1557, on direct orders of Pope Paul IV, carried out by his nephew, Cardinal Carlo Carafa, Morone was imprisoned in the Castel Sant'Angelo (with others, including Bishop Egidio Foscherari), on suspicion of the Lutheran heresy. The College of Cardinals, led by their Dean, Cardinal du Bellay, demanded a Consistory the next day, and the Pope was forced to explain himself.  He stated that there had been questions about the orthodoxy of Cardinal Morone since the time of Paul III, and he also attacked Cardinal Pole.  He insisted that Morone remain in the hands of the Inquisition for a future time when all the Cardinals would be summoned to judge his case. A commission of Cardinals was appointed to conduct the interrogations, among whom was Cardinal Michele Ghislieri (the future Pope Pius V), Cardinal Scipione Rebiba, Cardinal Giovanni Reuman Suau, and Cardinal Alessandro Farnese. The prosecution entirely failed, the Cardinals having found no grounds for any of the charges.  Morone might have had his liberty, and the Suburbicarian Bishopric of Albano, but refused to leave prison unless Paul IV publicly acknowledged his innocence.  Paul IV, a former Inquisitor who believed that the Inquisition was never wrong, refused to admit his error, and therefore Morone remained incarcerated until the pope's death (18 August 1559).  It is believed that Paul IV published his Cum ex apostolatus officio to prevent Cardinal Morone from being elected the next Pope because he suspected Morone of secretly being in league with Protestants. As events turned out, Cardinal Giovanni Angelo de' Medici was elected, and took the name Pope Pius IV. Morone did have the great pleasure of making the acquaintance of Cardinal Carlo Borromeo at that Conclave, and Borromeo conceived a very high opinion of Morone's virtues.  Upon the election of Pius IV, Morone's name was cleared publicly, and he accepted the office of Cardinal Bishop of Albano, which he exchanged for that of Sabina in 1561, then Palestrina in 1562, and Porto and Santa Rufina in 1565.  In 1564 he had the pleasure of receiving back from Pius IV the diocese of Modena, upon the decease of the incumbent, and he held the post until 1571.  In 1566 he was a candidate at the Conclave summoned to elect a successor to Pius IV.  He had the support of the Emperor and the Spanish, and was supported by Cardinal Carlo Borromeo; but the French faction and some of the Italian princes (Ferrara and Florence) were able to exclude him from the Papal Throne. Cardinal Ghislieri declared that he had reconsidered Morone's case and could not in conscience elect him, though he did not impose that judgment upon the other cardinals. Nonetheless, Morone received as many as twenty-nine votes in the scrutinies, a majority, but not the two-thirds majority (35) needed to elect.  Ghislieri himself was ultimately elected unanimously and took the name of Pope Pius V. He became Dean of the Sacred College of Cardinals in 1570, and assumed the Bishopric of Ostia and Velletri which went with the Deanship.  In that capacity he presided over the Conclave of 1572, which elected Ugo Boncompagni as Pope Gregory XIII. As Cardinal Bishop of Ostia and Velletri, he was attentive to the implementation of the decrees of the Council of Trent, especially as regards the holding of regular diocesan synods.  On 3 June 1573, a Synod took place under his authority in the Diocese of Veletri, with his Suffragan bishop, Lorenzo Bernardini, presiding.  In October 1579, the Cardinal Bishop himself presided.  The original Acta are preserved, with his handwriting and seal on them. Morone continued to explore issues within the Church and between Catholics and Protestants in hopes of reuniting the two sides.  He commissioned Nicholas Sander to research the progress of Protestantism in England, resulting in the publication of the Report on the State of England in 1560.  In 1562, Morone assisted Pius IV in restarting the Council of Trent, earning a reputation as a skilled mediator and, in hindsight, \"the savior of the council. \" He served as its last chair under Pius IV and helped the Council to create the Tridentine Creed.  When the festival of the Jubilee of 1575 began in Rome, Cardinal Morone presided over the ceremony of the opening of the Holy Door, through which hordes of pilgrims passed, at the Basilica of San Paolo Fuori le Mura on the Via Ostiensis.  In 1575, likewise he was invited to join a legation which included Matteo Senarega, a minister of the Emperor and a minister of the King of Spain, to visit Genoa, which had fallen into complete disorder because of civil strife. Morone was able to bring peace to the troubled city with a new civic constitution, the major part of which was written by Morone.  Next year he was asked to attend the Diet at Ratisbon, in the presence of the Emperor Maximilian II, and his very presence had the effect of calming the participants.  In 1578 he was sent to Flanders to restore peace there, but (as might have been expected) he was unable to achieve his goal. He died on 1 December 1580, and was buried in the Basilica of Santa Maria sopra Minerva, the headquarters of the Dominicans, whose Protector he was.", "article_1": "He is a physiatrist.

Morone was named bishop of Modena in 1529.  In 1536 Pope Paul III sent him as ambassador to Germany, where he encouraged theological discussions while working toward a general council that would bring peace to Christian countries and would appease Catholics and Protestants.  He assisted at the German diets of Hagenau (1540), Ratisbon (now Regensburg; 1541), and Speyer (1542), where he succeeded in getting Trento accepted as the locality of the council which Paul III convoked for Nov.  1, 1542.  He returned to Rome in 1542 and was made cardinal.  He was appointed as Pauls emissary to the Council of Trent, but when the council was postponed (until 1545), Paul made Morone governor of Bologna in 1544.  Under Pope Julius III, Morone became bishop of Novara (1553-60).  In 1557 Pope Paul IV imprisoned him at Rome on suspicion of heresy, but he was released on Pauls death (1559) and was absolved by Pius IV, who in 1563 appointed Morone president of the Council of Trent.  Morones diplomacy saved the council from disaster when a large international body of bishops pressed for a statement that episcopal jurisdiction came to each bishop directly from God and not through the pope.  Opposition by the Roman delegation resulted in a deadlock.  Morone secured the surrender of the extremists on both sides, and the council finally accepted the statement that bishops were assigned by the Holy Ghost to rule the church.  Thus he brought the councils last period to a successful conclusion.  Morone was made bishop of Ostia in 1570 and spent his last years administering the English College in Rome in his capacity as cardinal protector of England.

He belonged to a distinguished Milanese family, raised to the nobility in the twelfth century.  His father held the dignity of chancellor of Milan, and it was probably to bind the father to his interest that Clement VII in 1529 named his son Giovanni, then only twenty years of age, to the See of Modena.  By this appointment great offence was given to Cardinal Ippolito d'Este, who on the pretext that the See of Modena had previously been promised to himself, invoked the aid of Duke Alfonso of Ferrara and took forcible possession of the see, appropriating all its revenues.  The dispute was not settled until 1532, when Morone at last bought off the opposition of d'Este by agreeing to pay him an annual pension of 400 ducats.  Even as early as 1529, the young bishop-elect, whose talents had already attracted attention at the University of Padua, was chosen by Clement VII for a diplomatic mission to France.  Under Paul III Morone's gifts as a negotiator placed him at once in the very front rank of ecclesiastical politicians.  He was sent as papal envoy to Duke Sforza of Milan in 1535, and in the following year accepted, not altogether without reluctance, the important mission of nuncio at the court of Ferdinand, King of the Romans.  His instructions were to press on the affair of the council in Hungary and Bohemia.  He was to obtain from Ferdinand a safe-conduct for those who intended to take part in it, and to insist upon Mantua or some other Italian city as the place of meeting.  With the exception of an interval from September, 1538 to July, 1539, and another in 1541, Morone remained at his post in Germany for nearly six years, and he was present at the diets of Hagenau in 1540 and Ratisbon in 1541, while at the important meeting of Spiers in 1542 he appeared as the pope's special representative, and played a leading part, though even his great tact and resolution were able to do little in the complicated tangle of German religious affairs.  During these early years in Germany, and indeed throughout his life, Morone remained a conspicuous member of a little group of moderate and intellectual men who saw that in the deadly struggle with Lutheranism, the faults were not all on one side.  When Cardinal Sadoleto in 1537 for addressing a courteously worded appeal to Melanchthon was denounced by many of his own side as little better than a traitor and a heretic, Morone wrote the cardinal a letter of sympathy.  \"There are in these parts\", he said, \"many reputed defenders of the Catholic faith who think that our religion consists in nothing but hatred of the Lutherans .  .  .  .  and they are so wedded to this point of view that, without ever looking into the matter itself, they take in bad part not only all negotiations with the Lutherans, but every single word spoken about them which is not abusive\".  Morone further advises Sadoleto to treat his critics with silent contempt, and states his own conviction that to show charity to heretics was a better way than to overwhelm them with abusive language, adding: \"if only this course had been adopted from the first, there would probably be less difficulty than there is in bringing about the union of the Church\" (see the letter in \"Archiv f.  Reformationsgeschichte\", 1904, I, 80-81).  On 22 May, 1542, Paul III published his Bull, which had been drafted by Sadoleto, summoning the council to meet at Trent, on 1 Nov. , of the same year.  On 2 June, Morone was created a cardinal, and on 16 Oct. , he and Cardinals Parisio and Pole were named legates to preside over the assembly as the pope's representatives.  But this first attempt to launch the long-desired council was a failure.  Morone went to Trent and waited until the handful of representatives, who never met in public session, gradually dispersed, the council being formally prorogued 6 July, 1543.  Before the assembly was again convened Morone was named legate (practically papal governor) at Bologna, and he had nothing to do with the sessions of the council which took place at Trent between December, 1545 and June, 1546, though after the council had been ostensibly transferred to Bologna, he was named by Julius III as one of the commissioners to arrange for its return to Trent.  In 1555 he was sent to the Diet of Augsburg, but the death of Julius necessitated his recall and under the Pontificate of Paul IV Morone, who owing to his wide and liberal views had the misfortune to awaken the pope's suspicions when the latter presided over the Roman Inquisition, was arrested by the pontiff's order, confined in the Castle of Saint Angelo (31 May, 1557), and made the object of a formal prosecution for heresy, in which his views on justification, the invocation of saints, the veneration of relics and other matters were incriminated and submitted to rigid inquiry.  The cardinal strenuously repudiated these charges, but he was kept in confinement until the death of Paul IV.  In 1560 his successor Pius IV authorized a revision of the process against Morone, and as a result the imprisonment of the cardinal and the whole procedure against him were declared to be entirely without justification; the judgment also recorded in the most formal terms that not the least suspicion rested upon his orthodoxy.  A few years later when the cardinal legates Gonzaga and Seripando died at Trent, Morone and Cardinal Navagero were appointed to succeed them, and the former eventually presided over the concluding sessions of the council with conspicuous tact and dignity.  He was also placed upon the commission appointed to see that the conciliar decrees were duly carried into execution.  Under the succeeding pontiffs his credit was in no way impaired.  He was sent on a mission to Genoa in 1575, and in 1576 was appointed to attend the Diet of Ratisbon as papal legate.  As Cardinal Protector of England, Morone in 1578-1579 had much to do with the administration of the English College (see Catholic Record Society, \"Miscellanea\", II, London, 1906); and when he died he had been for some time Cardinal Bishop of Ostia.  Few ecclesiastics in that century were so successful in retaining the esteem of men of all parties and all creeds as this large-minded and eminently able and honest churchman.  His reports as nuncio, recently published of late years in the German series of \"Nuntiaturberichten\", throw a flood of light upon the religious conditions of the empire, and it is interesting to note that the \"Claudius internuntius\" whose letters were so often turned to good account by Raynaldi proves to be no other than Morone himself (see Ehses in \"Romische Quartalschrift\", 1903).  It may be mentioned in conclusion that Morone had much to do with the founding of the important Collegium Germanicum in Rome, a work in which he was closely associated with St.  Ignatius Loyola.

The most interesting and satisfactory materials for Morone's life are to be found in his own despatches and in the prefaces contributed by his editors: see Friedensburg, Nuntiaturberichten aus Deutschland, part I, II (Gotha, 1892); Dittrich, Quellen und Forschungen auf d.  Gebiete der Geschichte, I (Paderborn, 1892); Idem in Historisches Jahrbuch, IV (Bonn, 1883); Lammer, Monumenta Vaticana (Freiburg, 1901); Merkle, Concil.  Trident.

", "article_4": "Background: The problem of the relationship between ethics and robotics is very broad, has important implications, and has two large areas of impact: the first is conduct in research, development, and use in general.  The second is the implication of the programming of machine ethics.  Purpose: Develop and administer a survey of professionals in the health domain collection of their positions on ethics in rehabilitation and assistance robotics.  Methods: An electronic survey was designed using Microsoft Forms and submitted to 155 professionals in the health domain (age between 23 and 64 years; 78 males, mean age 43. 7, minimum age 24, maximum age 64; 77 females, mean age 44. 3, minimum age 23, maximum age 64) using social media.  Results and discussion: The outcome returned: (a) the position on ethics training during university studies and in the world of work, (b) the organizational aspects hindered by ethics and those to be perfected in relation to ethics, (c) issues of ethical concern, (d) structured feedback on the usefulness of the methodology along with considerations of open text.  Conclusions: An electronic survey methodology has allowed the structured collection of information on positions towards ethics in this sector.  Encouraging feedback from the participants suggests the continuation of the study is beneficial.  A continuation is expected, expanding the audience of professionals involved and perfecting the survey with the support of scientific companies.  View Full-Text"}}

For example, his biographical article in wikipedia states: Petit also envisages that the US Army would have accidentally discovered how to generate antimatter through superdense states of matter by the use of magnetically focused underground thermonuclear explosions of several megatons.  Some antimatter bombs would have been created, but too powerful to be tested on Earth they would have been camouflaged into what was known as the comet Shoemaker-Levy 9, then detonated on Jupiter.  Most of his colleagues judge this story as fancy.  In fact, Jean-Pierre Petit wrote and published on his website an article in which he examined the nature of the object Shoemaker-Levy 9, which he thinks is not a comet.  In it he also examines the strange hypothesis stated above (\"hypothesis of document SL9\"), which did not originate with him and which was first stated in an anonymous document published on the Internet, and subsquently much discussed on the web.  The conclusions of Jean-Pierre Petit are the following (I translate word for word): The most likely hypothesis seems therefore to be that of an asteroid of the C1 carbonated chondrite type, the comet hypothesis must be eliminated, as for the hypothesis of document SL9, it is inconsistent with the presence of silicates, of numerous metals and with the absence of baryum, despite the fact that all the calculations of masses are coherent.  The only point which remains to be elucidated is its non-detection until March 1993, only pictures taken of Jupiter during the months of July/August 1992 would permit a definitive answer to this question.  The article on Shoemaker-Levy in French (part 1)", "article_2": "In June 2018, the top level journal Astrophysics and Space Science published an article validating twelve observational confirmations of Jean-Pierre Petit's cosmological model JANUS, which up to now has been strenuously ignored by the scientific community.  Q-MAG. org has on several occasions presented Jean-Pierre Petit's work to its readers.  Another scientific article by Jean-Pierre Petit is presently in the process of being reviewed.  In this article, he exposes his interpretation of fluctuations in the background of primordial radiation, the CMB.  His analysis allows him to conclude that in this negative sector the speed of light is multiplied by ten and the distances are 100 times shorter (making interstellar travel possible).  In the words of Jean-Pierre Petit, now 81 years old: \"Rather than continuing to present my work in the manner of popular science, I now prefer to return to the front of peer-reviewed publications, where papers are analyzed by \"referees. \" Indeed, the combat of science is played on the field, not in the locker-rooms.  This is a rule which I have always respected. \" \"I have the feeling that the edifice of cosmology, of astrophysics, is a vast house of cards which is on the verge of collapsing.

He was second in command of the La Perouse expedition, which departed France on 1 August 1785 and was eventually lost in the Pacific.  Fleuriot de Langle died in an encounter with natives in what is now American Samoa before the expedition was lost; his remains were returned to France, and were buried in the choir of the church of Saint-Louis at Brest. In 1771, aged only 27, Fleuriot de Langle was admitted as a member of the Academie de Marine.  He was promoted to Lieutenant in 1778.  Fleuriot de Langle took part in the American Revolutionary War.  In April 1781, Fleuriot de Langle was given command of the 32-gun frigate Resolue.  From March 1782, he commanded the 50-gun Experiment, and then commanded the frigate Astree in the Hudson Bay expedition under La Perouse's orders.  For Fleuriot de Langle's expertise, knowledge of math and astronomy, and force of character, La Perouse chose him as his deputy for his next expedition, commanding the 114-man frigate Astrolabe (accompanied by the Boussole) on a voyage of exploration into the Pacific Ocean.  On the return voyage in 1787, fearing scurvy among his crew, Langle and La Perouse landed on the Samoan island of Maouna to look for drinking water and fresh food, which they were running out of (Langle and La Perouse both recognised the importance of fresh food in fighting scurvy, and - unlike La Perouse - was persuaded by the observations of Captain Cook that fresh water was also valuable in this regard).  With their boats laden with water barrels, they waited for a tide high enough to rejoin their ship, but, according to the survivors' accounts, they were in the meantime faced with ravishing young women, their hair decorated with hibiscus, advancing across the beach towards them and offering them sex.  After many weeks at sea, these advances were evidently not unanimously rebuffed and extreme confusion and disorder followed.  To convince the indigenous chiefs to re-establish order, and to divert the ladies' attention, Fleuriot de Langle offered the women several trivial objects, and they retired in good order.  The exchange of gifts and the inevitable comparisons that followed created jealousies and only boosted the tensions.  Soon 7 to 8 thousand hostile natives encircled the boats and the casks and prevented the French from re-embarking, but Langle refused to fire on them since the French king's orders had been to keep the mission peaceful.  Hit on the head by a stone, he fell into the water, dead, and his sailors opened fire.  In the ensuing massacre, 12 sailors were killed and 20 wounded and finished off with club blows. Death of Langle, as depicted in 1846 Fleuriot de Langle was posthumously promoted to Chef de Division on 24 April 1788.  La Perouse said of Langle that \"He died for his humanity\" and \"I have lost by the most horrific of treasons my best friend, my friend for thirty years.  A man full of spirit, judgement, knowledge, and certainly one of the best officers in all the fleets of Europe\".  His remains were buried in the choir of the church of Saint-Louis at Brest.  Paul-Antoine Fleuriot de Langle is featured on a Monument to the Dead on the site on the island of Tutuila in American Samoa, inscribed \"Inaugure en 1883 pour honorer la memoire de onze membres de l'expedition Laperouse massacres en ce lieu. \" (inaugurated in 1883 to honour the memory of de Langle and the 11 other members of the Laperouse expedition massacred on this site).  In 1999, an archaeological expedition to Vanikoro in 1999 dived on the wrecks of Boussole and Astrolabe, and found a silver fork with the coat of arms of Fleuriot de Langle.

Commercially and critically successful, though neither mainstream nor avant-garde, Jessua is a maverick whose work, like that of the great American maverick director Samuel Fuller, explores controversial subjects in a bold, cinematic style.  However, unlike Fuller, his career has yet to receive the kind of reassessment and serious study it deserves, and, as a result, his compelling and highly-original films, which include La Vie a Lenvers (Life Upside Down, 1964), Jeu de massacre (The Killing Game, 1967), Traitement du choc (Shock Treatment, 1973), Les Chiens (The Dogs, 1979) and Paradis pour tous (Paradise For All, 1982), are rarely screened and largely unavailable on English-subtitled DVD.  Recently Monsieur Jessua kindly agreed to the following rare and exclusive interview with newwavefilm. com in which he talks about his remarkable life in cinema.  >> Read Alain Jessua's biography.  Can you tell me about your early years? I was born in Paris.  World War II had a strong presence throughout my childhood since I was seven at the onset of the war and eleven when Paris was liberated.  I come from a Jewish family so we had to flee and hide during the occupation.  We stayed with friends who saved our lives.  Did you have an interest in the cinema as a child? Yes, when I was little some of my friends had small film projectors and we used to watch silent films like Metropolis (1927).  It was my first initiation to cinema.  At what point did you decide to become a filmmaker yourself? After the war, one of my friends and I - he was the nephew of film director Julien Duvivier - would sneak on to Duviviers film sets and watch him and his crew at work.  Thats when I decided to become a filmmaker.  To me, the film studios were factories manufacturing dreams.  I loved the smells on set and the atmosphere really fascinated me.  Did you go to film school? When I finished school I had the option of either going to film school, which werent well regarded at the time, or starting work experience on film sets.  I choose the latter.  You worked for Jacques Becker and Max Ophuls as an assistant.  What did you learn from them? Casque d'Or (1952) The first film I worked on was Casque dOr (1952) by Jacques Becker.  I was seventh assistant, meaning that I did all the menial work, but I learnt a lot through observation.  In fact, thats how I learnt to be of a film director; I learnt on the job.  It was amazing to experience Beckers passion for cinema.  He loved his art but worked really slowly.  He had been working on Casque dOr for ten years and the producers threatened to withdraw funding if he did not speed things up, so it was interesting to see him come to grips with this financial pressure.  The way Becker directed actors was very different from the way Ophuls directed them.  Becker was very detail-oriented and loved playing with the actors intonation.  He would make them say the same line with ten different intonations resulting in ten different meanings.  I was very lucky to be given the opportunity to become Max Ophuls second assistant on Madame de. . .  (1953).  Max Ophulss way of directing was rather distinctive: before shooting a scene, the actors would rehearse on set without the rest of the film crew, which was a very modern way of doing things.  Working on the film, I was able to follow all the final stages of production, including dubbing and editing, which was an amazing experience.  Cinema was very hierarchical then; it was almost like being in the army.  I was fortunate Becker and Ophuls were very open-minded.  They liked sharing ideas with assistants and worked closely with them.  My films are at loggerheads with Ophulss but he remains the strongest influence on my work.  The tramp Leon Boudeville and a young Alain Jessua, 1956 Your first short film was Leon la Lune (1956) about a day and night in the life of a tramp.  Can you tell me how the film came about? One day, while I was on set doing some assistant work, it suddenly occurred to me that I was becoming a film technician and that was not my goal when I started working in cinema.  That was my wakeup call.  Thats when I decided to make a short film.  It so happened that I was in a severe car crash, while working on an Yves Allegret film (Mam'zelle Nitouche, 1954), and I was immobilized for a while.  Luckily I had subscribed to a life insurance a couple of days before the accident so I used the compensation to fund my first short film.  Leon la Lunes story is based on the real lives of tramps at the time.  Some of them chose to live on the margins of society and in loneliness; it was a lifestyle.  You collaborated with the poet Robert Giraud on the film - what was it like to work with him? Robert Giraud was a specialist of the unusual Paris.  He lived at night and he actually introduced me to the tramp starring in the film.  He was a real fountain of knowledge when it came to the Parisian underbelly.  The film won the Prix Jean Vigo in 1957.  It must have given you quite a lot of confidence to win an award for your first film.  Yes to a certain extent but not exactly.  Filmmaking has never been an easy process for me.  I have never felt I should rest on my laurels.  In fact, I was not able to make another short film after Leon la Lune.  What the film gave me though, was the possibility to dedicate more time to scriptwriting.  I still did some work for the likes of Marcel Carne but with the success of Leon la Lune and funding from the Malraux legislation (1962) that supported filmmakers I was able to write my first feature length film.  There were seven years between Leon La Lune and your first full-length film.  In that time the Nouvelle Vague came to prominence.  Did you feel part of the movement or separate from it? Prior to the Nouvelle Vague, you needed more than ten years of experience as an assistant to contemplate the prospect of directing a full-length film.  Most first time film directors were in their forties so French cinema was starting to feel rather arthritic.  Since the Nouvelle Vague filmmakers were usually 25 to 30 years old, people came to realize younger film directors were perfectly able to make good films with smaller budgets and more freedom.  I never really felt part of the Nouvelle Vague.  I befriended some of its prominent proponents but I never identified with the movement.  I think its most important contribution to cinema was the revolution in film editing that Jean Luc Godard brought about.  Thanks to him people realized that all the cinematographic language that had been enforced up to that point could be completely shattered.  There was no need to show everything to your audience, no need for fade-in and fade-out or clear-cut transition.  You could show a couple having dinner in one scene and in bed in the next; the audience is clever enough to bridge the transition for themselves.  Godard completely changed cinematographic grammar.  After Breathless (1960) came out, all kinds of other filmmakers, such as Rene Clement with Plein Soleil (1960), embraced his elliptical editing technique.  Charles Denner in La Vie a lEnvers, 1964 Your first feature film La Vie a lEnvers is still one of your best-known and most popular films.  Can you describe the circumstances that led to the making of the film and what inspired you to write the screenplay? I love suspense films so I wanted to make one.  I optioned the rights of a novel by Robert Simon telling the story of man with multiple identities but that fell through.  So my only option was to make an indoor suspense film, thats how I wrote the screenplay of La Vie a lEnvers.  The screenplay has now been turned into a book and the film is screened in medical schools in France and in psychiatric institutes in Chicago to illustrate schizophrenia.  The main character is an outwardly successful person who rejects his life and chooses instead to live a life of solitary contemplation, but everyone else thinks him mad.  It seems deliberately ambiguous as to whether he is or not.  Was that your intention? Yes, right from the start.  Thats what I find really fascinating with psychosis.  The line between normal and abnormal is very fine indeed.  When I started writing the film, I paid a visit to a psychiatrist friend who told me we all have the potential to become neurotic or psychotic.  He recommended searching in myself to find inspiration for my character.  With La Vie a lEnvers I was interested in showing the ambiguity between normal and abnormal.  You said in another interview: \"The everyday bores me.  For me a hero is someone who is different\" - in La Vie a lEnvers the lead character is example of this.  Is there something about characters most people would consider mad or delusional you identify with? Absolutely, I identified with the protagonist.  I do not mean to sound immodest but I think thats the strength of great playwrights, filmmakers, and novelists.  Flaubert used to say: \"Madame Bovary its me\". . .  that says it all.  What was it like to direct your first full-feature film? Was it what you expected it to be? Its one thing to learn technique but there comes at time when one has to face the demands and restrictions of the creative process.  You realize you have to fight against the film technicians conformism.  Thats something I felt really early on.  At the time, films where in black and white, with very contrasting lights and lots of shadows, and I wanted to make a film in grey and white with almost no shadows.  It took me a long time to find a head cameraman who would agree to shoot in grey and white - people thought I was mad.  I think its the same with theatre companies, when you want to create an original production you have to fight against conformism.  Michel Duchaussoy in Jeu de Massacre (1967) Your next film, Jeu de Massacre, was stylistically quite different; its in colour and the pace is faster and more dynamic.  Did you consciously change your method of directing for this film? Jeu de Massacre was a completely different learning experience from La Vie a lEnvers.  At first I wanted to make the film in black and white but the co-producer insisted it should be in colour.  In the end this worked in the films favour, as I was inspired to recreate the look of comic books.  Unfortunately there was not enough of a budget to transform the image exactly as I wanted it - I could not create blue grass and red sky, which is possible with digital technology today - but the trick was to work with filters to try and make scenes inspired by comics more colourful.  Like many of your films it has a memorable soundtrack - how did that come about? The comic featured in the film, created by Guy Peellaert, was inspired by Pop Art so I needed a soundtrack to mirror Peellaerts style.  We found an English pop band (The Alan Brown Set) whose music matched the comic perfectly.  The film was quite a success, winning you the award for best screenplay at Cannes.  Youve written or co-written most the films you made.  Why did you choose to make films from your own stories rather than adapt books? Actually I now believe I should have tried to find inspiration in someone elses work more.  Ive been a novelist for the past ten years and I feel I always have the same obsessions.  I think finding inspiration in someone elses work is essential to renew ones style.  There are also commercial reasons: its easier to pitch a film to a producer if its already been published as a book; it gives you something concrete to work with.  Your next project was La Planete Bleue, a science fiction screenplay you wrote that Carlo Ponti was interested in producing.  Can you tell us about this project and why it never went into production? After Jeu de Massacre I wanted to make my dream film so I wrote La Planete Bleue.  I wanted to cast Julie Christie as the lead but the project was aborted.  It was a really harsh experience for me.  For a year or so I lived like a luxury tramp, producers took me to Rome, London and New York for endless meetings but the film never came about.  There came a point when Id had enough.  I felt that even if the film had gone ahead, it would have been a bad one because I was already too emotional invested in it.  I also tried to secure financing for the film in Hollywood but It was a case of bad timing.  The American film industry at that time was producing an increasing number of independent films with smaller budgets and La Planete Bleue would have been really expensive with lots of special effects.  There are worse things in life, but this was probably the most distressing film experience I ever had.  Traitement de Choc was inspired by your own experiences of a health clinic wasnt it? Alain Delon and Anna Girardot in Traitement de Choc, 1973 Yes, after La Planete Bleue I was really exhausted so I spent a week in thalassotherapy.  While I was there I had the idea of turning the experience into a horror film set in health clinic.  Its quite a damning attack on the rich who exploit others to enhance their own standard of living.  Do you think a film should have a moral point? Whatever the film there is always a moral point, whether its made consciously or not.  All of my films illustrate a moral except En Toute Innocence (1988), where I wanted to tell a simple story with good actors.  But that was quite unusual for me.  I find it difficult to write a film without a moral stance.  Traitement de Choc incorporates a lot of black humour, which is a great way to make your point, while also entertaining your audience.  The film starred two of Frances then biggest actors: Alain Delon and Annie Girardot.  How was it working with them? It was fantastic.  They were both really professional and open-minded actors so everything went smoothly.  Actors cant stand it when they feel technique is more important to the film director than their own interpretation of their character.  Its really important to respect the artistry of an actor and to establish a good working relationship with them.  Thats when miracles occur.  Thats when actors will give you the best of their art - when they give it all.  As a film director, you need to get to this point where you reach a complete understanding with the actor.  This is something I experienced with Patrick Dewaere on Paradis Pour Tous (1982).  It was a beautiful experience.  Your next film was Armaguedon (1977), which was an adaptation of the novel The Voice of Armegeddon by David Lippincott.  What drew you to the story? I read the book and I became fascinated by it and wanted to adapt it.  I wanted to create a critique of voyeurism, of our society where life feels more and more like a reality TV show.  Things have become very sensationalized and there no longer seems to be any difference between public life and private life.  Thats what I denounce in the film.  Les Chiens (1979) shows how a breakdown of law and order inspires an even fiercer clampdown when residents of a suburb begin acquiring attack dogs to guard them.  This looks even more relevant now than it was in the 1970s with ever increasing levels of violence and urban paranoia.  What gave you the idea for the film? I was recording the music for Armaguedon in Milan and I noticed that in the evenings there were dogs on leashes outside cafes.  I was told the elderly took their dogs with them to protect them against potential muggers, so I simply pushed reality further.  Gerard Depardieu in Les Chiens (1979) How was the film received at the time? No one believed in the film then; people thought it was unrealistic.  Years later the violence showed in the film became reality.  In France there were lots of accidents with people who had acquired attack dogs to protect them.  It was a premonitory film if you like.  Despite the fascist overtones of his ideology I must admit if found Depardieus character, the dog trainer, quite sympathetic.  Thats great; thats exactly what I set out to do.  I want to make my audience empathize and somehow identify with my characters, whether theyre heroes or villains.  Everyone is attracted to power to a certain extent and I think thats why the audience is drawn to Depardieus character.  There are some gripping scenes of confrontation between people and dogs.  Were they difficult to shoot? Yes, shooting with dogs is challenging.  The world of dog training is dangerous; dog owners tend to be rather deranged and they pass their aggressiveness on to their dogs.  The canines are trained to bite, attack, hurt and aggressive behaviour is rewarded.  Its a strange world.  The owner of the main dog in the film was a man in his thirties who had left his fiancee for the dog.  The dog you see at the end of the film was a hybrid - half dog, half wolf - and its owner was covered in cuts.  The dog was really unstable and dangerous.  Patrick Dewaere in Paradis pour tous, 1982 Paradis pour tous (1982) concerns a character played by Patrick Dewaere who is cured of depression by a new method called \"flashage\", which seems like a miracle cure at first but leaves its recipients stuck in a permanent state of serene indifference.  The film, released in 1982, seems extraordinarily prescient given the modern trend for medicalizing mental and emotional problems.  It also targets consumer society and the world of business.  What inspired you to write the script? I was in California staying in a villa in Bel Air, casting actors for a film that never went into production.  On a Saturday morning I went food shopping and at the till the cashier asked me how my day was and I said not so well.  His reaction made me realize that by complaining I was breaking a social code.  On the West Coast everyone is tanned, its sunny; on the surface everyone is happy.  So I got the idea to create a film where everyone seems happy even if its a shallow and superficial form of happiness.  When Patrick Dewaere told me he wanted to be in the film I was delighted but I knew I would have to fight to see the film through to the end.  His role is really difficult because his character is always happy but Dewaere had to show different nuances of happiness.  His acting had to be extremely subtle but he nailed it.  We got on really well and by the end of the shoot we did not even need to speak to each other; he would read my mind.  How did Frankestein 90 (1984) come about? Were you a fan of the earlier versions of the story? I had to make a film because Paradis pour Tous was a really expensive and had also left me rather exhausted, so I needed a breath of fresh air.  Frankenstein 90 is more of a producers film than a directors film.  It was an entertaining experience, working with actors I really liked, but it felt more like a break.  I liked the earlier versions of the story and I really enjoy horror films, so it was a really pleasurable and refreshing experience.  Unexpectedly, the film was a triumph in India.  Michel Serrault and Nathalie Baye in En Toute Innocence (1988) En Toute Innocence (1988), starring Nathalie Baye and Michel Serrault, is a comedy/thriller in the Hitchcockian style.  Had you always wanted to make film of this type? Yes, I wanted to show I could make a thriller but without an overarching moral.  The film is indeed Hitchcockian, with the action set behind closed doors and this psychological war going on between a man and his stepdaughter.  I thought Michel Serraults performance was outstanding and the story really appealed to the public.  When you were directing films did you like to improvise on set or did you prefer to storyboard every scene? I really liked having a French-style script breakdown with scenes in the left side column and sound in the right side column and precise descriptions.  Having said that, for really important scenes, I would always rehearse with actors and often the content would change.  The storyboard was a reassuring aide-memoire to work from.  If I were making films now I would have a completely different way of directing - with digital cameras I would improvise much more since one can shoot films more quickly.  Your last film, Les Couleurs du Diable (1997), is about a painter who makes a Faustian pact to become famous and successful.  Can you tell us more about it? The film was a rather bizarre and disappointing experience.  I am not happy with it at all.  I really liked the novel but these types of fantasy novels are really difficult to shoot in France.  I was only able to shoot the film in Italy.  I lacked funding and some special effects to make certain scenes really spectacular.  The head cameraman, who had worked with Visconti, had really high expectations but my vision for the film was limited by our budget.  Although I do have really fond memories of being on set and working with the Italian film technicians who are really passionate about what they do, I am really dissatisfied with the film itself.  Since the release of Les Couleurs du Diable in 1997, you have focused on writing novels.  How does novel writing differ from scriptwriting for you? When you write a script your style is very elliptical; there is no need to describe the mindset of characters as you know the actors will be able to convey their emotions.  Novel writing is a much more in depth writing process.  Film directors often adapt novels because the novelist gives them more material to work with than just an original screenplay.  The novelist usually spends a couple of years perfecting a novel and thats whats missing with an original screenplay: it lacks depth.  How do you feel about the current state of film industry? Armaguedon, 1977 Unquestionably there is an unprecedented pressure to make a film a commercial success and as a result a lot of interesting films are not even released in cinemas.  Its getting easier and easier materially speaking to make films and more and more difficult to distribute them.  Thats exactly the problem encountered by French cinema at the moment: more than 300 French films are made every year and only 60 or so are shown in cinemas.  Its the same with literature: fewer publishers are willing to take risks and the majority prefers publishing books in a genre that has already proven commercially successful.  Its very paradoxical.  What would you say are some of the main themes and ideas you have tried to convey with your films and writing? I am deeply interested in finding the uncanny in the ordinary: that little something unusual that occurs when reality is slightly shifted and seeing what would happen as a result.  In that sense, some of my films are premonitory.  I cant make cinema that is too realistic.  The poetic realism of pre-World War II French cinema expressed the mentality of the people at the time.  It idealized French society and the way people perceived it.  The dream was more telling about reality than a realistic film would have been.  Thats what Im interesting in.  I like films that open up a different door onto reality and show a new world.

His later films include the Cannes-award-winning Jeu de Massacre (The Killing Game, 1967), Traitment du Choc (Shock Treatment, 1973), Les Chiens (The Dogs, 1979) and Paradis pour tous (Paradise For All, 1982).  Though relatively unknown today, his work is amongst the most imaginative and thought-provoking of its time.  Top 10 Films by Lesser Known Directors || French New Wave History || French New Wave Film Guide see also articles on: Dir.  Alain Jessua BIOGRAPHY Early Life Born in Paris in 1932 to a Jewish family, Alain Jessua spent World War II in hiding, an experience that left him with a lifelong sympathy with the plight of the outsider.  He became fascinated by cinema and from a young age decided that he would become a filmmaker himself.  After school he gained a valuable apprenticeship working as an assistant to directors Jacques Becker and Max Ophuls, from whom he learnt techniques that he would later use throughout his own career.  In 1956, funded by a compensation pay-out following a car accident, he directed his first film: a short documentary about a day and night in the life of a tramp in the poetic realist style called Leon la lune (Leon the Moon).  It earned him immediate recognition, winning the prestigious Prix Jean Vigo in 1957 and garnering the praise of the poet and screenwriter Jacques Prevert.  Still only in his early twenties, Jessuas career seemed set on a glittering course.  La Vie a lenvers In fact seven years would pass before Alain Jessua made his next film.  In that time the Nouvelle Vague came to prominence, making it possible for an unprecedented number of unknown directors to break into the industry.  Though he never felt closely affiliated with the movement, Jessua was of the same generation as its leading figures and shared with them a passion for cinema and an uncompromising determination to follow his own path.  Most of those who followed in the New Waves wake would soon be forgotten, but the brilliance of Jessuas first feature-length film, La Vie a lenvers (Life Upside Down, 1964), was immediately apparent.  This quietly terrifying \"indoor suspense film\", tells the story of Jacques, a young estate agent played by Charles Denner, who asks himself the question that has preoccupied thinkers for centuries: What is the purpose of life? His answer is to turn his back on his outwardly successful existence and withdraw into a life of solitary contemplation.  Is he inspired or mad or simply self-indulgent? Jessua leaves us to make up our own minds while drawing us subjectively into Jacquess increasingly surreal perception of the world around him.  Inevitably his behaviour alienates those around him and he loses his job, his friends, his new wife, and is finally locked up in an insane asylum.  \"Ive won,\" he chuckles to himself, happy to have exchanged his freedom for the opportunity to spend his days contemplating the blank walls of his hospital room.  La Vie a lenvers won Jessua the Award for Best First Work at the 1964 Venice Film Festival and established him as a writer/director with an original cinematic vision as distinctive as any of his contemporaries.  Jeu de massacre Jessua took his examination of madness to another level in his next film: Jeu de massacre (The Killing Game, 1967).  This time the unbalanced mind belongs to a wealthy playboy called Bob (Michel Duchaussoy), whose desire to escape his sheltered life and emulate the exploits of his fictional heroes is fulfilled when he persuades Pierre and Jacqueline (Jean-Pierre Cassel and Claudine Auger), the creators of his favourite comic, to stay at his house and turn him into the hero of their newest adventure.  When Bob identifies a little too closely with his alter ego and starts acting the stories out, he draws his house-guests ever deeper into his dangerous delusions.  Faster-paced than Life Upside Down and shot in the vivid Pop Art colours of the comic strip created for the film by celebrated artist Guy Peelart, Jeu de massacre encapsulated the spirit of the 1960s in the characters of the idealistic/delusional Bob and the hedonistic/ cynical Pierre.  Its qualities were recognised at the 1967 Cannes Film Festival where Jessua won the award for Best Original Screenplay, after which it went on to become a considerable box office hit in France.  Le Planet Bleu Buoyed by success, Jessua began work on his dream project: a science-fiction film called Le Planet Bleu.  The scale of the ambitious production required the backing of a producer with considerable clout, so when Carlo Ponti, the famous Italian producer behind numerous high-profile movies including Godards Les Mepris (Contempt, 1963) and David Leans Dr Zhivago (1965), showed an interest in the screenplay, it seemed like there was every chance it would go into production.  This lead to what Jessua later described as his \"living like a tramp in the lap of luxury for three years in London, Rome and New York\" as Ponti funded development but failed to commit the large amount of money needed to make the film.  Finally, realising that Ponti was lying to him, Jessua relocated to Los Angeles and tried to find financing for the film there, but now the New Hollywood era of low-budget, American-themed movies like Easy Rider was in full swing and the studios had scant interest in gambling on a big-budget science-fiction movie by an unproven European director.  Disheartened, Jessua returned to France and checked himself into one of the then fashionable thelassotherapy (seawater therapy) spas in the hope of restoring his spirits.  It was here that he first conceived of the idea for his next film.  Traitment du choc Set in an exclusive health clinic whose rich clientele are there for rejuvenation treatments to make them feel and look younger, Traitement du choc (Shock Treatment, 1973) starred Alain Delon and Anne Girardot - then two of Frances biggest stars - as Doctor Devilers, the charismatic head of the establishment, and Helene, a fashion designer who has come to the clinic feeling \"old\" after being ditched by her lover for a younger woman.  At first pleased when the treatments apparently work, and seduced by the doctors charms, Helene soon becomes disturbed by the mysterious suicide of her closest friend and the disappearance of some of the young Portuguese men working at the spa.  Intent on investigating, she stumbles upon the terrible truth in the doctors laboratory.  Treading a fine line between suspense thriller and social satire, Traitement du choc today seems astonishingly prescient given the modern obsession with looking and feeling young at all costs.  Its portrayal of a bourgeoisie ready to turn a blind eye to the exploitation of others as long as it suits their own selfish ends is as disturbing as anything cooked up by Bunuel or Chabrol.  Jessua handles the genre elements with a deft hand: drawing us into the seductive lifestyle of the inhabitants of the resort and building suspense until the final horrifying climax.  Characteristically, theres no reassuring resolution, as Helene discovers the fate of those who dare to take on the clinic and its clientele of the powerful elite.  Armaguedon Traitement du choc was the first of four tautly plotted dramas Jessua made over a ten-year-period which drew on contemporary anxieties in the guise of what might be described as \"cautionary tales\".  Armaguedon (1977), adapted from the novel The Voice of Armageddon by David Lippincot, again starred Alain Delon, this time as a police psychologist hunting down a terrorist operating under the pseudonym of \"Armaguedon\".  Jean Yanne gives a powerful and moving performance as the one-man revolutionary Carrier, a nobody with meglomaniacal tendencies whose craving for recognition leads him down a desperate path.  Although it occasionally gets bogged down in the not-entirely-plausible Interpol investigation, and Delon seems one-dimensional in the role of the psychiatrist (Michel Duchaussoy who plays the police inspector would have been a better, if less commercial, choice for the role), Armaguedon is a compelling and ultimately sympathetic study of alienation in modern society.  The behaviour of the crowd during the climactic showdown - a suspense set-piece worthy of Hitchcock - only serves to underline everything Carrier has said in his broadcast about human nature, as the people laugh at his manifesto then trample each other to death in their rush to save their own skins.  Les Chiens Equally pessimistic in its view of human nature, Jessuas next film Les Chiens (The Dogs, 1979) occupies a similar conceptual and physical terrain as the stories British science-fiction author JG Ballard was writing at this time.  Set in a bleakly modern provincial town where a series of unsolved attacks are spreading a climate of fear amongst the populace, it stars Gerard Depardieu as Morel, a dog-trainer with a philosophy of self-empowerment bordering on the Nietzschean, who appears to have the answer to the towns problem.  Tense and confrontational, the film very effectively shows how easily a stratified community can turn to fascism out of panic.  Yet, remarkably, Jessua succeeds in drawing our sympathies for both sides in the hostility and introduces a ray of hope in the shape of a community of African refugees whose good humour and simple enjoyment of music offer some kind of alternative to the entrenched resentment felt elsewhere.  Inevitably though violence leads to more violence and Morel ends up reaping the consequences of his ruthless ideology.  Paradis pour tous The final and most ambitious of this loose quadrilogy, Paradis pour tous (Paradise For All, 1982), seems, at first, lighter in tone than its predecessors, though events in the story quickly take a disturbing turn.  Patrick Dewear, an exceptional actor who tragically died soon after the film was made, plays Alain, a suicidal insurance agent who is cured of his depression by \"flasage\" - a new therapy invented by Dr Valois (Jacques Dutronc) - that aims to make people feel permanently happy.  Unfortunately it also makes Alain completely indifferent to others pain and suffering.  Always smiling, always serene, Alain and his fellow guinea pigs are a success in their new lives, although their lack of empathy damages their personal relationships.  Alains wife Jeanne (Fanny Cottencon) is particularly disturbed by her husbands dispassion about everything.  Yet rather than attempt to reverse the process, Dr Valois decides the only answer is to \"flasage\" both Jeanne and himself.  Inspired by Jessuas time living in Los Angeles, Paradise for All is a darkly comic, sometimes grotesque, satire that brilliantly targets the unhealthy desire people have to be happy all the time, even when that desire robs them of their humanity.  Later work In his next two films Jessua took a step back from the moral complexity of his earlier work into the realm of pure genre entertainment.  Frankenstein 90 (1984) was a comedy update of the horror classic featuring Jean Rochefort as Victor, a direct descendent of the original Baron Frankenstein, who assembles body parts to create a new kind of human being.  His creation, Frank, played with genuine pathos by rock and roll star turned actor Eddy Mitchell, means well but his desire for a mate leads to murder and mob reprisals.  Following this, Jessua made En toute innocence (No Harm Intended, 1988) a psychological suspense thriller set in a country estate near Bordeaux, starring Michel Serrault as a wealthy architect who catches his daughter-in-law (Nathalie Baye) in an act of adultery immediately before crashing his car.  He is left with broken legs and an apparent loss of speech.  An escalating cat-and-mouse battle of wills then ensues as the two vie for dominance over the household.  Serrault and Baye are, as you might expect, a pleasure to watch as they attempt to outmanoeuvre each other, revealing as they do so the resentment and disillusionment concealed beneath the calm exterior of bourgeois life.  Almost a decade passed before Jessua made Les Couleurs du Diable (The Colors of the Devil, 1997), a modern retelling of the Faust legend in which a young painter, Nicolas (Wadeck Stanczak), accepts the help of a mysterious stranger, Bellisle (Ruggero Raimondi), who promises to provide him with the inspiration that will bring him success.  In his case this means bringing him face to face with real life experiences of death; a tactic that works as Nicolass morbid paintings of what he has seen attract a following and bring him great success.  Sadly, despite its promising premise, Les Couleurs du Diable proved a frustrating experience for Jessua who felt he did not have the budget he needed to make the most of the material.  Following its failure, he gave up filmmaking.  In the years since he has instead turned his storytelling skills to the writing of novels whose titles include Crevecoeur (1999), Ce sourire-la (2003), Bref sejour parmi les hommes (2006), La Vie a lenvers (2007) - a novelisation of the film, Un jardin au paradis (2008) and Petit ange (2011).  Personal Life Alain Jessua was married for some years to the actress Anna Gaylor who appeared in a number of his films.  They had one child.  He died in Paris on the 30th November 2017 at the age of 85.  FILMOGRAPHY Need suggestions? See our list of the Top 10 Films.

A regional source aligned with Damascus told Reuters that Hakan Fidan, head of Turkey's National Intelligence Organization (MIT), and Syrian intelligence chief Ali Mamlouk met as recently as this week in the Syrian capital.  The contacts reflect a Russian policy shift as Moscow steels itself for a protracted conflict in Ukraine and seeks to secure its position in Syria, where its forces have supported President Bashar al-Assad since 2015, according to two Turkish officials and the regional source.  Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters. com Register Any normalisation between Ankara and Damascus would reshape the decade-long Syrian war.  Turkish backing has been vital to sustaining Syrian rebels in their last major territorial foothold in the northwest, after Assad defeated the insurgency across the rest of the country, aided by Russia and Iran.  But rapprochement faces big complications, including the fate of rebel fighters and millions of civilians, many of whom fled to the northwest to escape Assad's rule.  Turkey, a NATO member country, has troops on the ground across the area, deemed occupying forces by Assad.  During the meetings, Fidan - one of President Tayyip Erdogan's closest confidants - and Mamlouk evaluated how the two countries' foreign ministers could eventually meet, according to a senior Turkish official and a Turkish security source.  \"Russia wants Syria and Turkey to overcome their problems and achieve certain agreements. . . which are in the interest of everyone, both Turkey and Syria,\" said the Turkish official.  One big challenge is Turkey's desire to include Syrian rebels in any talks with Damascus, the official added.  RUSSIAN SHIFT The Turkish security official said Russia has gradually withdrawn some military resources from Syria in order to focus on Ukraine, and had asked Turkey to normalise relations with Assad to \"accelerate a political solution\" in Syria.  The Damascus-allied source said Russia had nudged Syria to enter talks as Moscow seeks to nail down its position and that of Assad in the event it must redeploy forces to Ukraine.  Russia has sustained stunning losses on the ground in Ukraine over the past week.  The most recent meetings - including a two-day visit by Fidan to Damascus at the end of August - had sought to lay the ground for sessions at a higher level, the source said.  The senior Turkish official said Ankara does not want to see Iranian or Iran-backed forces - already widely deployed in government-controlled parts of Syria - plugging gaps left by Russian withdrawals.  The Turkish security official said neither did Russia want to see Iranian influence expand as it reduces its presence.  A diplomat based in the region said Russia had pulled a limited number of troops out of Syria's south earlier this summer, particularly in areas along the border with Israel that were later filled by Iran-aligned forces.  While Fidan and Mamlouk have spoken intermittently over the last two years, the pace and timing of recent meetings suggests a new urgency to the contacts.  The regional source allied to Damascus and a second senior pro-Assad source in the Middle East said the Turkish-Syrian contacts had made a lot of progress, without giving details.  A third regional source aligned with Damascus said Turkish-Syrian relations had begun to thaw and were advancing to a stage of \"creating a climate for understanding\".  The sources spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the contacts, which have not been publicly disclosed.  The Russian foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Turkey's MIT declined to comment and the foreign ministry did not immediately comment.  The Syrian information ministry did not immediately reply to emailed questions from Reuters.  UNTHINKABLE BECOMES THINKABLE Turkish-Syrian rapprochement seemed unthinkable earlier in the Syrian conflict, which spiralled out of an uprising against Assad in 2011, killing hundreds of thousands of people, drawing in numerous foreign powers, and splintering the country.  Erdogan has called Assad a terrorist and said there could be no peace in Syria with him in office, while Assad has called Erdogan a thief for \"stealing\" Syrian land.  But in an apparent change of tone last month, Erdogan said he could never rule out dialogue and diplomacy with Syria.  read more Erdogan faces tight elections next year in which a key issue will be repatriating some of the 3. 7 million Syrian refugees now in Turkey.  read more The Turkish-Syrian contacts come against the backdrop of a flurry of meetings between Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin, including one planned on Friday in Uzbekistan.  In July, Turkey helped seal a U. N. -backed deal that lifted a blockade on grain exports from Ukraine's Black Sea ports which had prevailed since Russia's Feb.  24 invasion of its neighbour.

Some have interpreted the move as a sign of a major split in the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) and beginning of an alliance with Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, while some others insist that despite the resignation, ties between Erdogan, Davutolgu and Fidan are as robust as ever.  The intention here is not to discuss why Fidan resigned, but to give a technical analysis of what it may mean.

His colleagues at Bilkent University told Al-Monitor that as a student, Fidan was quiet, disciplined and fully committed to his studies.  He should not be expected to deliver fiery speeches to AKP voters during the election campaign.  Fidan, who served as a noncommissioned officer in the Turkish army for 15 years, wrote his masters thesis on a comparative study of the Turkish, US, British and Russian intelligence systems and his Ph. D.  dissertation on the effects of information systems on diplomacy and foreign policy.  The common thread was gradual institutional change, which Fidan later became known for implementing.  An academic in Ankara who knew Fidan well but requested not to be named said he stood out by engineering smooth changes in massive organizations such as the Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency and then at MIT.  Many now feel that after the elections, Fidan will be tasked with redesigning Turkeys entire security apparatus.  What do the military leaders, the former rulers of the land, think about this? Almost all of them have strong positive feelings about their former colleague.  According to a senior military official who spoke to Al-Monitor on condition of anonymity recalled how Fidan played a significant role in shaping the coordination and cooperation between the top military and civilian cadres after 2011 and creating an atmosphere of mutual trust.  The military, of course, will have further expectations from Fidan in the new phase.  Fidans mission will be to manage the change in Turkeys security structure, a task he couldnt have taken on as a bureaucrat in charge of MIT because such a mission needs an elected official at its head, ideally a minister.  Fidan is expected to change Turkeys security apparatus with a new ministry to be called the \"Ministry of National Security. \" This idea is nothing new.  Before he ended his tenure, former President Abdullah Gul prepared the \"Presidential Defense Reform Report,\" which was later adopted by the new president.  Its message was clear: Security services in Turkey are too fragmented and redundant.  Coordination among security agencies is feeble and security elements are not trained and experienced enough to cope with newly developing threats and risks.  Fidan may be expected to cure this issue by redesigning the countrys security structure.  As a first step, the security functions of the Prime Ministry, and those of the ministries of Defense, Interior, Foreign Affairs, Industry and Customs will be consolidated under the roof of the new ministry.  The ministries of Interior and Defense will not be eliminated, but their mandates will be narrowed and most of their functions will be transferred to the new ministry.  The National Security Ministry will supervise the coordinated operations of Turkeys military, MIT, police, cybersecurity and other security departments.  There are studies in progress examining the security systems of advanced countries.  The project's results are expected to be put into use after the 2015 elections.  Who will be the new head of MIT? There can't be many people who would like to take Fidans place as MIT head.  Columnist Ertugrul Ozkok wrote in Hurriyet Feb.  14 that the MIT head will always be the first to be affected by the negative consequences of Turkeys Syria policy.  Ozkok wrote, \"Fidan is escaping from something.  He wants to distance himself from a danger and doesnt want to be held responsible for it. \" According to Ozkok, Fidan is fleeing Turkeys Syrian policy, which is \"no longer shaped by logic but by emotions. \" Ozkok says Fidan has left MIT because he knows that this wrong policy could get him into trouble with international law.  Who, then, will it be? For now, Ismail Hakki Musa is running the organization as acting undersecretary.  The decision will be made by Erdogan and Davutoglu, who will consider the views of the military's high command.  It is, however, possible that the appointment of the new head will be delayed until after the general elections to avoid a crisis within the AKP.  The first candidate is Serdar Kilic, currently Ankaras ambassador in Washington.  This possibility gained currency in a surprising three-hour meeting Erdogan held Feb.  13 with Kilic at the Houston airport, where his plane had landed to refuel, an unannounced diversion that must have been arranged in advance.  A senior Middle East security analyst told Al-Monitor on condition of anonymity that Kilic would be a perfect choice for this post, with his intimate knowledge of the Middle East and proven activist attitude as an ambassador, especially in Lebanon.  Having served as the secretary-general of Turkey's National Security Council before his appointment as ambassador to Japan, Kilic is already familiar with Turkey's key security agencies.  A second option would be to appoint Musa, a retired ambassador, to the post.  Another name circulating for the post is Muhammed Dervisoglu, the undersecretary of Public Order and Security under the Interior Ministry.  But given the increasing involvement of his department in the solution process with the Kurds and coordinating contacts with imprisoned Kurdistan Workers Party leader Abdullah Ocalan, it is unlikely that he will return to MIT from his new post.  Turkey must soon decide whether the traditional security concept of protecting the state from the citizens or the libertarian concept of protecting citizens from the state will prevail. ", "article_3": "October 21, 2013 Turkey is just emerging from the lethargy of a 10-day-long holiday thanks to combining Eid al-Adha with weekends.  Tens of thousands of Turks went abroad or traveled inside their home country.  During the holiday, Turkeys polarized and tense political atmosphere also took a vacation despite one event after another that would have otherwise created a furor.  The cause of these developments was reporting by influential and important Western newspapers.  First, there was a news report on Oct.  10 in The Wall Street Journal by two writers who charged that Turkey had been supporting radical Islamist groups attacking the Kurds in northern Syria despite warnings by the United States.  The writers gave the impression that they had had access to what was discussed at the May 16 meeting in the White House between President Barack Obama and Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan.  The foreign ministers and intelligence chiefs from both countries participated in the meeting.  The article focused primarily on criticism of Hakan Fidan, Turkeys intelligence chief, who is known to be Erdogan's most important confidant.  The authors claimed that Fidan was privy to Iranian intelligence targeting Israel.  When the Journal published its analysis, Turkey was in a holiday mood for a holiday that had not yet begun.  Nevertheless, there were quick reactions from Turkey contending that the real target was actually Erdogan, via Fidan.  Before that dust settled, the real bombshell arrived from The Washington Post on Oct.  16.  David Ignatius, one of the most respected, veteran op-ed writers in the American press, quoted unnamed sources asserting that Turkey had warned Iran about 10 Iranians whom Israel intelligence had recruited in Turkey.  In short, Turkey was accused of selling out Israel to Iran, dealing a monumental blow to Israeli intelligence.  The International New York Times (formerly the International Herald Tribune) on Oct.  17 went with the title \"Report That Turkey Exposed Spies Strains Its Relations With Israel\" for a Jerusalem-datelined report by Isabel Kershner.  The article conveyed the views of former Mossad chief Danny Yatom, Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Zeev Elkin and an unidentified senior Israeli official about the Post report.  Here is, in part, what Yatom had to say: \"Turkey, which shares borders with Iran, Iraq and Syria, among other countries, once served as 'a convenient place for Israel to work to reach people from hostile countries, Mr.  Yatom said.  But while there had been 'outstanding cooperation in earlier years between Israel and Turkey, Israel now is 'not open with the Turks, as we were in the past, he said.  Mr.  Yatom added, 'We are suspicious of the Turks that they relay information to Iran that can endanger us. \" It is hard to gauge the resonance of Ignatius' bomb among the general public, but pro-government newspapers and writers responded immediately with return fire.  Sabah did not fail to note that Ignatius was of Armenian descent, of which many people are unaware.  Almost all the reactions recounted that Ignatius had been the moderator of the Davos panel when the Turkish prime minister and Israeli President Shimon Peres engaged in a tense exchange that entered into the Turkish political lexicon as the \"famous one-minute episode. \" That event is considered the beginning of the deterioration in Turkish-Israeli relations.  During the panel, after Peres replied to Erdogans strong criticism of Israel following its 2009 attack on Gaza, the Turkish prime minister wanted the right to reply.  Ignatius tried to avoid giving Erdogan the floor, so he could wrap up the meeting and they could all go to lunch, Erdogan grabbed Ignatius arm, and uttered, \"One minute,\" in English.  He then proceeded to deliver a stern response in Turkish before stalking off the stage in protest against Israel.  This is why there should be no surprises about enraged reactions from Turkey when such a news report is published with an Ignatius byline, especially following on the Journal report.  The perception that Fidan was treated as Erdogans Achilles' heel and that the real target had been Erdogan himself gained credence in government circles after the Post article.  Reaction was not only limited to pro-government media and writers.  Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, speaking to journalists in his hometown of Konya, alleged, \"This is black propaganda against Turkey. \" An adviser to the prime minister, in a widely printed quote, said the Journal and Ignatius articles amounted to \"psychological warfare. \" As the trauma of the Ignatius article continued to circulate, or as journalists would say, before the ink had even dried, the international, influential and reputable Financial Times reported on Oct.  17, in a front-page story by Daniel Dombey, that Turkey had given up on a number of ambitious mega projects, including the third airport for Istanbul.  The appearance of such a report on the front-page of the Times was seen as detrimental to foreign investor confidence and, combined with the other reports, deemed as adding insult to injury.  Dombey, unlike the Journal and Post writers, is a well-known name and has been living in Turkey for a long time.  He has never had a report for the Times denied or challenged.  This time, however, he couldnt shield himself from the wrath of the ruling quarters.  Dombey did not appear to be repentant, as on Oct.  20, his article titled \"Doubts Rise Over Turkeys Ties to the West\" appeared online at FT. com.  He led off with the question \"Has Turkey, a member of NATO for 61 years, parted company with the west? It is a question Turkeys allies have begun to face. \" Dombey then elaborated on the background of recent debates: \"Three issues have converged to create the doubt: Ankaras decision to buy a Chinese missile defense system; its alleged ambivalence towards al-Qaeda-affiliated fighters in Syria; and, most recently, allegations that Turkey betrayed Iranians spying for Israel to Tehran. \" He concluded by providing Turkey the benefit of the doubt: \"The way Turkey has responded to these three controversies: its insistence that the missile purchase is not a done deal, its condemnation of jihadists and its fulminations at the allegations of collusion with Iran all indicate a country that values its Western alliances.  But with these ties now in question, it will be actions, not words that count. \" These reports, coming as they did, one after the other, act as self-serving prophecy for the conspiracy theorists who believe the Western powers, led by Israel, are scheming to oust Erdogan from power and are stepping up their efforts as the 2014 elections approach.  These theorists, Erdogan among them, of course, had opted to explain the two weeks in June that shook Turkey to the core as a plot to prepare the ground for a military coup or a scheme of the \"foreign interest rate lobby\" and so on.  Among them was a manager of a television channel who seriously asserted that Erdogan would be assassinated through telekinesis and voiced the fantastic claim that Germany and Lufthansa were behind events in Istanbul because they feared the Frankfurt airport losing its hub status with the construction of the third Istanbul airport.  He was rewarded shortly thereafter with an appointment as \"head adviser\" to the prime minister.  Two weeks after the brutal suppression of events in Istanbul's Gezi Park, Gen.  Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, in a military coup, removed the Egyptian government led by the Muslim Brotherhood, which Erdogan strongly supported.  This was enough for many sane people to see the growing collection of nonsensical claims as self-fulfilling prophecy.  The articles in The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post and Financial Times constitute a second wave.  This time, the counterclaims are not as absurd as the ones about who and what was behind the Gezi protests.  It is certain, nonetheless, that they will also serve as self-fulfilling prophecy for the Turkish government.  Cengiz Candar is a columnist for Al-Monitor's Turkey Pulse.  A journalist since 1976, he is the author of seven books in the Turkish language, mainly on Middle East issues, including the best-seller Mesopotamia Express: A Journey in History. ", "article_4": "Low-profile Turkish intelligence chief seen as driving force behind the states clandestine peace talks with the PKK.  Hakan Fidan, the head of Turkish intelligence, is seen as one of the key players behind the announcement by Abdullah Ocalan, the jailed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) leader, of a ceasefire in the countrys decades-old conflict.  Fidan, 45, was appointed to the top spy seat by close ally Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Turkish Prime Minister, in May 2010.  He took part in peace talks with senior figures from the PKK in Oslo in 2009, which unravelled in 2011 when secret recordings were leaked to the media revealing the discussions.  After the failed negotiations, Erdogans government delegated Fidan to hold talks with Ocalan, who is serving a life sentence on the isolated prison island of Imrali, near Istanbul.  When state prosecutors last year asked the senior intelligence official to shed light on whose authority the agency held the Oslo talks, Erdogan publicly voiced support for his ally.  \"He is my secret-keeper, he is the states secret-keeper\" - Recep Tayyip Erdogan \"It was me who sent him to Oslo and to Imrali,\" the premier said.  \"He is my secret-keeper, he is the states secret-keeper\" Erdogan said, describing Fidan as a \"very well-trained bureaucrat. \" Erdogans ruling party later introduced a bill in parliament requiring the prime ministers authorisation to interrogate the spy agencys agents, effectively immunising Fidan from any prosecution.  'Gulen links Details about Fidans life are largely confidential because of his role at the top of Turkeys National Intelligence Organisation (MIT).  According to a brief resume on the MITs official website, Fidan served in the Turkish Armed Forces as a non-commissioned officer.  He also worked at NATOs Germany-based Allied Rapid Reaction Corps.  The married father-of-three has a bachelors degree in political science and government from the University of Maryland University College.  He also earned a masters and a doctoral degree at Ankaras private Bilkent University.  Fidan headed a public agency for development known as TIKA, which is active in the Turkic states and Africa but also in other Muslim countries where Turkey has been trying to gain a foothold as part of its strategy to become a regional power.  Local media have reported that he fostered ties with an influential Islamic movement headed by Fethullah Gulen, who lives in exile in the US, during his four-year tenure at TIKA.  The Gulen movement, which has dozens of schools abroad, is considered close to Erdogans Islamic-rooted Justice and Development Party, in power since 2002.  Before he was appointed the new head of MIT, Fidan worked in Erdogans office as a deputy undersecretary.  He is also known to have worked closely with Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu.  Future premier Following Fidans MIT appointment in 2010, Israeli daily Haaretz reported that the Israeli defence establishment, particularly Mossad, viewed his promotion with concern, accusing him of steering Turkey away from the Israel and closer to Iran.  The paper cited unnamed Israeli sources as speculating that Fidan, along with Erdogan and Davutoglu, orchestrated a change in Turkish-Israeli ties - which were wrecked after Israeli commandos raided a Gaza-bound aid flotilla, killing nine Turks on board.  In an opinion piece last year, Fatih Altayli, the editor in chief of the daily Haber-Turk, claimed that Erdogan was grooming Fidan for the post of prime minister.  \"He [Erdogan] brings Fidan along in many important talks with foreign heads of state.  It feels like he is considering Hakan Fidan for an important mission in the future,\" Altayli said.  If Fidans efforts continue to bear fruit, the peace talks could lead to the disarmament of about 4,000 PKK fighters in southeast Turkey and northern Iraq and, ultimately, to the end of a 29-year-old rebellion that has cost some 45,000 lives, mostly Kurdish.

For other uses, see Gluck (disambiguation) Christoph Willibald (Ritter von) Gluck ( German: ['kRIstof 'vIlIbalt 'glUk]; 2 July 1714 - 15 November 1787) was a composer of Italian and French opera in the early classical period.  Born in the Upper Palatinate and raised in Bohemia, both part of the Holy Roman Empire, he gained prominence at the Habsburg court at Vienna.  There he brought about the practical reform of opera's dramaturgical practices for which many intellectuals had been campaigning.  With a series of radical new works in the 1760s, among them Orfeo ed Euridice and Alceste, he broke the stranglehold that Metastasian opera seria had enjoyed for much of the century.  Gluck introduced more drama by using orchestral recitative and cutting the usually long da capo aria.  His later operas have half the length of a typical baroque opera.  Haydn, Mozart, Schubert, Berlioz and Wagner revered Gluck very highly.  The strong influence of French opera encouraged Gluck to move to Paris in November 1773.  Fusing the traditions of Italian opera and the French (with rich chorus) into a unique synthesis, Gluck wrote eight operas for the Parisian stage.  Iphigenie en Tauride (1779) was a great success and is generally acknowledged to be his finest work.  Though he was extremely popular and widely credited with bringing about a revolution in French opera, Gluck's mastery of the Parisian operatic scene was never absolute, and after the poor reception of his Echo et Narcisse (1779), he left Paris in disgust and returned to Vienna to live out the remainder of his life. Ancestry and early years  Statue of Gluck in Weidenwang Gluck's earliest known ancestor is his great-grandfather, Simon Gluckh von Rockenzahn, whose name is recorded in the marriage contract (1672) of his son, the forester Johann (Hans) Adam Gluck (c.  1649-1722) and grandfather of Christoph. 'Rockenzahn' is believed to be Rokycany, located in the central part of western Bohemia (about 70 km southwest of Prague and 16 km east of Pilsen). The family name Gluck (also spelled Gluckh, Klugh, Kluch, etc. ) likely comes from the Czech word for boy (kluk). In its various spellings, it is repeatedly found in the records of Rokycany. Around 1675 Hans Adam moved to Neustadt an der Waldnaab in the service of Prince Ferdinand August von Lobkowitz, who possessed extensive landholdings in Bohemia as well as the county of Stornstein-Neustadt in the Upper Palatinate. Gluck's father, Alexander, was born in Neustadt an der Waldnaab on 28 October 1683, one of four sons of Hans Adam Gluck who became foresters or gamekeepers. Alexander served in a contingent of about 50 soldiers under Philipp Hyazinth von Lobkowitz, the son of Ferdinand August von Lobkowitz, during the War of Spanish Succession, and, according to Gluck family tradition, rose to the level of gunbearer to the great general of the imperial forces, Eugene of Savoy. In 1711 Alexander settled outside Berching as a forester and hunter in the service of the monastery Seligenporten, Plankstetten Abbey, and the mayors of Neumarkt in der Oberpfalz. He took the vacant position of hunter in Erasbach in 1711 or 1712 (his predecessor had been found shot in the forest). House in Erasbach , constructed in 1713 by Gluck's father, where many believe the composer was born.  About Gluck's mother, Maria Walburga, almost nothing is known, including her surname, but she probably grew up in the same area as she was named after Saint Walburga, the sister of Saint Willibald, the first bishop of nearby Eichstatt. The couple probably married around 1711. In 1713 Alexander built a house in Erasbach and by 12 September had taken possession of it. Although there is no documentary record with Gluck's birthdate at the time of his birth, he himself gave it as 2 July 1714 on an official document requested by Paris that he signed in 1785 in Vienna in the presence of the French ambassador Emmanuel Marie Louis de Noailles.  This has long been the commonly accepted date. He was baptized Christophorus Willibaldus on 4 July 1714 in the village of Weidenwang, a parish that at that time also included Erasbach. Gluck himself never used the name Willibald.  The church in Weidenwang was consecrated to Saint Willibald (as was the entire Eichstatt diocese to which it belonged), and the name Willibald is frequently found in the baptismal register, often as a second name.  No documents contemporary with Gluck's life use the name Willibald.  Only in the 19th century did scholars begin using it to distinguish the composer from his father's brother Johann Christoph, born in 1700, whose baptism had earlier been confused with that of the composer. In the year of Gluck's birth, the Treaty of Rastatt and the Treaty of Baden ended the War of Spanish Succession and brought Erasbach under Bavarian control. Gluck's father had to reapply to retain his position and received no salary until after 1715, when he began receiving 20 gulden.  He obtained additional employment in the vicinity of Weidenwang in 1715 as a forester in the service of Seligenporten Monastery, and after 1715, also with Plankstetten Abbey.  In 1716 Alexander Gluck was cited for poor performance and warned he might be terminated. He sold his house in August 1717 and voluntarily left Erasbach near the end of September to take up employment as head forester in Reichstadt, serving the Duchess of Tuscany, the wealthy Anna Maria Franziska of Saxe-Lauenburg, since 1708 separated from her husband Gian Gastone de' Medici, the last duke of Tuscany. On 1 April 1722 Alexander Gluck took a position as forest-master under Count Philipp Joseph von Kinsky in Bohmisch Kamnitz, where Kinsky had increased his domains. The family moved to the forester's house in nearby Oberkreibitz. Jezeri Castle The Jesuit church in Komotau In 1727 Alexander moved with his family to Eisenberg (Jezeri in Horni Jiretin) to take his final post, head forester to Prince Philipp Hyazinth von Lobkowitz. It is not sure if Christoph was sent to the Jesuit college in Komotau, 20 km southwest. The Alsatian painter Johann Christian von Mannlich relates in his memoirs, published in 1810, that Gluck told him about his early life in 1774.  He quotes Gluck as saying: My father was forest master at N. . .  in Bohemia and he planned that eventually I should succeed him.  In my homeland everyone is musical; music is taught in the schools, and in the tiniest villages the peasants sing and play different instruments during High Mass in their churches.  As I was passionate about the art, I made rapid progress.  I played several instruments and the schoolmaster, singling me out from the other pupils, gave me lessons at his house when he was off duty.  I no longer thought and dreamt of anything but music; the art of forestry was neglected. In 1727 or 1728, when Gluck was 13 or 14, he went to Prague. A childhood flight from home to Vienna is included in several contemporary accounts of Gluck's life, including Mannlich's, but some scholars have cast doubt on Gluck's picturesque tales of earning food and shelter by his singing as he travelled.  Most now feel it is more likely that the object of Gluck's travels was not Vienna but Prague. Gluck's German biographer Hans Joachim Moser claimed in 1940 to have found documents showing Gluck matriculated in logic and mathematics at the University of Prague in 1731. Gerhard and Renate Croll find this astonishing, and other biographers have been unable to find any documents supporting Moser's claim. At the time the University of Prague boasted a flourishing musical scene that included performances of both Italian opera and oratorio. Gluck sang and played violin and cello, and also the organ at Tyn Church. Gluck eventually left Prague without taking a degree, and vanishes from the historical record until 1737. Nevertheless, the memories of his family and indirect references to this period in later documents give good grounds for believing Gluck arrived in Vienna in 1734, where he likely was employed by the Lobkowitz family at their palace in the Minoritenplatz.  Philipp Hyazinth Lobkowitz, Gluck's father's employer, died on 21 December 1734, and his successor, his brother Georg Christian Lobkowitz, is thought to have been Gluck's employer in Vienna from 1735 to 1736.  Two operas with texts Gluck himself was later to set were performed during this period: Antonio Caldara's La clemenza di Tito (1734) and Le cinesi (1735).  It is likely that the Lobkowitz family introduced Gluck to the Milanese nobleman Prince Antonio Maria Melzi, who engaged Gluck to become a player in his orchestra in Milan.  The 65-year-old prince married the 16-year-old Maria Renata, Countess of Harrach, on 3 January 1737, and not long after returned with Gluck to Milan. According to the music historian Daniel Heartz, there has been considerable controversy concerning Gluck's native language.  Gluck's protege in Vienna, the Italian-born Antonio Salieri, wrote in his memoirs (translated into German by Ignaz von Mosel), that \"Gluck, whose native tongue was Czech, expressed himself in German only with effort, and still more so in French and Italian. \" Salieri also mentions that Gluck mixed several languages when speaking: German, Italian and French, like Salieri himself. Gluck's first biographer, Anton Franz Schmid , wrote that Gluck grew up in a German-speaking area, and that Gluck learned to speak Czech, but did not need it in Prague and in his later life. Heartz writes: \"More devious manoeuvres have been attempted by Gluck's German biographers of this [the 20th] century, while the French ones have, without exception, taken Salieri at his word.  His German biographer Max Arend objected that not a single letter written in Czech can be found, to which Jacques-Gabriel Prod'homme countered that \"no letters written by Liszt in Hungarian were known either, but does this make him a German?\" Hans Joachim Moser wanted a lyric work in Czech as proof. In fact, the music theorist Laurent Garcin, writing in 1770 (published 1772) before Gluck arrived in Paris, included Gluck in a list of several composers of Czech operas-comiques (although such a work by Gluck has yet to be documented). A presentation by Irene Brandenburg classifying Gluck as a Bohemian composer was considered controversial by her German colleagues. In 1737 Gluck arrived in Milan, and was introduced to Giovanni Battista Sammartini, who, according to Giuseppe Carpani, taught Gluck \"practical knowledge of all the instruments\". Apparently, this relationship lasted for several years.  Sammartini was not, primarily, a composer of opera, his main output being of sacred music and symphonies, but Milan boasted a vibrant opera scene, and Gluck soon formed an association with one of the city's up-and-coming opera houses, the Teatro Regio Ducale.  There his first opera Artaserse was performed on 26 December 1741, dedicated to Otto Ferdinand von Abensberg und Traun.  Set to a libretto by Metastasio, the opera opened the Milanese Carnival of 1742.  According to one anecdote, the public would not accept Gluck's style until he inserted an aria in the lighter Milanese manner for contrast.  Nevertheless, Gluck composed an opera for each of the next four Carnivals at Milan, with renowned castrato Giovanni Carestini appearing in many of the performances, so the reaction to Artaserse was likely to have been reasonably favorable.  He also wrote operas for other cities of Northern Italy in between Carnival seasons, including Turin and Venice, where his Ipermestra was given during November 1744 at the Teatro San Giovanni Crisostomo.  Nearly all of his operas in this period were set to Metastasio's texts, despite the poet's dislike for his style of composition.  Bust of Gluck, whose face was noticeably pockmarked In 1745 Gluck accepted an invitation from Lord Middlesex to become house composer at London's King's Theatre, probably travelling to England via Frankfurt and in the company of the violinist Ferdinand Philipp Joseph von Lobkowitz, the son of Phillip Hyacinth.  The timing was poor, as the Jacobite Rebellion had caused much panic in London, and for most of the year, the King's Theatre was closed.  Six trio sonatas were the immediate fruits of his time.  Gluck's two London operas (La caduta de' giganti and Artamene), eventually performed in 1746, borrowed much from his earlier works.  Gluck performed works by Galuppi and Lampugnani, who both had worked in London.  A more long-term benefit was exposure to the music of Handel - whom he later credited as a great influence on his style - and the naturalistic acting style of David Garrick, an English theatrical reformer.  On 25 March, shortly after the production of Artamene, Handel and Gluck together gave a concert in the Haymarket Theatre consisting of works by Gluck and an organ concerto by Handel, played by the composer.  On 14 April Gluck played on a glassharmonica in Hickford's Rooms, a concert hall in Brewer Street, Soho. Handel's own experience of Gluck pleased that composer less: Charles Burney reports Handel as saying that \"he [Gluck] knows no more of contrapunto, as my cook, Waltz\". The years 1747 and 1748 brought Gluck two highly prestigious engagements.  First came a commission to produce an opera for Pillnitz, performed by Pietro Mingotti's troupe, to celebrate a royal double wedding that would unite the ruling families of Bavaria and Saxony.  Le nozze d'Ercole e d'Ebe, a festa teatrale, borrowed heavily from earlier works, and even from Gluck's teacher Sammartini.  The success of this work brought Gluck to the attention of the Viennese court, and, ahead of such a figure as Johann Adolph Hasse, he was selected to set Metastasio's La Semiramide riconosciuta to celebrate Maria Theresa's birthday.  Vittoria Tesi took the title role.  On this occasion Gluck's music was completely original, but the displeasure of the court poet, Metastasio, who called the opera \"archvandalian music\", probably explains why Gluck did not remain long in Vienna despite the work's enormous popular success (it was performed 27 times to great acclaim).  For the remainder of 1748 and 1749 Gluck travelled with Mingotti's troupe, contracting a venereal disease from the prima donna and composing the opera La contesa de' numi for the court at Copenhagen, where he repeated his concert on the glassharmonica.  Il Parnaso confuso by Christoph Willibald Gluck (music) and Pietro Metastasio (libretto).  Performed on 24 January 1765 by the children of Johann Franz Greipel -by Christoph Willibald Gluck (music) and Pietro Metastasio (libretto).  Performed on 24 January 1765 by the children of Maria Theresia : Maria Amalia (Apollo), Maria Elisabeth (Melpomene), Maria Josepha (Euterpe), Maria Karolina (Erato), Leopold (Harpsichord) In 1750 he abandoned Mingotti's group for another company established by a former member of the Mingotti troupe, Giovanni Battista Locatelli.  The main effect of this was that Gluck returned to Prague on a more consistent basis.  For the Prague Carnival of 1750 Gluck composed a new opera, Ezio (again set to one of Metastasio's works, with the manuscript located at the Lobkowicz Palace).  His Ipermestra was also performed in the same year.  The other major event of Gluck's stay in Prague was, on 15 September 1750, his marriage to Maria Anna Bergin, aged 18 years old, the daughter of a rich (but long-dead) Viennese merchant. Gluck seems to have spent most of 1751 commuting between Prague and Vienna.  The year 1752 brought another major commission to Gluck, when he was asked to set Metastasio's La clemenza di Tito (the specific libretto was the composer's choice) for the name day celebrations of King Charles VII of Naples.  The opera was performed on 4 November at the Teatro di San Carlo, and the world-famous castrato Caffarelli took the role of Sextus.  For Caffarelli Gluck composed the famous, but notoriously difficult, aria \"Se mai senti spirarti sul volto\", which provoked admiration and vituperation in equally large measures.  Gluck later reworked this aria for his Iphigenie en Tauride.  According to one account, the Neapolitan composer Francesco Durante claimed that his fellow composers \"should have been proud to have conceived and written [the aria]\".  Durante simultaneously declined to comment whether or not it was within the boundaries of the accepted compositional rules of the time. Le cinesi (1973).  The work is very much in the vein of the Le cinesi reflects cultural overlap between the Austrian court and the distant Chinese court.  In Le cinesi, Metastasio gives a lesson on the different forms of theatre: pastoral, comedy and tragedy.  Carmen Lavani in(1973).  The work is very much in the vein of the chinoiserie so popular in its time. reflects cultural overlap between the Austrian court and the distant Chinese court.  In, Metastasio gives a lesson on the different forms of theatre: pastoral, comedy and tragedy.  Gluck finally settled in Vienna, where he became Kapellmeister invited by Prince Joseph of Saxe-Hildburghausen.  He wrote Le cinesi for a festival in 1754 and La danza for the eighth birthday of the future Emperor Leopold II the following year.  After his opera Antigono was performed in Rome in February 1756, Gluck was made a Knight of the Golden Spur by Pope Benedict XIV.  From that time on, Gluck used the title \"Ritter von Gluck\" or \"Chevalier de Gluck\".  Gluck turned his back on Italian opera seria and began to write opera comiques.  In 1761 Gluck produced the groundbreaking ballet-pantomime Don Juan in collaboration with the choreographer Gasparo Angiolini; the more radical Jean-Georges Noverre was involved for the first time? The climax of Gluck's opera comique writing was La rencontre imprevue (1764).  By that time, Gluck created musical drama, based on Greek tragedy, with more compassion, influencing the latest style Sturm und Drang.  Under the teaching of Gluck, Marie Antoinette developed into a good musician.  She learned to play the harp, the harpsichord and the flute.  She sang during the family's evening gatherings, as she had a beautiful voice. All her brothers and sisters were involved in playing Gluck's music; on 24 January 1765 her brother Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor directed one of Gluck's compositions, Il Parnaso confuso.  In Spring 1774, she took under her patronage her former music teacher and introduced him to the Paris public.  For that purpose, she asked him to compose a new opera, Iphigenie en Aulide.  \"Mindful of the Querelle des Bouffons between adherents of Italian and French opera, she asked the composer to set the libretto in French. \" To get to her goals she was assisted by the singers Rosalie Levasseur and Sophie Arnould.  Gluck had gruff ways, demanding strict adherence from the cast when rehearsing.  Gluck told the bass-bariton Henri Larrivee to change his ways.  The soprano Arnould was replaced.  He insisted that the chorus, too, had to act and become a part of the drama - that they could no longer just stand there posing stiffly and without expression while singing their lines.  Gluck was assisted by Francois-Joseph Gossec, director of the Concert Spirituel.  The Chevalier de Saint-Georges attended the first performance on 19 April; Jean-Jacques Rousseau was delighted with Gluck melodic style.  Marie Antoinette received a large share of the credit. Title-page of the first printed score Gluck had long pondered the fundamental problem of form and content in opera.  He thought both of the main Italian operatic genres, opera buffa and opera seria, had strayed too far from what opera should really be and seemed unnatural.  Opera buffa had long lost its original freshness.  Its jokes were threadbare and the repetition of the same characters made them seem no more than stereotypes.  In opera seria, the singing was devoted to superficial effects and the content was uninteresting and fossilised.  As in opera buffa, the singers were effectively absolute masters of the stage and the music, decorating the vocal lines so floridly that audiences could no longer recognise the original melody.  Gluck wanted to return opera to its origins, focusing on human drama and passions and making words and music of equal importance.  Francesco Algarotti's Essay on the Opera (1755) proved to be an inspiration for Gluck's reforms.  He advocated that opera seria had to return to basics and that all the various elements--music (both instrumental and vocal), ballet, and staging--must be subservient to the overriding drama.  Several composers of the period, including Niccolo Jommelli and Tommaso Traetta, attempted to put these ideals into practice (and added more ballets).  In Vienna, Gluck met like-minded figures in the operatic world: Count Giacomo Durazzo, the head of the court theatre, and one of the primary instigators of operatic reform in Vienna ; the librettist Ranieri de' Calzabigi, who wanted to attack the dominance of Metastasian opera seria; the innovative choreographer Gasparo Angiolini; and the London-trained castrato Gaetano Guadagni.  The first result of the new thinking was Gluck's reformist ballet Don Juan, but a more important work was soon to follow.  On 5 October 1762, Orfeo ed Euridice was given its first performance, on a libretto by Calzabigi, set to music by Gluck.  Gluck tried to achieve a noble, Neo-Classical or \"beautiful simplicity\".  The dances were arranged by Angiolini and the title role was taken by Guadagni, a catalytic force in Gluck's reform, renowned for his unorthodox acting and singing style.  Orfeo, which has never left the standard repertory, showed the beginnings of Gluck's reforms.  His idea was to make the drama of the work more important than the star singers who performed it, and to do away with dry recitative (recitativo secco, accompanied only by continuo) that broke up the action.  In 1765 Melchior Grimm published \"Poeme lyrique\", an influential article for the Encyclopedie on lyric and opera librettos. Alceste Set design for the premiere of the revised, French-language version of Gluck and Calzabigi followed Orfeo with Alceste (1767) and Paride ed Elena (1770), dedicated to his friend Joao Carlos de Braganca (Duke de Lafoes), an expert on music and mythology, pushing their innovations even further.  Calzabigi wrote a preface to Alceste, which Gluck signed, setting out the principles of their reforms: no da capo arias no opportunity for vocal improvisation or virtuosic displays of vocal agility or power no long melismas a more predominantly syllabic setting of the text to make the words more intelligible far less repetition of text within an aria a blurring of the distinction between recitative and aria, declamatory and lyrical passages, with altogether less recitative accompanied rather than secco recitative simpler, more flowing melodic lines an overture that is linked by theme or mood to the ensuing action Joseph von Sonnenfels praised Gluck's tremendous imagination and the setting after attending a performance of Alceste. In 1769 Gluck performed his operas in Parma.  On 2 September 1771 Charles Burney visited Gluck, living in Sankt Marx.  Burney thought Gluck's preface, in which Gluck gives his \"reasons for deviating from the beaten track\", important enough to give it almost in its entirety: \"It was my intention to confine music to its true dramatic province, of assisting poetical expression, and of augmenting the interest of the fable; without interrupting the action, or chilling it with useless and superfluous ornaments; for the office of music, when joined to poetry, seemed to me, to resemble that of colouring in a correct and well disposed design, where the lights and shades only seem to animate the figures, without altering the out-line. \" On 11 September Burney went to see Gluck to say goodbye; Gluck was still in bed, as he used to work in the night. As his operas were not appreciated by Frederick II of Prussia, Gluck began to focus on France. Under the patronage of Marie Antoinette, who had married the future French King Louis XVI in 1770, Gluck signed a contract for six stage works with the management of the Paris Opera.  He began with Iphigenie en Aulide.  The premiere on 19 April 1774 sparked a huge controversy, almost a war, such as had not been seen in the city since the Querelle des Bouffons.  Gluck's opponents brought the leading Italian composer Niccolo Piccinni to Paris to demonstrate the superiority of Neapolitan opera, and the \"whole town\" engaged in an argument between \"Gluckists\" and \"Piccinnists\".  The composers themselves took no part in the polemics, but when Piccinni was asked to set the libretto to Roland, on which Gluck was also known to be working, Gluck destroyed everything he had written for that opera up to that point.  On 2 August 1774 the French version of Orfeo ed Euridice was performed, more Rameau-like, with the title role transposed from the castrato to the tenor voice.  This time Gluck's work was better received by the Parisian public.  In the same year, Gluck returned to Vienna, where he was appointed composer to the imperial court (18 October 1774) after 20 years serving as Kapellmeister.  Over the next few years, the now internationally famous composer would travel back and forth between Paris and Vienna.  He became friends with the poet Klopstock in Karlsruhe.  On 23 April 1776, the French version of Alceste was given.  During the rehearsals for Echo et Narcisse in September 1779, Gluck became dangerously ill. Since the opera itself was a failure, running for only 12 performances, Gluck decided to return to Vienna within two weeks.  In that city Die unvermuthete Zusammenkunft or Die Pilgrime von Mekka (1772), a German version of La rencontre imprevue, had been performed 51 times. His musical heir in Paris was the composer Antonio Salieri, who had been Gluck's protege since he arrived in Vienna in 1767, and later had made friends with Gluck.  Gluck brought Salieri to Paris with him and bequeathed him the libretto for Les Danaides by Francois-Louis Gand Le Bland Du Roullet and baron de Tschudi.  The opera was announced as a collaboration between the two composers; however, after the overwhelming success of its premiere on 26 April 1784, Gluck revealed to the prestigious Journal de Paris that the work was wholly Salieri's. Gluck lived and died in the Wiedner Hauptstrasse Nr.  32 in Vienna In Vienna Gluck wrote a few more minor works, spending the Summer with his wife in Perchtoldsdorf, famous for its wine (Heuriger).  Gluck suffered from melancholy and high blood pressure. In 1781, he brought out a German version of Iphigenie en Tauride.  Gluck dominated the season's proceedings with 32 performances. On 23 March 1783 he seems to have attended a concert by Mozart who played KV 455, variations on La Rencontre imprevue by Gluck (Wq.  32). On 15 November 1787, lunching with friends, Gluck suffered a heart arrhythmia and died a few hours later, at the age of 73.  Usually, it is mentioned Gluck had several strokes and became paralyzed on his right side.  Robl, a family doctor, had doubts as Gluck was still able to play his clavicord or piano in 1783. At a formal commemoration on 8 April 1788, his friend, pupil and successor Salieri conducted Gluck's De profundis, and a requiem by the Italian composer Niccolo Jommelli was given.  His death opened the way for Mozart at court, according to H.  C.  Robbins Landon. [citation needed] Gluck was buried in the Matzleinsdorfer Friedhof.  On 29 September 1890 his remains were transferred to the Zentralfriedhof; a tomb was erected containing the original plaque. Although only half of his work survived after a fire in 1809, Gluck's musical legacy includes approximately 35 complete full-length operas plus around a dozen shorter operas and operatic introductions, as well as numerous ballets and instrumental works.  His reforms influenced Mozart, particularly his opera Idomeneo (1781). He left behind a flourishing school of disciples in Paris, who would dominate the French stage throughout the Revolutionary and Napoleonic period.  As well as Salieri, they included Sacchini, Cherubini, Mehul and Spontini.  His greatest French admirer would be Hector Berlioz, whose epic Les Troyens may be seen as the culmination of the Gluckian tradition.  Though Gluck wrote no operas in German, his example influenced the German school of opera, particularly Carl Maria von Weber and Richard Wagner, whose concept of music drama was not so far removed from Gluck's own. For a complete list of Gluck's works in order of Wq.  catalogue number, see List of compositions by Christoph Willibald Gluck Notes  Sources ", "article_1": "Summary On Dec.  26, 1741, in the Teatro Ducal in Milan, Gluck had his first great dramatic success with his first opera, Artaserse, to a libretto by P.  Metastasio.  Until 1745 there then followed an annual succession of operas for this theatre: Demofoonte (1742), Arsace (in collaboration with G. B.  Lampugnani; 1743), Sofonisba (1744), and Ippolito (1745).  In addition, Gluck wrote Cleonice (Demetrio) (1742) for Venice; Il Tigrane (1743) for Crema; and Poro (1744) for Turin.  In these early works, of which mostly only fragments have survived, Gluck largely followed the existing Italian operatic fashion--melodic but never grand, charming without intensity.  Occasional intensely passionate outbursts and the beginning of characterization, however, foreshadowed the great dramatic composer he was to become.  Gluck, whose father probably intended for him to continue in the family employment of forestry, at an early age showed a strong inclination toward music .  In order to escape from disagreements with his father, the young Gluck left home (probably about 1727) and, supporting himself by his music, made his way to Prague , where he played in several churches, began university work (1731), and continued his musical studies.  He went to Vienna in the winter of 1735-36.  There he was discovered by a Lombard nobleman who took him to Milan , where Gluck, apart from fulfilling his duties in the Melzi family chapel, spent four years studying composition with the Italian organist and composer Giovanni Battista Sammartini , from whom he learned the new Italian style of instrumental music.  Probably six trio sonatas, each consisting of two movements with a minuet as conclusion and printed in London in 1746, were the fruits of his studies with Sammartini in Milan.  Besides the six \"London\" sonatas, Gluck probably composed further trio sonatas under Sammartini.  The middle years In 1745 Gluck, by then well known as an operatic composer, was invited to England at the instigation of Lord Middlesex, director of Italian opera at the Haymarket Theatre, London, in order to challenge Handels solid hold on London opera goers.  The plan at first failed when, because of the political chaos caused by the Stuart rising, all theatres in London were closed before Gluck arrived in England.  When the situation became calmer, theatrical activities recommenced with a performance of Glucks opera La caduta de giganti on Jan.  17, 1746; the libretto, by A. F.  Vanneschi, glorified the hero of the day, the Duke of Cumberland, after his victory at Culloden over the forces of Prince Charles Edward, the Stuart claimant to the British throne.  This work, as well as Glucks second London opera, Artamene, produced on March 14, 1746, consisted largely of music from his own earlier works, lack of time having forced him to this device.  Neither opera met with success.  On March 25, shortly after the production of Artamene, Handel and Gluck together gave a concert in the Haymarket Theatre consisting of works by Gluck and an organ concerto by Handel, played by the composer.  Gluck had won Handels interest despite the latters later much-quoted criticism of Glucks lack of contrapuntal ability (Handel said that Gluck \"knows no more counterpoint than my cook\").  Gluck himself, according to the Irish singer Michael Kelly, tried to emulate Handel, whom he described as the \"divine master of our art. \" After he left England (possibly in 1746) Gluck came into contact with two travelling opera companies, one of which, on June 29, 1747, performed his opera-serenade Le nozze dErcole e dEbe at Pillnitz Castle, near Dresden, on the occasion of the double wedding between the electoral families of Bavaria and Saxony.  By early 1748 at the latest, Gluck was back in Vienna, at work on Pietro Metastasios Semiramide riconosciuta, with which, on May 14, 1748, the Burgtheater was inaugurated.  It proved a brilliant success for the composer, although Metastasio privately termed its music \"insupportably barbaric. \" At that time Gluck met his future wife, Marianne Pergin, the 16-year-old daughter of a rich merchant; in the same year, as conductor of the P.  and A.  Mingotti Travelling Opera company, he travelled via Hamburg to Copenhagen, where he composed the opera-serenade La contesa dei Numi in celebration of the birth of the heir to the Danish throne; the work in some respects foreshadows his later reform operas.  During the following two winters Gluck was in Prague, where he wrote Ezio (1750) and Issipile (1751-52).  On Sept.  15, 1750, he married Marianne in the Church of St.  Ulrich in Vienna.  Their marriage, which produced no children, was reportedly harmonious--and no doubt his wifes connections were to Glucks advantage.  Gluck later adopted his niece, Marianne.  Before the young couple set up a permanent home in Vienna in the winter of 1752-53, Gluck took his wife to Naples for the summer of 1752, where he composed music for Metastasios drama La clemenza di Tito after having rejected the text of Arsace, which he had already once set to music.  In Vienna, Gluck soon found a patron in the imperial field marshal Prince Joseph Friedrich von Sachsen-Hildburghausen, who engaged him first as Konzertmeister of his orchestra and later as Kapellmeister.  Gluck gave successful performances of his symphonies and arias at weekly concerts in the Princes palace and made a particular impression with his opera-serenade Le Cinesi, which was performed on Sept.  24, 1754, in the presence of the Emperor and Empress at a magnificent celebration at Schlosshof Castle.  This success may well have contributed to the decision of the director of the court theatre to entrust the provision of the \"theatrical and academic music\" for the imperial court to Gluck.  On May 5, 1755, Glucks opera-serenade La danza was performed at the imperial Castle of Laxenburg, near Vienna, and on December 8 of the same year followed Linnocenza giustificata.  The following year (1756) Vienna saw Il repastore, while the first performance of the opera Antigono was given during a visit to Rome.  In Rome Gluck was created Knight of the Golden Spur, and after his return to Vienna he set to work to provide music for a number of French vaudeville comedies imported from Paris.  Tircis et Doristee (1756) may have been a first attempt at this genre.  In these Parisian comedies the dialogue was spoken or sung in the manner of street songs, so-called timbres.  After 1758 Gluck proceeded more independently and composed for such works as La Fausse Esclave, LIle de Merlin (1758), La Cythere assiegee (1759), Le Diable a quatre, LArbre enchante (1759), LIvrogne corrige (1760), and Le Cadi dupe (1761), which contained, in addition to the overture, a steadily increasing number of new songs in place of the stock vaudeville tunes.  In La Rencontre imprevue, first performed in Vienna on Jan.  7, 1764, no vaudeville elements remain at all, with the result that the work is a perfect example of opera comique.  Gluck gave the scores of Le Cadi dupe and La Rencontre imprevue particular charm by using \"oriental\" instrumental effects.  In many of the arias, tuneful melody and programmatic writing foreshadow later developments in Glucks operatic style: in, for instance, the first examples of complex scene development in LIle de Merlin and LIvrogne corrige. ", "article_2": "One of the great masters of 18th century opera, Gluck is known for his elegant synthesis of the French and Italian operatic traditions, exemplified by such remarkable works as Orfeo ed Euridice and Alceste.  A native of the Upper Palatinate, Gluck first studied with the Czech cellist and composer (and Franciscan friar) Bohuslav Cernohorsky, later continuing his studies with Sammartini in Italy.  Already known as an opera composer in the 1740s, Gluck visited Paris and London, where he met Handel.  He married in 1750, settling in Vienna as an opera conductor.  In 1762, Gluck wrote his Orfeo ed Euridice, heralding a new era in the history of opera.  Combining the Classical ideals of beauty and simplicity with an innate sense of dramatic impetus, it broke down many of the overwrought formal conventions of the Baroque and set the standard for a whole generation of operatic composers.  In many ways, opera in the 19th century had its conception in the works of Gluck.  While Gluck achieved wide fame in his own time, his works are rare in opera houses today; he is primarily remembered as a reformer and revolutionary.  In his dedication to Alceste, Gluck wrote that he \"sought to confine music to its true function of serving poetry by expressing feelings and the situations of the story without interrupting and cooling off the action through useless and superfluous ornaments. \" This statement has often been interpreted as a desire to subordinate music to poetry; however, what inspired Gluck's reform was his belief that music gains in expressiveness when it is properly balanced with poetry.  Thus, for example, by abolishing the traditional strict separation of recitative and aria, Gluck used music as a means of maintaining an uninterrupted flow of the dramatic action.  Gluck's librettist for Orfeo ed Euridice, Alceste, and Paride ed Elena -- the three works best representing his reformist ideas -- was Raniero de Calzabigi, a poet and critic who anticipated some of the composer's fundamental ideas concerning poetry and music.  For example, Calzabigi opposed the traditional poetic approach to mythology, exemplified by Pietro Metastasio, the greatest librettist of the opera seria tradition.  While Metastasio's mythological figures appear as thinly disguised 18th century characters, Calzabigi's poetry strives to create an atmosphere of timelessness, which perfectly suited Gluck's artistic intentions.  After bringing his reforms to fruition, Gluck had several new works produced in Paris.  The most remarkable of these works is Armide (1777), based on an old libretto by Philippe Quinault, which Lully used for his eponymous work in 1686.  Viewed by conservatives as an attack on the French musical and literary traditions, Gluck's operas were targeted by a literary cabal, which decided to embrace Niccolo Piccinni, a respected composer of comic operas, as a standard-bearer.  In a literary squabble reminiscent of the \"quarrel of the buffoons\" in 1752, the traditionalists proclaimed the superiority of traditional (that is: Italian, or, more precisely, Metastasian) opera over French opera, represented by the iconoclastic Gluck.  It should be noted that the two composers, who respected each other, refused to participate in the war of words, leaving the polemics to Parisian pseudo-intellectuals.  In essence, Gluck's victory over his adversaries was the triumph of music.  His works are regarded as seminal contributions to musical drama, and his ideas were gradually accepted, first by Piccinni himself, and later by Cherubini, who flourished as an opera composer in the 1790s and early 1800s.  In the 19th century, Gluck's approach to opera was adopted by Spontini, who, in turn, influenced Berlioz as an opera composer. ", "article_3": "Christoph Willibald Ritter von Gluck (July 2, 1714 - November 15, 1787) was the son of the gamekeeper to the Bohemian noble to Prince Ferdinand August von Lobkowitz.  He studied music at the Jesuit seminary at Komotau (now Chomutov, Czech Republic) and also in Prague and Milan.  In Milan he studied with the Italian composer Giovanni Battista Sammartini.  Gluck's first opera, Artaserse, was produced at La Scala, Milan, in 1741.  During the following nine years he wrote and produced more than a dozen operas in various European cities.  Among these works were Sofonisba (1744) and Artamene (1746).  In 1750 he took up residence in Vienna, which was thereafter the center of his activities except for periods spent in Naples, Rome, and Paris.  In 1754 Maria Theresa, archduchess of Austria, appointed him director of opera at her court theater.  Among the operas Gluck wrote between 1750 and 1760 were La clemenza di Tito (The Clemency of Titus, 1752) and Antigono (1756).  Up until 1762 Gluck composed in the contemporary operatic style, cultivated chiefly in Italy, which was marked by music written primarily to give virtuoso singers opportunity to display their skill.  As his career progressed, however, Gluck grew dissatisfied with the current conventions of Italian opera, characterized by surface brilliance and over-ornamentation.  He began to develop a style intended to restore opera to its original purpose of expressing in music the meaning or emotion conveyed by the words.  To this end he also worked closely with the great French ballet reformer Jean-Georges Noverre.  About 1760 he became acquainted with the Italian poet Ranieri de' Calzabigi, who wrote a libretto for Gluck that admirably suited the composer's ideas concerning proper balance between words and music.  The opera that resulted was Orfeo ed Euridice, which surpassed in grandeur, dignity, dramatic quality, and naturalness anything he had written before; it was produced in Vienna in 1762 with great success.  Among other operas in his \"grand\" manner were Alceste (1767) and Paride ed Elena (Paris and Helen, 1770) on texts by Calzabigi, Iphigenie en Aulide (Iphigenia in Aulis, 1774), and Armide (1777).  The operatic reforms inaugurated by Gluck met with violent opposition.  This opposition was particularly manifest in Paris, where from 1774 to 1781 a veritable war was waged between those who favored the reforms of Gluck and those who championed Italian opera and the Neapolitan operatic composer Niccolo Piccinni.  The director of the Paris Opera commissioned the two rivals each to compose an opera on the same text, Iphigenie en Tauride.  The Gluck version turned out to be his masterpiece.  Produced in Paris in 1779, it met with tremendous success (the Piccinni version produced in 1781, was judged inferior).  Gluck's reforms made a lasting mark on opera.  The principles for which he stood influenced the work of many composers who followed him, including Wolfgang Mozart, Luigi Cherubini, Ludwig van Beethoven, and Richard Wagner. ", "article_4": "Gluck, detail of a portrait by Joseph Duplessis, dated 1775 (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna ).  Christoph Willibald (von) Gluck (July 2, 1714 - November 15, 1787) was a German composer, one of the most important opera composers of the Classical music era, particularly remembered for Orfeo ed Euridice.  He is also remembered as the music teacher of Marie-Antoinette who as Queen of France promoted Gluck and was his patron.  Some regard him as the father of the Rococo and Classical age of music--at least in Opera.  Gluck's operatic reforms, eliminating all that was undramatic, were a turning point in the history of the medium.  Gluck lived during a time of political and social volatility with the advent of the French and American revolutions as well as the Napoleonic wars.  He was most affected by these massive historical changes and featured the dramatic in his operas as a way of speaking to the populace about human responsibility and personal and moral transformations.  Gluck would have agreed with the values as stated in the Universal Peace Federation which affirm taking responsibility for one's own personal, spiritual and moral transformation.  Early years Gluck was born in Erasbach (now a district of Berching, Bavaria) the first of nine children.  His father came from a long line of foresters; nothing is known about Gluck's mother, neither her ancestry nor her maiden name.  In 1717, the family moved to Bohemia, where the father became head forester in the service of Prince Philipp Hyazinth von Lobkowitz in 1727.  Little is known about Gluck's early years or his education.  Gluck later wrote: \"My father was a head forester in [Eisenberg] in Bohemia and he had brought me up to follow in his footsteps.  At that time music was all the rage.  Unfortunately, inflamed with a passion for this art, I soon made astounding progress and was able to play several instruments.  My whole being became obsessed with music and I left all thoughts of a forester's life behind. \" If Gluck's own account is to be believed, he ran away from home.  \"One fine day, with only a few 'groschen' in my pocket, I secretly left my parents' house and wandered. . . in a roundabout way towards Vienna.  I earned my food and lodging with my singing.  On Sundays and holidays I would play in the village churches. \" Gluck's memories of his youth are somewhat mistaken.  The first city he visited was not Vienna, but Prague, where in 1731 he studied logic and mathematics.  However, it is not known whether he finished a degree.  He was reconciled with his father, whose opposition to his son's musical vocation had driven him from home.  Gluck probably settled in Vienna before 1736.  From Vienna he traveled to Italy, probably arriving in Milan in 1737.  Italy He soon began to follow his true vocation, finding a place in the Milanese orchestra, where he got to know the inner workings of the opera house.  He was given lessons in composition by Giovanni Battista Sammartini and his works were soon enjoying successes on the Italian operatic stage.  His first opera Artaserse was performed on 26 December 1741, when Gluck was 27 years old.  This and the following works Gluck composed were conventional examples of opera seria.  Travels Gluck embarked on further journeys through Europe.  In London, La Caduta de' Giganti was performed on January 7, 1746, followed by Artamene on March 4.  Neither opera had much success.  In the same year Gluck published six trio sonatas, which had probably been written in Italy.  Gluck joined a traveling opera company led by Pietro Mingotti.  Such companies would visit towns without a permanent opera house.  The first of Gluck's operas known to have been played by Mingotti's troupe was performed at a double wedding for the ruling house of Saxony in Dresden on June 29, 1747.  For the birthday of Maria Theresa of Austria, the company staged La Semiramide riconosciuta (May 14, 1748).  The following year La contesa de' numi (April 9, 1749) appeared at the royal court in Copenhagen.  On September 15, 1750, Gluck married the 18-year old Maria Anna Bergin in the church of Saint Ulrich in Vienna.  Gluck was twice the age of his bride.  She was the well-off daughter of a Viennese businessman and brought a lot of money with her dowry, enabling Gluck to become economically independent.  Vienna Gluck finally settled in Vienna where he became Kapellmeister.  He wrote Le Cinesi for a festival in 1754 and La Danza for the birthday of the future Emperor Leopold II the following year.  After his opera Antigono was performed in Rome in February, 1756, Gluck was made a Knight of the Golden Spur by Pope Benedict XIV.  From that time on, Gluck used the title \"Ritter von Gluck\" or \"Chevalier de Gluck. \" Gluck turned his back on Italian opera seria and began to write opera comiques.  In 1761, Gluck produced the groundbreaking ballet Don Juan in collaboration with the choreographer Gasparo Angiolini.  The climax of Gluck's opera comique writing was La rencontre imprevueof 1764.  By that time, Gluck was already engaged in his operatic reforms.  Operatic reforms Gluck had long pondered the fundamental problem of form and content in opera.  He thought both of the main Italian operatic genres--opera buffa and opera seria--had strayed too far from what opera should really be.  They seemed unnatural, the singing in opera seria was devoted to superficial effects, the content was uninteresting and fossilised.  Opera buffa had long lost its original freshness, its jokes were threadbare, the repetition of the same characters made them seem no more than stereotypes.  In opera seria too, the singers were effectively absolute masters of the stage and the music, decorating the vocal lines so floridly that audiences could no longer recognize the original melody.  Gluck wanted to return opera to its origins, focusing on human drama and passions, and making words and music of equal importance.  In Vienna, Gluck met likeminded figures in the operatic world: Count Giacomo Durazzo, the head of the court theatre, who was a passionate admirer of French stage music; the librettist Ranieri de' Calzabigi, who wanted to attack the dominance of Metastasian opera seria; the innovative choreographer Gasparo Angiolini; and the London-trained castrato Gaetano Guadagni.  The first result of the new thinking was Gluck's reformist ballet Don Juan, but a more important work was soon to follow.  On October 5, 1762, Orfeo ed Euridice was given its first performance, with music by Gluck to words by Calzabigi.  The dances were arranged by Angiolini and the title role was taken by Guadagni.  Orfeo showed the beginnings of Gluck's reforms and the opera has never left the standard repertory.  Gluck's idea was to make the drama of the work more important than the star singers who performed it, and to do away with dry recitative which broke up the action.  The more flowing and dramatic style which resulted has been seen as a precursor to the music dramas of Richard Wagner.  Gluck and Calzabigi followed Orfeo with Alceste (1767) and Paride ed Elena (1770), pushing their innovations even further.  Calzabigi wrote a preface to Alceste, which Gluck signed, setting out the principles of their reforms.  Paris Gluck now began to spread his ideas to France.  Under the patronage of his former music pupil, Marie Antoinette, who had married the future French king Louis XVI in 1770, Gluck signed a contract for six stage works with the management of the Paris Opera.  He began with Iphigenie en Aulide (April 19, 1774).  The premiere sparked a huge controversy, almost a war, such as had not been seen in the city since the Querelle des Bouffons.  Gluck's opponents brought the leading Italian composer, Niccolo Piccinni, to Paris to demonstrate the superiority of Neapolitan opera and the \"whole town\" engaged in an argument between \"Gluckists\" and \"Piccinnists. \" The composers themselves took no part in the polemics, but when Piccinni was asked to set the libretto to Roland, on which Gluck was also known to be working, Gluck destroyed everything he had written up to that point.  On August 2, 1774, the French version of Orfeo ed Euridice was performed, with the title role transposed from the castrato to the tenor voice.  This time Gluck's work was better received by the Parisian public.  In the same year Gluck returned to Vienna where he was appointed composer to the imperial court.  Over the next few years the now internationally famous composer would travel back and forth between Paris and Vienna.  On April 23, 1776, the French version of Alceste was given.  Gluck also wrote Armide (1777), Iphigenie en Tauride (1779) and Echo et Narcisse for Paris.  During the rehearsals for Echo et Narcisse, Gluck suffered his first stroke.  Since the opera itself was a complete failure, Gluck decided to return to Vienna.  His musical heir in Paris was the Italian-Austrian composer Antonio Salieri, who had made friends with Gluck when he arrived in Vienna in 1767.  Gluck brought Salieri to Paris with him and bequeathed him the libretto for Les danaides.  The opera was announced as a collaboration between the two composers; however, after the overwhelming success of its premiere on April 26, 1784, Gluck revealed to the prestigious Journal de Paris that the work was wholly Salieri's.  Last years In Vienna Gluck wrote a few more minor works but he generally lived in retirement.  In 1781 he brought out a German version of Iphigenie en Tauride and other operas of his enjoyed great popularity in Vienna.  On November 15, 1787, in Vienna, Gluck suffered another stroke and died a few days later.  At a formal commemoration on April 8, 1788 his friend and pupil Salieri conducted Gluck's De profundis and a requiem by the Italian composer Jommelli was given.  Like many other prominent musicians and painters, Gluck was buried in the Matzleinsdorfer Friedhof.  When this cemetery was turned into a park in 1923, Gluck's remains were transferred to a tomb in the Vienna Zentralfriedhof.  Legacy Gluck's musical legacy included about 35 complete operas, together with numerous ballets and instrumental works.  His operatic reforms influenced Mozart, particularly his opera Idomeneo (1781).  Gluck left behind a flourishing school of disciples in Paris, who would dominate the French stage throughout the Revolutionary and Napoleonic period.  As well as Salieri, they included Sacchini, Cherubini, Mehul and Spontini.  Gluck's greatest French admirer would be Hector Berlioz, whose epic Les Troyens may be seen as the culmination of the Gluckian tradition.  Though Gluck wrote no operas in German, his example influenced the German school of opera, particularly Weber and Wagner, whose concept of music drama was not so far removed from Gluck's own.

He is best known for a minuet from his String Quintet in E, Op.  11, No.  5 (G 275), and the Cello Concerto in B flat major (G 482).  The latter work was long known in the heavily altered version by German cellist and prolific arranger Friedrich Grutzmacher, but has recently been restored to its original version.  Boccherini's output also includes several guitar quintets.  The final movement of the Guitar Quintet No.  4 in D (G 448) is a fandango, a lively Spanish dance. Monument to Luigi Boccherini, Lucca Boccherini was born into a musical family in Lucca, Italy in 1743. He was the third child of Leopoldo Boccherini, a cellist and double-bass player, and the brother of Giovanni Gastone Boccherini, a poet and dancer who wrote librettos for Antonio Salieri and Joseph Haydn. Luigi received his first music lessons at age five by his father, who taught him cello, and then continued his studies at age nine with Abbe Vanucci, music director of a local cathedral, at San Martino. When his son reached thirteen, Leopoldo Boccherini sent him to study in Rome with Giovanni Battista Costanzi. In 1757 Luigi Boccherini and his father both went to Vienna, where the court employed them as musicians in the Burgtheater.  In 1761 Boccherini went to Madrid, entering in 1770 the employ of Infante Luis Antonio of Spain (1727-1785), younger brother of King Charles III of Spain.  There, Boccherini flourished under royal patronage, until one day when the King expressed his disapproval at a passage in a new trio, and ordered Boccherini to change it.  The composer, no doubt irritated with this intrusion into his art, doubled the passage instead, which led to his immediate dismissal.  Then he accompanied Don Luis (the Infante) to Arenas de San Pedro, a little town in the Gredos Mountains in Avila; there and in the nearest town of Candeleda Boccherini wrote many of his most famous works.  Later patrons included the French ambassador to Spain, Lucien Bonaparte (1775-1840), as well as King Friedrich Wilhelm II of Prussia (1744-1797), himself an amateur cellist, flautist, and avid supporter of the arts.  Boccherini fell on hard times following the deaths of his Spanish patron (1785), his two wives (1785 and 1805), and his four daughters (1796, 1802 and 1804).  He died in Madrid in 1805, survived by two sons. His body lay buried in the Pontifical Basilica of St.  Michael in Madrid until 1927, when his remains were repatriated and buried in the church of San Francesco in his native Lucca. Much of Boccherini's chamber music follows models established by Joseph Haydn; however, Boccherini is often credited with improving Haydn's model of the string quartet by bringing the cello to prominence, whereas Haydn had frequently relegated it to an accompaniment role.  Some sources for Boccherini's style are in the works of a famous Italian cellist, Giovanni Battista Cirri, who was born before Boccherini and before Haydn, and in Spanish popular music.  A virtuoso cellist, Boccherini often played violin repertoire on the cello, at pitch, a skill he developed by substituting for ailing violinists while touring.  This supreme command of the instrument brought him much praise from his contemporaries (notably Pierre Baillot, Pierre Rode, and Bernhard Romberg), and is evident in the cello parts of his compositions (particularly in the quintets for two cellos, treated often as cello concertos with string quartet accompaniment).  He wrote a large amount of chamber music, including over one hundred string quintets for two violins, viola and two cellos (a type which he pioneered, in contrast with the then common scoring for two violins, two violas and one cello), a dozen guitar quintets, not all of which have survived, nearly a hundred string quartets, and a number of string trios and sonatas (including at least 19 for the cello).  His orchestral music includes around 30 symphonies and 12 virtuoso cello concertos.  In 1851, Louis Picquot wrote a biography of Boccherini and compiled a catalogue of his works. French musicologist Yves Gerard published the Gerard catalog in 1969, hence the \"G\" numbers applied to his output.  With a ministerial decree dated 27 April 2006, the Opera Omnia (complete works) of Boccherini was promoted to the status of Italian National Edition. [citation needed] Boccherini's style is characterized by Rococo charm, lightness, and optimism, and exhibits much melodic and rhythmic invention, coupled with frequent influences from the guitar tradition of his adopted country, Spain.

Notes and references  Notes References", "article_1": "Summary Read a brief summary of this topic Luigi Boccherini, in full Luigi Rodolfo Boccherini, (born February 19, 1743, Lucca [Italy]--died May 28, 1805, Madrid, Spain), Italian composer and cellist who influenced the development of the string quartet as a musical genre and who composed the first music for a quintet for strings, as well as a quintet for strings and piano.  His approximately 500 works also include sacred music, symphonies, and concerti.  Later life According to tradition, it was the Spanish ambassador to Paris who persuaded Boccherini to move (probably in 1768 or early 1769) to Madrid, where he began his long sojourn at the intrigue-ridden court of Charles III.  The kings brother, the infante Don Luis, conferred on him a yearly endowment of 30,000 reals as a cellist and composer.  Boccherini first began writing string quintets during this period, and he also wrote his well-known Six String Quartets, G 177-182 (1772).  At about the same time, he married Clementina Pelicho, with whom he had five children.  In 1785, when both Clementina and the infante died, the king granted him a pension of 12,000 reals, after which he was free to accept the patronage of (among others) Frederick William II of Prussia, who was an amateur cellist and well acquainted with Boccherinis music.  To his prodigious instrumental production, Boccherini added vocal compositions: the Stabat Mater, G 532 (1781), the zarzuela La Clementina, G 540 (1786), with libretto by Ramon de la Cruz, and the Christmas Villancicos, G 539 (1783).  Boccherini married Joaquina Porreti in 1787.  From 1787 to 1797 he may have been in Berlin, at a post provided by Frederick William II, although this position has not been adequately documented; it seems equally likely that he remained in Spain.  In 1798 the new king of Prussia refused to extend Boccherinis pension, the duchess of Osuna (another important source of income) moved to Paris, and Boccherinis financial distress was aggravated by poor health.  His life was further saddened by the death of two of his daughters in 1802 and the death of his second wife and a third daughter in 1804.  Reportedly, he was by then living in near poverty, although his financial plight may have been exaggerated.  Certainly, however, his own health suffered from his personal losses, and he died in 1805 of a long-standing respiratory ailment.  Legacy Yves Gerards Thematic, Bibliographical, and Critical Catalogue of the Works of Luigi Boccherini (1969) helped considerably to clarify long-standing confusions regarding the authenticity of Boccherinis musical legacy; the uncertainties were occasioned in part by Boccherinis lack of clarity in his own attempts to catalog his works and were compounded by the loss of much material during the Spanish Civil War (1936-39).  (Numbers preceded by \"G\" are the numbers assigned by Gerard according to type of composition, not chronological order. ) Boccherini was primarily a composer of chamber music, although his symphonies and concerti have considerable merit.  He produced more than 100 quintets, more than 100 quartets, more than 50 trios, and more than 50 chamber works in other forms.  Regrettably, his best-known work remains the Cello Concerto in B-flat, which was actually arranged from two Boccherini concerti and a sonata by the 19th-century composer and cellist Friedrich Grutzmacher.  Boccherinis well-known minuet is from his String Quintet in E Major, G 275.  Perhaps because his most significant work consists of chamber music and symphonies, Boccherini has often been compared to Haydn, usually to his disadvantage.  Like Vivaldi in relation to Bach, Boccherini is found wanting for the very qualities that established his fame as a composer: melodic fecundity, an emphasis on virtuosity (especially with respect to his own instrument, the cello), fairly undemanding forms, and a lack of the kind of thematic development that had become a hallmark of German music.  Thus, whereas Haydns first movements usually centre upon the closely reasoned argument of their development sections, Boccherinis depend on their thematic material and the way in which it is presented and re-presented.  Yet his treatment of instrumental texture was richly varied, emerging as one of the most characteristic features of his music, particularly in his concertante writing, in which he obtained a wide variety of tone colours by writing high viola or cello parts (he was clearly influenced here by his own instrumental facility).  His overriding concern was the production of smooth, elegant music; thus, his favourite expression marks were soave (soft), con grazia (with grace), and dolcissimo (very sweetly).  It is in his gentle warmth and superlative elegance--often with a hint of melancholy just below the surface--that Boccherinis most characteristic contribution may be found.

He was the third child of a double-bass player, Leopoldo Boccherini, and the brother of Giovanni Gastoni Boccherini, a notable poet and dancer who wrote librettos for Antonio Salieri and Joseph Haydn.  At an early age he was put under the care of the musical director of the local cathedral.  When he reached the age of 13, he was sent to Rome to study with the renowned cellist Giovanni Battista Costanzi, musical director at Saint Peters Basilica.  In Rome Boccherini was influenced by the polyphonic tradition (i. e. , music with two or more interweaving melodic parts) stemming from the works of Giovanni da Palestrina and from the instrumental music of Arcangelo Corelli.  In 1757 Boccherini and his father were invited to play in the Imperial Theatre orchestra in Vienna.  On his second journey to Vienna (1760), Boccherini, at 17, made his debut as a composer with his Six Trios for Two Violins and Cello, G 77-82.  During his third stay in that city (1764), a public concert by Boccherini was enthusiastically received.  In August 1764 he obtained a permanent position in Lucca with the local church and theatre orchestras.  He was in Lombardy in 1765, in the orchestra of Giovanni Battista Sammartini.  Through \"conversational\" style of the quartet: the cellos line was now as important as the counterpoint (i. e.  the intertwining of independent melodic lines) of the violin and viola.  Boccherini put together the first public string quartet performance, with an extraordinary string quartet made up of outstanding Tuscan virtuosos, including himself, Pietro Nardini, Nardinis pupil Filippo Manfredi, and Giuseppe Cambini.  After the death of his father (1766), Boccherini left Lucca for Paris, which was at that time particularly hospitable to Italian musicians.  The French publishers Grange, Venier, and Chevardiere published Boccherinis compositions of the previous years (Six String Quartets, G 159-164, and Six Duets for Two Violins, G 56-61, of 1761) as well as new ones (Six Trios for Two Violins and Cello, G 83-88, and Symphony in D Major, G 500, of 1766 and c.  1766?).  From Boccherinis contact with Madame Brillon de Jouy, the harpsichordist, came the Six Sonatas for Harpsichord and Violin, G 25-30.

The selection in this edition includes poems from Khairs two poetry collections of 2000 and 2010 as well as a new and unpublished poem.  The recurrent note in these poems is one of nostalgia and longing, of elegy and yearning.  And yet, this is not a monochromatic lyricism.  The understanding of memory and exile is finely calibrated to work on many levels.  There is the existential ache of the reed flute brutally uprooted from its origins in \"the leaf-layered, wind-voiced banks of the pond\".  There is another kind of pain in the cultural and spiritual amputation experienced by the little mermaid who trades the sovereignty of her voice for borrowed legs, aware that her past will never be understood, much less valued.  There is the melancholy song of the rootless koel, genetically deprived of the opportunity of nurturing the seeds of personal history and there is the tragedy of the surkhaab that prefers extinction to a life that cannot be shared.  And what makes this poetry work is Khairs craft, each line of his verse delicately poised, with a canny but understated understanding of the resonance and weight of words.  There is the burden of history and the terror of amnesia, the throb of memory and the violence of erasure, the pain of belonging and the desolation of unbelonging, in these poems.  There is the \"mud of language that turns doors to walls\" and truth to falsehood and there is the slippery inheritance of a rented language - \"the curse of consonants\" and \"the wobble of vowels\".  But there is also the \"slender sound\" of the reed flute, yoked to sorrow but also to joy, exiled and yet distantly aware of the memory of union, isolated and yet never incapable of song.

Mass is just over in the small village church of Verhny Zaprudy.  Andrey Andreyitch, a shopkeeper and an old inhabitant of the village, is angrily summoned by Father Gregory, still standing in his vestments by a door.  He thrusts a small note at Andrey, demanding, \"Was it you asked for prayers for the rest of Mariyas soul?\" In that small note is written, in big, \"staggering\" letters, \"For the rest of the soul of the servant of God, the harlot Mariya. \" Andrey readily acknowledges that he had sent the note.  Father Gregory is livid.  It turns out that, unlike what the reader might have suspected, Father Gregory is not angry at being asked to pray for a 'harlot.  He is angry because Mariya is Andrey Andreyitchs daughter.  How dare you write such a note, he asks? Andrey fails to understand.  For him, his daughter, who had become a well-known actress in Moscow, is a harlot in Biblical terms.  While using the word, harlot, Andrey is nevertheless praying sincerely for his dead daughter: \"But you know, the Lord in his mercy. . .  forgave this very thing. . .  forgave a harlot. . . ,\" he stutters in response.  Father Gregory, on the other hand, is angry because he feels that Andrey is judging his dead daughter, while God has already forgiven her.  He sees Andreys use of the word as a \"sin,\" an act of over-subtlety.  Father Gregory hectors Andrey, makes him do the penance of ten bows, and organises a requiem in Mariyas memory.  Andrey goes back to the pews and thinks of his last meeting with his daughter, a small girl he had not even noticed growing up into a young woman, so busy was he working as a lackey for the rich.  It is these rich people that, out of boredom, had taken the pretty and intelligent young girl in hand, and brought her up with lady-like graces, which had finally enabled her success as an actress.  Andrey thinks of how, three years before her death, Mariya had come to see him, her father.  Andrey had hardly recognised her.  A graceful young lady, she talked cleverly, \"as though from a book,\" and dressed elegantly.  Just before leaving, she had asked her father to accompany her for a walk along the river.  There she had spoken enthusiastically about the natural beauty of the riverside, while Andrey had remarked that the space was simply being wasted, not understanding his daughters enthusiasm.  Mariya had burst into tears, and \"she had cried and cried, drawing her breath greedily with her whole chest, as though she felt she had not a long time left to breathe. \" As the singing continues in the village church, Andrey shakes his head \"like a horse that has been bitten,\" to stifle painful memories.  Then he prays for his daughter: \"Be mindful, O Lord, of Thy departed servant, the harlot Mariya, and forgive her sins, voluntary or involuntary. . . \" He does not notice the \"unseemly\" word drop from his lips, for no exhortation from Father Gregory can drive out what is firmly embedded in his conscience.  The short story ends with a beautiful description, slow, sad and alive, of coils of smoke (\"like a childs curls\") drifting up from censor across a slanting patch of sunlight.  I hesitate to theorise about this story, just as I hesitate to theorise about any good work of literature.  I hesitate to bring in over-crusted terms, like 'perspective, 'generation or 'class, though in due course we all have to.  I feel like I am doing violence to the story if I even say, for instance, that the story is about the differences between Andrey and Father Gregory, and between Andrey and Mariya, both unsurmountable, both containing a degree of care and, in the case of the relationship between father and daughter, genuine love.  One of the reasons why I feel any statement like this does violence to the story is that the story itself never puts it in words.  Actually, the words in and of the story can be misleading: can a father who calls his daughter a 'harlot actually love her? But it is exactly, I would argue, because Chekov does not put this and other matters in words that we encounter them with a force that leaves us stunned.  And in this context, it is not insignificant that the story hinges around a note, which contains a word, harlot, that obviously carries the same and different meanings for Andrey and Father Gregory.  It is not as if both of them do not understand the dictionary meaning of the word harlot; they do.  Yet even the dictionary meaning of harlot, which they share, is not sufficient; the word has different associations for them; they relate differently to the person that the word has been attached to.  In this sense, they are like readers - not only do they approach the 'primary text from different perspectives, they also approach it with different experiences of the world and other texts.  As Charles E.  Bressler puts it, \"Our response to any text, then [. . . ] is largely a conditioned or socially constructed one; that is, how we arrive at meaning in fiction is in part determined by our past experience. \" But the matter is more complex than that.  For instance, it is significant that Chekov employs a word, 'harlot, whose meaning is largely clear and clearly shared by both Andrey and Father Gregory.  In the context of the story, it is not an 'ambiguous word.  It is not its meaning which is in question but its significance.  Let us pause and look at words again.  \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. \" We know that this is the first line of the Gospel of John in the Douay-Rheims, King James and other versions of the Bible.  This is a line that has spawned reams of interpretation, and my version is inevitably just one of them; I have no metaphysics in mind.  For me, the word is just the smallest unit of 'meaning known to humankind.  This might be controverted by those who would point out, rightly, that things can hold 'meaning even when they are not expressed in words.  For me, what they actually mean is that things can hold significance even when their meaning is not communicable.  Significance, even though it is defined as a synonym of 'meaning in dictionaries, comes from a different source: sign.  A sign is not a meaning but a gesture or a mark to convey a meaning.  The Latin 'signum stands for mark or token.  Meaning, on the other hand, comes from 'mean, which stresses understanding and communication: \"have in mind, intend, import. \" Its source word in Old English and Old Saxon (menian) stood for \"intend\" and \"make known. \" In other words, something can have significance without it being communicable, and something that is not communicable cannot be 'intended or 'made known.  If this appears to be a quibble, then let me rephrase my initial definition: the word is the smallest unit of verbal meaning.  But, as Chekov shows, the significance of the meaning of a word can vary from person to person, position to position.  If the 'word is seen as the smallest unit of verbal meaning, then the notion that the word was with God and that the word was God is a recognition of the fact that literature and God began as Siamese twins.  The unuttered utterance - the word with God - is seen as the source of creation: when God speaks it into being.  Although, this uttering of the word is also literature.  All religions have versions of this, and they subsequently insist on the fact that their revealed or sacred texts are the best of literature.  (Here, I am avoiding, in this essay, the matter of all known languages being, from an objective perspective, human constructs, and hence the 'revelations of God being, at best inevitably, a matter of translation, with all the dangers attendant on translation. ) But what happens to the 'word once it has been uttered, once it is no longer with God, once it is no longer God? Note that the following problems crop up even if we do not dismiss the existence of God - and, obviously, they are also there when we do.  The 'word, so to say, has entered the realm of humans, and (for the religious) it needs to be protected from human contamination.  In different ways, early religions have resisted the profane proliferation of their sacred texts.  This is not confined to just the trinity of Judaism, Christianity and Islam, with their 'revealed and written literatures.  Brahminical Hinduism even resisted the writing down of the earliest sacred texts, preferring the method of oral transmission from 'pure Brahmin to 'pure Brahmin.  It needed the anti-Brahminical revolutions of Buddhism and Jainism - largely artisanal and 'middle class/caste movements in their early years - to institute the written text as a mode of transmission.  This was probably not just because of their 'artisanal and 'merchant following (which implies some secular literacy and writing) and their suspicion of Brahminism, but also because their adherents were initially spread thinly over a large expanse and did not have the institutional network of Brahminical Hinduism.  In any case, even though they predate them by centuries in oral forms, major Brahminical Hindu texts are to be found only after the rise of Buddhism and Jainism.  It appears that Brahminical texts started being written down - and not transmitted orally - after the example and challenge of Buddhist and Jain texts, and even then the Brahminical preference for oral transmission continued for centuries, as embodied in the stress on 'shuddh uccharan etc.  However, lets face it: the overlap between literature and God slowly thins out as the 'word of God is crafted by not just the mouths of men, for mouths are more easily controlled, but also by their hands and eyes: the ability of the written word to escape imprisonment is legendary.  Though it is not just imprisonment that the written word can escape.  It can escape control - control over meanings.  This is not a new point: much of M. M.  Bakhtins relevance to the study of the novel rests on and develops from it.  Or, as the speaker in Tony Harrisons great elegy puts it, after seeing 'United (signifying a soccer team) sprayed on his parents gravestone in Leeds by a skinhead \"pissed on beer\": This pens all I have of magic wand.  I know this worlds so torn but want no other except for Dad whod hoped from 'the Beyond a better life than this one with my mother.  Though I dont believe in afterlife at all and know its cheating, its hard not to make a sort of furtive prayer from this skins scrawl, his UNITED means 'in Heaven for their sake, an accident of meaning to redeem an act intended as mere desecration and make the thoughtless spraying of his team apply to higher things, and to the nation.  (Harrison, V) Of course, this 'accident of meaning in Harrisons poem is possible only because the UNITED has been written down, as M.  M.  Bakhtin would have immediately noted.  Andrey and Father Gregory have an even more complicated (mis)understanding (over) of the word 'harlot, whose meaning is known to both .  Once again, it is a written word.  It is this gap that the written word introduces that enables the reader to go beyond the \"intention\" of the author, a matter that Roland Barthes would make much more of.  However, let us return, for the time being, to what we were tracing: the Siamese twin existence of literature and God in early history - or, even, prehistory - and the rise of that surgeon, Dr Writing.  Or should it be Professor Grammatology? Most people in the Western world are familiar with the history of the English Bible.  As the common version goes, John Wycliffe, an Oxford theologian and professor, produced the first hand-written English-language Bible manuscripts in the 1380s.  With the help of his assistants and supporters, he made various copies of these manuscripts, translated out of the Latin Vulgate, which was the only source text available to Wycliffe.  This so infuriated the Pope that, 44 years after Wycliffes death, he ordered the professors bones to be exhumed, crushed, and scattered in a river.  The Pope was not just angry at divergences in teaching; he was upset at the very act of translating the Bible out of Latin and into a spoken language.  Hence, when John Hus, one of Wycliffes most loyal followers, was burned at the stake in 1415, Wycliffes translated Bibles were used as kindling for the fire.  One aspect of this story - not by any means confined to the Christian tradition - pertains to the relationship of God to literature.  As Benedict Andersen points out in Imagined Communities, languages like Latin (or Arabic in the case of Islam, and Sanskrit in the case of Brahminical Hinduism) were not just equivalent systems of differential signs; they were considered divine languages.  In other words, the Bible, the Quran, the Vedas, the Gita etc.  were texts revealed in a special - sacred - language; translation, no matter how accurate, would distort the words of God.  If we put this conflict in the terms of our thesis, we can posit it as a debate between whether God creates literature, or literature (of a certain sort) creates God.  The untranslatability of the Bible (and similar sacred texts) is predicated on the priority of God: while God is expressed in the sacred literature, he precedes and exceeds the text.  Translations of sacred texts do not deny this relationship (Wycliffe was, in his own ways, just as devout as the Pope), but they insert a human agency that functions a bit like the ghost of doubt.  If sacred texts can be translated into another language, with the inevitable differences in nuance if not significance, then in the case of that translated text, surely, God has been demoted.  The shadow of human effort always falls between the original and its translation.  Actually, it falls between the 'revelation and its 'reception too, as any language, even a 'divine one, ceases to simply be a divine language in human mouths.  This problem, though, is easier to evade - in a manner similar to how iconoclastic religions, like Islam, can abolish representations (idols) of God as being human, but nevertheless need human attributes, or attributes that can only be understood in the human context, to talk about God (hence, for instance, the 99 'names of Allah in Islam, each of which is also a human definition or attribute).  The evasion of the issue of translation once a 'divine language is heard and spoken by humans becomes difficult to practice once the 'divine language is also translated into another 'human language.  Now, the text, as translation, comes before Gods intention, agency and words.  This is a logical doubt, and hence stronger than an intentional one: it was by no means the intention of Wycliffe or his followers to question the primacy of God.  No one, in the Christian world, really did so until the 18th century of Rousseau, and very few have actually done so since then, including today, despite sometimes considering themselves to be atheists.  But the incision had been made, intentionally or not.  It was also made in different yet similar ways in other cultures too: for instance, among the Falsifa and then the radical Sufis in the context of Islam; among religions/sects like Buddhism, Jainism and later the radical Bhakti singers in the context of Brahminical Hinduism (citations needed).  Over the years, this imperceptible incision would widen, as the Pope feared, though in other terms.  'God would continue to express himself through literature, but increasingly literature would be used to express 'God: Dantes Inferno, Miltons Paradise Lost or Iqbals Shikwa and Jawab-e-shikwa provide obvious aspects of this.  This develops in different ways over the centuries: For instance, Gauri Viswanathans convincing argument that the institutionalised teaching of English literature - as against the classics etc.  - began in the colonies as a compromise between Christian proselytising and secular administrative pragmatism.  So much more was to come, inevitably.  If God needed to be 'justified in literature, as Milton thought, literature could also critique, deny and even replace God.  William Blake felt that the devout Milton was unknowingly of the devils party, and for Blake it was a point in the blind bards favour.  Bertrand Russell argued in a literary essay that he was not a Christian.  However, does the refutation of God necessarily do away with God, even in literature? One is reminded of the 'God-shaped hole that Salman Rushdie mentions in one of his novels, and that many readers have filled with literature itself.  (This, again, is a matter that needs to be examined in detail, but it cannot be in this essay. ) However, in this essay, we can conclude by highlighting the trajectory of literature and God (or, if you wish, religious thought): how, having started off as conjoined twins, the two were gradually separated.  The contention over the 'spiritual and other meanings - or rather, significance - of the word, 'harlot in Chekovs story is also a reflection of this: Father Gregorys understanding and Andreys reading of the same word vary partly also because of the separation of the 'religious and the 'secular, though this is not an opposition in their case.  This separation was and is not always complete - various kinds of religious literature continued to be written, and continues to be written.  Moreover, the secular remains informed by the religious.  This is not new either.  Even literature that did not set out to be religious in an institutional manner was informed by the notion of the divine.  For example, following a basically Protestant suspicion of the institution of the Roman Catholic church, many Romantic poets and thinkers of the 18th century substituted the church with 'nature.  William Wordsworth, among others, highlighted this connection very often.  His poem, 'It is a Beauteous Evening, starts with a description of the evening, reminds the reader of the act of worship in a church in the very second line (\"The holy time is quiet as a Nun\"), evokes the \"the mighty Being\" that is \"awake\" and \"eternal,\" moves on to the innocent child who is naturally immersed in the place, and ends with: \"God being with thee when we know it not. \" The Romantic slippage from God in the church to 'God in Nature is an example that does not even need elaboration.  More ordinarily, when I moved to Denmark, I was amused by how many Danish (Protestant) families who would not attend church would religiously go for a family walk in 'nature on Sundays.  In short, the trajectory of literature is intertwined with and also strains against the career of God: it comes into existence as divine utterance or divinely inspired utterance, passes into various kinds of inspired utterances that, though ostensibly secular, are still informed by something like the divine spirit - be it Nature or the imagination - and also, inevitably, develops into an alternative kind of (human) utterance about the world and human realities.  God can hardly come into existence - and definitely not as institutionalised religion (for mystical options are always personal and subjective) - without words, organised words, written words, literature.  Yet literature, once it comes into existence and moves away from the divine utterance, takes over the concerns of religion too: words and the visible world, as well as all that might elude words and exist beyond the visible world.  Some friction is inevitable.  There needs to be space for this friction to be uttered, expressed, discussed and recorded.  Finally, it is in this necessary space that all versions of fascism - political or religious - are resisted.

Frontpage image: Isaac Levitan, Church in Plyos, 1888", "article_3": "\"The Thing About Thugs\" is an odd confection of a novel, set mostly in what looks like late-Victorian London.  The streets are gaslit.  The underworld teems with the flotsam of empire: lascars, Irishmen and so on, the undesirables of many nations.  The city is overwhelmed with crime and prostitution and an influx of immigrants.  Opium dens abound.  And a serial killer is on the loose.  Known as the \"head cannibal,\" he decapitates his victims after murdering them, but the heads are never found.  The Metropolitan Police are baffled, as they were by Jack the Ripper, active in 1888, who also desecrated the bodies of his victims.  Meanwhile, characters with names like One-Eyed Jack make shady deals in low taverns, and at the dinner tables of the upper classes Darwinian ideas are hotly debated.  It feels as if were in the disillusioned twilight of the 19th century, but our narrator -- or one of our narrators -- sitting in his grandfathers library \"surrounded by Dickens and Collins,\" claims that his story is set in 1837, the year Victoria ascended to the throne.  This is an anachronism.  But the author, Tabish Khair, seems to relish his plots liberation from the more rigorous conventions of historical fiction.  In his disregard for the proprieties, hes like some of the characters hes created in these bizarre but lively pages.  For in his plotting, he scavenges so much material from so many different sources that his book at times resembles Dr.  Frankensteins monster, its bits and pieces barely held together with coarse stitching.  It wont do.  Or, rather, it wouldnt do if not for the flashes of imaginative verve and insight that here and there illuminate the book and somehow keep it afloat.  A couple of serious ideas struggle to assert themselves, but halfheartedly.  The position of the colonial subject in the imperial city is one.  Another is the implicit claim that since every story is the product of other stories, a writer neednt be shackled to notions of verisimilitude, historical precision, plausibility or even coherence.  But if everything is possible then nothing really matters, and this is the risk Khair is running. "}}

Occom was the second Native American to publish his writings in English (after son-in-law Joseph Johnson (Mohegan/Brothertown) whose letter to Moses Paul, published April 1772, preceded Occom's by 6 months), the first Native American to write down his autobiography, and also helped found several settlements, including what ultimately became known as the Brothertown Indians.  Together with the missionary John Eliot, Occom became one of the foremost missionaries who cross-fertilised Native American communities with Christianized European culture. Born to Joshua Tomacham and his wife Sarah, Occom is believed to be a descendant of Uncas, the notable Mohegan chief.  According to his autobiography, at the age of 16 or 17, Occom heard the teachings of Christian evangelical preachers in the Great Awakening.  He began to study theology at the \"Lattin School\" of Congregational minister Eleazar Wheelock in 1743 and stayed for four years until leaving to begin his own career.  In addition to improving his English, Occom learned to read and speak Latin, Greek, and Hebrew.  As a young man, the only book he owned was the Bible.  From 1747 until 1749, Occom worked under and studied with the Reverend Solomon Williams in New London, Connecticut. Occom became a teacher, preacher, and judge among the Montaukett Native Americans in Montauk, eastern Long Island, and married Mary Fowler, a Montaukett woman. Occom helped some of the Pequot peoples he worked with assimilate and adopt European-style houses, dress and culture.  He was officially ordained a minister on August 30, 1759, by the presbytery of Suffolk. Occom was never paid the same salary as white preachers, although promised he would be.  The Society in Scotland for Propagating Christian Knowledge also gave Occom a stipend for some time, but he lived in deep poverty for much of his life.  In 1761 and 1763, Occom traveled to the Six Nations of the Iroquois in upstate New York to preach.  Winning few converts, he returned to teach at Mohegan, Connecticut, near New London. Occom mediated the conflicts between the colonists and the Native Americans because he was very familiar with colonist culture and through Occom's missionary work he was recognized as a leader that strengthened Native American relations. Wheelock had meanwhile established an Indian charity school in Lebanon, Connecticut in 1754 with a legacy from Joshua Moor (among others).  Upon Occom's return to Mohegan, Wheelock persuaded his former pupil to travel to England to raise money for the school.  Occom sailed from Boston December 23, 1765 and did not return until May 20, 1768.  He preached his way across Britain from February 16, 1766, to July 22, 1767, delivering between 300 and 400 sermons, drawing large crowds wherever he went, and raising over PS12,000 for Wheelock's project.  King George III donated 200 pounds, and William Legge, Earl of Dartmouth, subscribed 50 guineas.  However, Occom on his return learned that Wheelock had failed to care for Occom's wife and children while he was away.  Furthermore, Wheelock moved to New Hampshire and used the funds raised to establish Dartmouth College (named after the English earl) for the education of the sons of American colonists, rather than Native Americans as had originally been promised to Occom.  Even 200 years later, the college had graduated less than 20 Native American students. In 1764, Occom opposed the sale of tribal lands and was involved in the \"Mason Controversy,\" a long lasting dispute over land between the colonists and the Mohegeans.  The Mohegans formed an alliance with the Mason family to plead a case for the governor of Connecticut to give back the lands to the Mohegans.  When Occom came back to Mohegans, he expressed his support for the Mason family and the Mohegans which caused the missionaries to make threats like taking away his preacher's license and to stop financing his missionary work.  The colonists also started to spread bad rumors about Occom, especially about how he was an alcoholic and how he converted to Christianity just for show. In a 1769 letter, Wheelock wrote to Occom about a rumor about Occom being an alcoholic.  The rumor hurt Occom's reputation after Occom's success in fundraising money in England.  Wheelock suggested that Occom truly does not care for Christianity.  The stereotype of the drunk Indian was put onto Occom and undermined his missionary work.  Wheelock benefited from the defamation of Occom as Wheelock got back his authority.  Wheelock's letter further put forth the concept of fake conversion onto Occom and that Occom was not to be trusted as a preacher. In 1768, Occom wrote A Short Narrative of My Life, a ten-page manuscript now held in Dartmouth College's archive collection; however, it was not published until 1982. The document expands upon a single-page biography that Occom wrote before his preaching tour of England and Scotland. Occom also published Sermon at the Execution of Moses Paul and A Choice Collection of Hymns and Spiritual Songs in 1774.  All of these documents provide a very different perspective on the relations between colonists and Native Americans from Mary Rowlandson's narrative of her captivity in similar areas a century earlier. Upon his return from England, Occom lived with his Mohegan people.  After Wheelock's betrayal, Occom together with son-in-law Joseph Johnson, brothers-in-law David and Jacob Fowler, and others, worked to organize the Christian (or \"praying\") Indians of New England and Long Island into a new tribe in Upstate New York.  On October 4, 1774, the Oneida ceded land to the East Coast Indians and by 1775, the initial group had begun to migrate.  Burnt out at the outset of the Revolution, many went to Massachusetts to live among the Stockbridge until their return in 1785.  Occom, his son-in-law Joseph Johnson (who had been a messenger for General George Washington during the American Revolution), and his Montauk brother-in-law David Fowler led the people back to rebuild their settlement (near what is now Waterville, New York) called Brothertown.  The Oneida also invited other Christian Indians to live with them, namely the Stockbridge Mohican from land claimed by western Massachusetts and two Lenape groups from the southern New Jersey area.  The Mohicans founded what they called New Stockbridge in New York, near Oneida Lake. Occom not only assured that these villages received official civil charters in 1787, but also evicted white settlers from Brothertown on April 12, 1792. Occom died on July 14, 1792, in New Stockbridge.  He is said to be buried just off Bogusville Hill Road outside of Deansboro, New York. After Occom's death, during the 1820s, many Brothertown Indians and some Oneida accepted payment from New York State for their land and were removed to what is now known as the town of Brothertown in Calumet County, Wisconsin.  In the modern era, the Brothertown Indians petitioned the federal government for recognition as a tribe, but were denied and have appealed. In World War II, the United States liberty ship SS Samson Occom was named in his honor.  Several locations around Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, are named after Occom, including Occom Pond and Occom Ridge on the college campus's northern edge. The Native American Studies program has a Samson Occom professorship. The Occom Commons community space is part of Goldstein Hall in the recently opened McLaughlin Residential Cluster.  Eastern Connecticut State University in Willimantic, Connecticut, also named a residence hall for upperclassmen after Occom.  The Norwich, Connecticut neighborhood of Occum is named for Samson Occom.  The Brothertown Indians celebrate Samson Occom Day as an official Tribal holiday every July 14.  http://brothertownindians. org/image/cache/OccomDayRes. pdf On April 27, 2019, the Native American Alumni Association of Dartmouth College erected a memorial on the site of Moor's Charity School in Columbia, CT, \"commemorating and honoring Samson Occom for his contributions to the education of Native Americans and the founding of Dartmouth College. \" Memorial to Samson Occom, Moor's Charity School, Columbia, CT Works of Samson Occom  A Choice Collection of Hymns and Spiritual Songs , New London, Connecticut: Press of Thomas and Samual Green, 1774.  , New London, Connecticut: Press of Thomas and Samual Green, 1774.

Occom's popularity as an eloquent teacher and spiritual leader grew with Indians over a large part of New England.  To accommodate this interest, he decided to form a New England Christian Indian School.  The church sent him to England to raise funds, where he collected eleven thousand pounds from wealthy patrons, such as the Earl of Dartmouth and King George.  When he returned however, he found his family destitute and his school moved to Hanover, New Hampshire, where it became Dartmouth College.  This disappointment was followed by the Connecticut Colony's ruling that the Mohegans would not be compensated for land they sold to the colony.  The colony then backed an unpopular candidate for Mohegan Sachemship.  This led the Mohegans to decide that no Sachem was better than a colonial puppet.  With the Tribe increasingly penniless and powerless, Occom accepted an invitation for his group to resettle with the upstate New York Oneida.  He hoped their new home in Brothertown, New York would free them from additional disappointment.  His legacy for the Mohegan people who remained in Connecticut was a reputation for being Christianized, which helped them avoid later relocation.  In April of 2022, Dartmouth College agreed to return Occoms papers to the Mohegan Tribe.  These papers include some of the earliest examples of written Mohegan Language, an autobiography, letters, and journals. ", "article_2": "Samson Occom, 1723-1792 Samson Occom was a member of the Mohegan tribe of east-central Connecticut and believed to be a direct descendant of its great chief Uncas.  He was born near present-day New London in 1723, and was converted to Christianity at age eighteen during the Great Awakening.  At twenty, he went to study for four years at the Lebanon, Connecticut, home of Congregational minister Eleazar Wheelock.  Occom was a remarkable student, and became one of the first Native writers published in the colonies, while always maintaining his identity as a Mohegan and his commitment to the welfare of Native peoples in the Northeast.  For the next twelve years, he served as an effective educator to the Montauk Indians of Long Island, and was ordained a Presbyterian minister in 1759.  When he returned to Mohegan, he became an eloquent and popular spiritual leader and teacher, also supporting the Mohegan Tribes lawsuits against the Colony of Connecticut, which threatened to take ownership of ancestral lands.  Occom also supported the efforts of Moors Indian Charity School to educate Native children from the region, traveling across England and Scotland from 1766-68, preaching to rapt audiences, meeting leading figures, and raising money for the school.  Upon his return, though, he was disappointed to find the school relocated to a royal grant in New Hampshire and renamed Dartmouth College, which the funds he raised helped to establish.  Occom then became an outspoken advocate for Indian rights, a conviction reinforced by the decision in 1773 of the Mason Land Case against the Mohegan Tribe.  To address the Mohegan Tribes poverty and powerlessness, Occom helped found Brothertown, formed from various tribes, which eventually settled in Oneida country in upstate New York.  Occom moved there with his family in 1789, leaving a portion of the Mohegan Tribe in Connecticut.  Occom died in 1792 in New Stockbridge, New York.  As the Mohegan Tribal website concludes: \"His legacy for the Mohegan people who remained in Connecticut was a reputation for being Christianized, which helped them avoid later relocation. \"", "article_3": "Dartmouth to return Samson Occoms possessions to Mohegan Tribe One of the documents includes what is believed to be the oldest sample of the Mohegan Tribes written language.  by Arizbeth Rojas | by Abigail Salzhauer / The Dartmouth On April 27, a repatriation ceremony will take place at the Mohegan Cultural and Preservation Center in Connecticut for the College to return the Samson Occom papers, which include diaries and autobiographical statements belonging to Occom -- a co-founder of Dartmouth -- to his native Mohegan Tribe.  Part of the significance of the documents lies in their linguistic information and history.  According to College archivist Peter Carini, among the 117 documents and two books in the collection, there is a primer that contains what is believed to be the oldest example of the Mohegan Tribes written language.  According to Mohegan Tribal Council vice chairwoman Sarah Harris 00, the last fluent speaker of the Mohegan language passed away in 1908, at a time when many Mohegans had stopped teaching the language out of fear of \"retribution\" from local teachers.  Harris wrote in an emailed statement that the Mohegan Language Project plans to use the primer substantively as a teaching tool towards the Mohegan language revitalization efforts.  The Occom papers are currently housed in an underground storage facility between the back of Rauner Library and the east wing of Baker Library.  According to Harris, the return of the Occom papers is particularly meaningful for the Mohegan Tribe because the Mogehan people believe that objects and writing hold their makers spirit within them.  \"With the return of his papers, Occom is coming back to our homelands and our people,\" Harris wrote.  Taught by Eleazar Wheelock, Occom was considered a remarkable student by any standard, according to Native American studies professor Colin Calloway.  Calloway said it was this experience that prompted Wheelock to found Dartmouth College with the initial intention of educating Native American youth.  According to Carini, by assisting the Mohegan Tribe with legal documents and fighting for their land rights, Occom hoped to use his education to support his homeland.  However, according to Calloway, in Dec.  1765, Occom traveled to England to raise money for what he believed would become a school for Native Americans which instead became Dartmouth College -- \"another school basically for white students,\" Calloway said.  Before returning in 1767, Occom had raised roughly 2 million pounds in todays money, Carini said.  Then, in 1777, Occom wrote a \"scathing\" letter to Wheelock regarding Wheelocks broken promise to care for Occoms family while Occom was away and repurposing of the collected funds to create a college that served sons of New Englanders, Carini said.  According to Calloway, in the letter, Occom said that Dartmouth should not be considered an alma mater, but instead an \"alba mater\" -- a white mother.  Carini said that Occom never saw Wheelock ever again and never set foot on Dartmouth College.  \"Im encouraged by [the repatriation] because it is a step in the right direction,\" Calloway said.  \"It is an important first step towards restoring a relationship that was severely damaged a very long time ago. \" Carini said that staff from the Colleges libraries and the Hood Museum of Art attended workshops with the Mohegan Tribal Librarian and Tantaquidgeon Museum to better understand how to collaborate with Indigenous communities, as well as Occoms role in the founding of Dartmouth.  According to Carini, members from administrative offices such as the admissions office were also invited to these workshops.  \"We think [they] could benefit from better understanding of the story and the background and how to work with indigenous people a little bit more,\" he said.  According to Carini, the College is also \"in conversation\" with members of the Abenaki Tribe -- the land of whom the College was built on -- in Odanak, Quebec concerning tribal materials still held by the College.  The process for any items to be repatriated has yet to be determined.  One factor in determining what items should be repatriated is the question of how the item was originally sourced and if it was bought or stolen, Carini said.  According to Carini, \"a lot\" of materials held by the Hood museum were originally sold by members of the Abenaki.  \"The Mohegan [repatriation] came up very quickly and we reacted to it but we want to prepare ourselves before we field any additional requests because there need to be some internal protocols in place for us to judge when it is most appropriate to return items,\" Carini said.  In regards to repatriating the Occom papers to the Mohegan Tribe, Carini said that he is \"really excited. \" \"Its very rare in my job that we get to have an opportunity to return [such documents] in such a direct way and in a way that starts taking some steps toward correcting harms from the past and creating reconciliation,\" he said.  Harris shared Carinis optimism.  \"This repatriation marks the beginning of a new chapter in the shared history of the Mohegan People and the Dartmouth community, one in which Occoms dream of an education for Native students moves closer to fulfillment,\" she wrote. ", "article_4": "Occom, Samson (1723-1792) Native American pastor and missionary Occom was born at Mohegan, Connecticut, and became a Christian in his youth.  He was the first Indian trained by Eleazar Wheelock at his school in Lebanon, Connecticut, which later became Dartmouth College.  In 1749 he moved to eastern Long Island to be teacher and pastor to the Montauk people.  His success there led to his ordination by the Long Island Presbytery in 1759, even though he lacked theological education.  Occom made two mission trips to the Oneida Indians in upstate New York, and in 1765, a trip to England with Nathaniel Whitaker to raise funds for Wheelocks school.  He made a great impression in England and with Whitaker raised over PS12,000.  After his return he became an itinerant preacher to the New England Indians and was sometimes in poverty.  He was a leader in resisting the encroachments by whites on Indian lands, which made him unpopular in Connecticut.  He also took a lead in securing lands for the settlement of New England Indians among the Oneida, who were far from white influence.  In 1785, when Brothertown was established in Oneida territory, he became its pastor and remained there the rest of his life.  He was a great orator who gave little attention to doctrine but much to rules of conduct.  He composed a number of hymns and published a hymn collection that went through three editions.

Hanlon 77 set to lead a delegation to Connecticut next week to return the papers of Samson Occom to his Mohegan homeland, more attention is being paid to a leading figure in the founding of Dartmouth.  Born in 1723, Occom was a scholar who spoke several languages and an ordained Presbyterian minister who traveled to Great Britain in 1766 to help raise money for a school for Native American youth envisioned by the Rev.  Eleazar Wheelock.  Though Occom was fantastically successful--he raised more than PS12,000, including support through the Society in Scotland for Propagating Christian Knowledge--Wheelock veered from the original mission, and Occom never set foot at the school that became Dartmouth.  Still, as Colin Calloway, the John Kimball Jr.  1943 Professor of History and a professor of Native American and Indigenous Studies, describes, Occom was an essential figure in the establishment of the school and could even be considered Dartmouths \"first development officer. \" \"It wouldnt have happened without Samson Occom,\" he says. ", "article_6": "Click here for the text of this historical document.  In 1765, when Phillis Wheatley was about eleven years old, she wrote a letter to Reverend Samson Occum, a Mohegan Indian and an ordained Presbyterian minister.  Despite the difference in their ages (Occum was born in 1723), Wheatley's letter apparently led to a friendship with Occum, who was also a poet, and who later published an Indian hymnal.  On February 11, 1774, Wheatley wrote Occum again, to comment on an indictment of slave-holding Christian ministers that he had written.  Wheatley strongly concurred with the argument put forth by Occum, writing that she was \"greatly satisfied with your Reasons representing the Negroes\" and thought \"highly reasonable what you offer in Vindication of their natural Rights. \" While she implored God's deliverance from \"those whose Avarice impels them. . . \" she hastened to add, \"This I desire not for their Hurt, but to convince them of the strange Absurdity of their Conduct whose Words and Actions are so diametrically opposite. \" As she did in several of her poems, notably her ode to the Earl of Dartmouth, Wheatley used the letter to Occum as an occasion to point out the contradiction between the colonists' demands for freedom from Britain and their determination to uphold slavery.  She wrote, \"How well the Cry for Liberty, and the reverse Disposition for the Exercise of oppressive Power over others agree -- I humbly think it does not require the Penetration of a Philosopher to determine. \" previous | next"}}

For other uses, see Sverdlov (disambiguation) Yakov Mikhailovich Sverdlov (Russian: Iakov Mikhailovich Sverdlov; 3 June [O.  S.  22 May]] 1885 - 16 March 1919) was a Bolshevik Party administrator and chairman of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee from 1917 to 1919.  He is sometimes regarded as the first head of state of the Soviet Union, although it was not established until 1922, three years after his death.  Born in Nizhny Novgorod to a Jewish family active in revolutionary politics, Sverdlov joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in 1902 and supported Vladimir Lenin's Bolshevik faction during an ideological split.  He was active in the Urals during the failed Revolution of 1905, and in the next decade, he was subjected to constant imprisonment and exile.  After the 1917 February Revolution overthrew the monarchy, Sverdlov returned to Petrograd and was appointed chairman of the Party Secretariat.  In that capacity, he played a key role in planning of the October Revolution.  Sverdlov was elected chairman of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee in November 1917.  He worked to consolidate Bolshevik control of the new regime and supported the Red Terror campaign and the decossackization policies.  He is also considered to have played a major role in authorising the execution of the Romanov family in July 1918.  Sverdlov died in March 1919 during the Spanish flu at the age of 33 and was buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis.  The city of Yekaterinburg was renamed Sverdlovsk in 1924 in his honour. Yakov Sverdlov in 1904 Sverdlov was born in Nizhny Novgorod as Yakov-Aaron Mikhailovich Sverdlov to Jewish parents, Mikhail Izrailevich Sverdlov and Elizaveta Solomonova.  His father was a politically active engraver who produced forged documents and stored arms for the revolutionary underground.  The Sverdlov family had six children: two daughters (Sophia and Sara) and four sons (Zinovy, Yakov, Veniamin, and Lev).  After his wife's death in 1900, Mikhail converted with his family to the Russian Orthodox Church, married Maria Aleksandrovna Kormiltseva, and had two more sons, Herman and Alexander.  Sverdlov's father was sympathetic to his children's socialist tendencies and 5 out of his 6 children would become involved in revolutionary politics at some point.  Mikhail watched as his household slowly became a revolutionary hotspot, where the Novgorod Social Democrats would meet, write pamphlets, and even forge stamps for false passports.  Yakov's eldest brother Zinovy was adopted by Maxim Gorky, who was a frequent guest at the house.  Zinovy was the only Sverdlov to reject revolutionary politics and had little to no contact with Yakov after the revolution. Yakov excelled at school, and after 4 years in gymnasium left to become a pharmacist's apprentice and a \"professional revolutionary,\" Sverdlov joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in 1902, and then later the Bolshevik faction, supporting Vladimir Lenin.  In his youth, Sverdlov became friends with a fellow revolutionary Vladimir Lubotsky (later known as Zagorsky).  He was involved in the 1905 revolution while living in the Ural Mountains.  Though never actually attending college, Sverdlov adopted the garb of the radical students at the time - \"With his medium height, unruly brown hair, glasses continually perched on his nose, and Tolstoy shirt worn under his jacket, Sverdlov looked like a student, and for us. . . a student meant a revolutionary. \" Sverdlov became a major activist and speaker in Nizhny Novgorod.  In 1906, Sverdlov was arrested and held in the Yekaterinburg prison until his release.  During his time in prison, Sverdlov continued to educate himself and others, reading Lenin, Marx, Kautsky, Heine, and more.  Sverdlov attempted to live by the motto: \"I put books to the test of life, and life to the test of books. \" For most of the time from his arrest in June 1906 until 1917 he was either imprisoned or exiled.  In March 1911, Sverdlov was held in the St.  Petersburg House of Pretrial Detention.  Sverdlov married, a second time, with Bolshevik party member and meteorologist named Klavdia Novgorodtseva.  In 1911, their first child, Andrei Yakovlevich Sverdlov, was born.  In 1913, their second child, Vera, was born and in 1915 Klavdia joined Yakov in exile in the village of Monastyrskoe.  Sverdlov and his wife ran a Bolshevik reading circle in the town, which, though illegal, escaped the notice of the local authorities.  During the period 1914-1916 he was in internal exile in Turukhansk, Siberia, along with Joseph Stalin (then known as Dzhugashvili).  Both had been betrayed by the Okhrana agent Roman Malinovsky.  Of Stalin, Sverdlov wrote \"The comrade I was with turned out to be such a person, socially, that we didn't talk or see each other.  It was terrible. \" Like Stalin, he was co-opted in absentia to the 1912 Prague Conference.  In 1914, Sverdlov moved to a different village, moving in with his friend Filipp Goloshchyokin, known as Georges.  In early 1917, Sverdlov received news of the Putilov strike of 1917 in Petrograd.  Alongside Goloshchyokin, he set out at once, arriving to Petrograd on 29 March 1917. After the 1917 February Revolution Sverdlov returned to Petrograd from exile as head of the Urals Delegation and found his way into Lenin's inner circle.  He first met Lenin in April 1917 and subsequently usurped Elena Stasova as the chairman of the Central Committee Secretariat, and became the secretary of the Central Committee of the Party.  According to Podvoisky, the chairperson of the Military Revolutionary Committee, \"The person who did more than anyone to help Lenin with the practicalities of translating convictions into votes was Sverdlov. \" As chairman of the Central Committee, Yakov played an important role in planning the October Revolution and helped make the decision to stage an armed uprising.  In November as the Bolsheviks debated whether to postpone or hold elections, Sverdlov advocated for immediate elections as promised.  When the results came back showing that the Socialist Revolutionaries had won, Sverdlov, Lenin, and Bukharin dissolved the assembly, leading to a civil war. Sverdlov is sometimes regarded as the first head of state of the Soviet Union, although it was not established until 1922, three years after his death.  Sverdlov had a prodigious memory and was able to retain the names and details of fellow revolutionaries in exile.  He promoted his friend and suite-mate Varlam Avanesov to second-in-command at the Central Executive Committee, and would later become a top official of the secret police.  He also installed Vladimir Volodarsky as commissar of print, propaganda, and agitation until his assassination in 1918.  His organizational capability was well-regarded, and during his chairmanship, thousands of local party committees were initiated.  One of his comrades recalled that, [He] could tell you everything you needed to know about a comrade: where he was working, what kind of person he was, what he was good at, and what job he should be assigned to in the interests of the cause and for his benefit.  Moreover, Sverdlov had a very precise impression of all the comrades: they were so firmly stamped in his memory that he could tell you all about the company each one kept.  It is hard to believe, but true. Sverdlov was elected chairman of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee in November 1917, of which his wife was also a part, becoming thereby de jure head of state of the Russian SFSR until his death.  He played important roles in the decision in January 1918 to end the Russian Constituent Assembly and the subsequent signing on 3 March of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk.  In March 1918 Sverdlov along with most prominent Bolsheviks fled Petrograd and moved the government headquarters to Moscow - the Sverdlovs moved into a room in the Kremlin. In March 1918, Sverdlov and the Central Executive Committee discussed how to best remove the \"ulcers that socialism has inherited from capitalism\" and Yakov advocated for a concentrated effort to turn the poorest peasants in the villages against their kulak brethren.  Alongside Bukharin, the party began a campaign of \"concentrated violence\" against many members of the landowning, capitalist, and tradesman classes of Russian society. A number of sources claim that Sverdlov, alongside Lenin and Goloshchyokin, played a major role in the execution of Tsar Nicholas II and his family on 17 July 1918.  A book written in 1990 by the Moscow playwright Edvard Radzinsky claims that Sverdlov ordered their execution on 16 July 1918.  This book and other Radzinsky books were characterized as \"folk history\" by journalists and academic historians. However Yuri Slezkine in his book The Jewish Century expressed a slightly different opinion: \"Early in the Civil War, in June 1918, Lenin ordered the killing of Nicholas II and his family.  Among the men entrusted with carrying out the orders were Sverdlov, Filipp Goloshchyokin and Yakov Yurovsky\". The 1922 book by a White Army general, Mikhail Diterikhs, The Murder of the Tsar's Family and members of the House of Romanov in the Urals, sought to portray the murder of the royal family as a Jewish plot against Russia.  It referred to Sverdlov by his Jewish nickname \"Yankel\" and to Goloshchekin as \"Isaac\".  This book in turn was based on an account by one Nikolai Sokolov, special investigator for the Omsk regional court, whom Diterikhs assigned with the task of investigating the disappearance of the Romanovs while serving as regional governor under the White regime during the Russian Civil War. The investigating magistrate in Ekaterinburg in 1918 saw the signed telegraphic instructions to execute the Imperial Family came from Sverdlov.  These details were published in 1966. According to Leon Trotsky's diaries, after returning from the front (of the Russian Civil War) he had the following dialogue with Sverdlov: My next visit to Moscow took place after the [temporary] fall of Ekaterinburg [to anti-Communist forces].  Speaking with Sverdlov, I asked in passing: \"Oh yes, and where is the Tsar?\" \"Finished,\" he replied.  \"He has been shot. \" \"And where is the family?\" \"The family along with him. \" \"All of them?,\" I asked, apparently with a trace of surprise.  \"All of them,\" replied Sverdlov.  \"What about it?\" He was waiting to see my reaction.  I made no reply.  \"And who made the decision?,\" I asked.  \"We decided it here.  Ilyich believed that we shouldn't leave the Whites a live banner to rally around, especially under the present difficult circumstances. \" I asked no further questions and considered the matter closed. Following the assassination of Moisei Uritsky and the assassination attempt on Lenin in August 1918, Sverdlov drafted a document that called for \"merciless mass terror against all the enemies of the revolution\". Under his and Lenin's leadership, the Central Executive Committee adopted Sverdlov's resolution calling for \"mass red terror against the bourgeoisie and its agents. \" During Lenin's recovery Sverdlov moved into Lenin's office in the Kremlin and took over some of Lenin's official obligations.  He oversaw the interrogation of Lenin's would-be assassin, Fanny Kaplan, and even moved Kaplan from the Cheka headquarters to be held in a basement room underneath Sverdlov's apartment.  Sverdlov's deputy Avanesov gave the order for Kaplan's execution and Sverdlov himself personally ordered that the body be \"destroyed without a trace. \" Sverdlov supported the Red Terror campaign, specifically when it came to the policy of decossackization that was started in 1917 as a part of the Russian Civil War.  This policy resulted in the deaths of thousands of Cossacks, while the Soviet government confiscated land and food produced by the Cossack population.  Sverdlov wrote that \"not a single crime against the revolutionary military spirit will remain unpunished,\" and that the release of Cossack prisoners was unacceptable. This policy was temporarily suspended in March 1919 while Sverdlov was in Ukraine overseeing the election of the Ukrainian Communist Party's central committee. Snow-covered statue of Sverdlov in Yekaterinburg , formerly Sverdlovsk There are various theories on how he died and none can be proven officially such as poisoning, beating or flu.  He is most commonly attributed to have died of either typhus or more likely the Spanish flu, after a political visit to the Ukraine and Oryol.  Kremlin doctors diagnosed him with the Spanish flu.  Even as his illness progressed, he continued to perform his duties as chairman of the Central Committee.  On 14 March 1919 Sverdlov lost consciousness and on the 16th he died at the age of 33. He is buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis in Moscow.  Today his grave is one of the twelve individual tombs located between the Lenin Mausoleum and the Kremlin wall.  He was succeeded in an interim capacity by Mikhail Vladimirsky, and eventually by Mikhail Kalinin as Chairman of the Central Executive Committee, and by Elena Stasova as Chairwoman of the Secretariat.

This is only a few of the false names and pseudonyms used by Yakov Sverdlov during his underground revolutionary activity in various parts of Russia at the beginning of the 20th century.  At the age of 32 he was one of the key figures behind the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution.  He was a close ally of Vladimir Lenin and until 1919 he was the official head of the Russian Soviet Federal Socialist Republic.  \"Defending\" the working class Yakov Sverdlov was born in 1885 in the city of Nizhny Novgorod into the family of a Jewish engraver.  The family lived from hand to mouth.  Yakovs father Mikhail (or Moishe, as they called him) took a second underground job forging various documents and stamps for revolutionaries to pay for his childrens education.  His forgeries were so good the police could never tell one of his fakes from the real article.  On April 30, 1896, at the age of 11, Sverdlov was admitted into the first grade of the Nizhny Novgorod Provincial Gymnasium.  Yakovs relationship with his teachers was far from perfect.  Many times he protested against the school regulations, which irritated many of his tutors.  Eventually tiring of the combative Sverdlov, they expelled him after finishing only five grades.  His young age notwithstanding, Yakov developed an intense desire to devote all his energy to defending the rights of the working class.  After he was expelled from school, Sverdlov found work as an apprentice in a pharmacists shop in the township of Kanavin near Nizhny Novgorod.  The town was the site of a big lumberyard and a huge number of workers.  There Yakov came into contact with workers who always shared stories about the hardships of their everyday life, and Sverdlov eventually spoke to his father about his revolutionary ideas.  By that time, the home of the Sverdlovs in Nizhny Novgorod was used as a hiding-place for visiting revolutionaries, and the half-century old idea of toppling the monarchy was gaining popularity in the region.  Later on Yakovs father began to sell illegal literature and even arms.  In 1902 Sverdlov joined the Russian Social Democratic Workers Party.  He distributed social-democratic literature and raised funds for party needs.  In addition, he set up an underground printing press.  In 1903, when the party was divided into the moderate Mensheviks and more radical Bolsheviks, Sverdlov decided to join the Bolshevik faction.  From then on, he always displayed his ardent support for Vladimir Lenin.  Sverdlov took part in the 1905 Russian Revolution.  By that time he had been placed in charge of several Bolshevik organizations in the Ural Mountains region.  During that period he developed a reputation as one of the party's leading public speakers.  The same year he and his wife Elizaveta Schmidt had their daughter, Elena.  Arrest, exile, and a bit of freedom Yakov Sverdlov, 1904 Yakov Sverdlov, 1904 In 1906 Sverdlov was arrested for his illegal activity for the first time.  This was the beginning of a period of time from 1906 until 1917 when he was mostly either imprisoned or exiled.  All in all, Sverdlov was arrested 14 times.  During his first years in prison, Sverdlov was allowed time to read and educate himself.  He also tried to plan various escapes, occasionally succeeding.  During one of his periods on the run, he married his second wife Klavdia Novgorodtseva, who bore him two children and stayed with Sverdlov until the end of his days.  During one of his successful escapes in 1912, he managed to get to St.  Petersburg, where he became a member of the Bolshevik Party Central Committee.  However, in 1913 Sverdlovs whereabouts were discovered by police agent Roman Malinovsky.  Yakov was exiled to Turukhansk in Eastern Siberia.  For three years he shared his flat with another exiled revolutionary, Joseph Stalin, the future notorious Soviet ruler.  At the beginning of their time together, both of them were quite tolerant of each other.  But later on, their relationship became significantly strained, and they often had quarrels.  Yakov, in spite of the poverty he experienced during his youth, was brought up in the traditions of the Russian intelligentsia, and found Stalins manners lacking.  For example, Sverdlov would wash his dishes after every meal, but Stalin did not bother to, occasionally giving his plate to his dog to lick it clean.  Additionally irksome was that Stalins dog was called Yashka, a diminutive nickname for Yakov.  Revolutionary years After the 1917 February Revolution, Sverdlov returned to the capital which at that time had been renamed Petrograd.  He took an active part in the propaganda campaign against Russias participation in WWI, the Bolsheviks calling the conflict \"imperialistic\".  In April, Sverdlov went to the Urals to oversee the party activity in the city of Ekaterinburg.  He returned to Petrograd in June and he was a key figure in organizing the subversive activities of Vladimir Lenin against the provisional government.  As of August 1917, Sverdlov controlled the organizational bureau of the Central Committee and its secretariat.  Along with Felix Dzerzhinsky, he was the head of the Central Committee's military commission.  In Lenin's absence, it was Sverdlov who presided at the Central Committee meetings.  In all critical circumstances Sverdlov displayed unquestionable loyalty to Lenin.  In the fall of 1917, it was Yakov Sverdlov who was responsible for the so-called \"workflow of the Revolution\".  At the beginning of October he personally recruited people for the revolutionary committee.  Close to the day of the Bolshevik Revolution, he supervised the actions of the Russian Provisional Government members (On the first day of the uprising they were arrested in their residence in the Winter Palace).  After the Bolsheviks had taken power, at the assembly of the Second Congress of the Soviets, Sverdlov was elected Chairman of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee.  He personally supervised the process of sending telegrams all over the country with the news that the Bolsheviks had taken power in Russia.  At the time, Sverdlov was the official head of the country, but in reality he always took orders from Lenin.  However, he saved Lenin several times, as there were moments when Sverdlov was the only member of the Central Committee to support the mastermind of the revolution, and all the deputies only later took his side.  In January 1918, Sverdlov played an important role in persuading the Bolshevik leaders to support the closure of the Russian Parliament, a constituent assembly that represented various political parties.  He led the campaign to create the peace treaty admitting Russias defeat in World War I, known as the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk.  Many eyewitnesses said that Lenin merely put forward theories of the revolution, leaving Sverdlov to apply them in practice.  He supported acts of violence against those loyal to the Tsar, a policy later known as \"The Red Terror\".  Some modern historians, journalists, and investigators managed to obtain documents proving it was Yakov Sverdlov behind the execution of the royal family that took place near the city of Ekaterinburg on July 16, 1918.  Death and aftermath Yakov Sverdlov Yakov Sverdlov There are still many versions of Sverdlovs mysterious death on March, 16, 1919.  Some researchers are sure that he died of influenza which he caught in the city of Oryol on one of his business trips.  Others say that he died of tuberculosis (that was Stalins version, which suited him because it portrayed Sverdlov as a martyr who caught the dangerous disease in exile).  According to a third version, he was heavily hit by a worker at a Moscow factory.  Many historians however tend to believe that his death was not linked to illness, despite the fact that his health was failing.  It was only after his death that Stalin, the person who had a negative relationship with Sverdlov during their time in exile in Siberia, began to rise to the highest echelons of power.  At Sverdlovs funeral, held in the Necropolis close to the Kremlin wall, Lenin spoke for 2 hours about key issues every revolutionary had to keep in mind.  He realized that he had lost his biggest ally in the power struggle within Bolshevik circles.  In 1924 the city of Ekaterinburg was renamed into Sverdlovsk.  In 1991, Russian President Boris Yelstin who was born in that part of the country returned the citys original name.  However, to this day the region around Ekaterinburg is still called the \"Sverdlovsk region\".  Written by Oleg Dmitriev, RT", "article_2": "As part of the commemoration of the centenary of the October Revolution in 1917, the World Socialist Web Site is publishing a series of profiles of leaders of the Russian Revolution.  We are publishing here a portrait written by Leon Trotsky of Yakov Sverdlov, the chief organizer of the Bolshevik Party in 1917 and first president of the Soviet Republic.  The article originally appeared in 1925 and was translated into English by the American Trotskyist John G.  Wright.  It was published in Vol.  7, No.  11, of the Fourth International journal in 1946.  What follows is an edited version of this translation prepared by the World Socialist Web Site, together with the original introduction from the Fourth International journal.  Introduction (from the Fourth International journal, 1946) We are reprinting, on this 29th Anniversary of the Russian Revolution, Trotskys brief sketch of the great Sverdlov, the incomparable Bolshevik organizer.  It is well to acquaint our readers with this heroic figure, who epitomized the type of revolutionist who made possible the 1917 revolution and the subsequent victory over the counter-revolution.  Yakov Mikhailovich Sverdlov was born in the city of Nizhny Novgorod on June 3, 1885.  His father, an engraver, was able to give his children an education beyond the reach of working-class families in Czarist Russia.  As a boy of ten, young Yakov was enrolled in a gymnasium (equivalent to high school) where he studied for five years.  At the age of 15, he left school to work in a drug store.  The next year, that is 1901, the first revolutionary underground committee in Nizhny Novgorod was organized.  This same year, Sverdlov, at the age of 16, joined the revolutionary movement.  Despite his extreme youth, he came quickly to the forefront, serving in his period of underground activity as a leading figure in virtually all the regions of Russia.  When the split occurred in the Russian movement in 1903, Sverdlov adhered to the Bolsheviks, in whose ranks he remained to the day of his death.  In 1905, during his assignment in the Urals, he organized and led the Soviet of Workers Deputies there.  Like all the underground workers of his day he spent many long years in prison and Tsarist exile.  His first arrest came in 1903.  In 1906, after the defeat of the 1905 revolution, he spent 18 months in jail and then served a two-year penitentiary term.  A whole series of arrests, jailings, exiles, and escapes followed.  In the autumn of 1913, at the Poronin Conference of the Bolsheviks, he was co-opted in his absence (he was in exile at the time) to the Central Committee of the Party.  When the February 1917 revolution broke out, Sverdlov was in exile in the polar regions of Siberia, from where he came at once to Petrograd.  At the April 1917 Conference, he was elected to the Central Committee.  At the Second Soviet Congress, he was elected Chairman of the All-Union Soviet Executive Committee.  He combined his work as President of the Soviet Republic with the onerous responsibilities of \"organizer-in-chief\" of the Bolshevik Party to the day of his untimely death at the age of 34.  Little is now known about this superb organizer of Bolshevism.  Layer upon layer of Stalinist distortions and falsifications have encrusted his memory.  Official Kremlin mythology has not merely assigned to Stalin most of the role and functions that Sverdlov fulfilled in the October Revolution and in the Civil War period but has sought to depict Sverdlov in Stalins image.  But Sverdlov as organizer was the polar opposite of Stalin.  Trotsky later drew the following contrast between Sverdlov and Stalin \"as types of organizers\": Up to the spring of 1919, the chief organizer of the Party had been Sverdlov.  He did not have the name of General Secretary, a name which was then not yet invented, but he was that in reality.  Sverdlov died at the age of 34 in March 1919, from the so-called Spanish fever.  In the spread of the civil war and the epidemic, mowing people down right and left, the Party hardly realized the weight of this loss.  In two funeral speeches, Lenin gave an appraisal of Sverdlov which throws a reflected but very clear light also upon his later relations with Stalin.  \"In the course of our revolution, in its victories,\" Lenin said, \"it fell to Sverdlov to express more fully and more wholly than anybody else the very essence of the proletarian revolution. \" Sverdlov was \"before all and above all an organizer.  From a modest underground worker, neither theoretician nor writer, there grew up in a short time an organizer who acquired irreproachable authority, an organizer of the whole Soviet power in Russia, and an organizer of the work of the Party unique in his understanding. \" Lenin had no taste for the exaggerations of anniversary or funeral panegyrics.  His appraisal of Sverdlov was at the same time a characterization of the task of the organizer: \"Only thanks to the fact that we had such an organizer as Sverdlov were we able in war times to work as though we had not one single conflict worth speaking of. \" So it was in fact.  In conversations with Lenin in those days we remarked more than once, and with ever renewed satisfaction, one of the chief conditions of our success: the unity and solidarity of the governing group.  In spite of the dreadful pressure of events and difficulties, the novelty of the problems, and sharp practical disagreements occasionally bursting out, the work proceeded with extraordinary smoothness and friendliness, and without interruptions.  With a brief word, we would recall episodes of the old revolutions.  \"No, it is better with us. \" \"This alone guarantees our victory. \" The solidarity of the center had been prepared by the whole history of Bolshevism and was kept up by the unquestioned authority of the leaders, and above all of Lenin.  But in the inner mechanics of this unexampled unanimity, the chief technician had been Sverdlov.  The secret of his art was simple: to be guided by the interests of the cause and that only.  No one of the Party workers had any fear of intrigues creeping down from the Party staff.  The basis of this authority of Sverdlovs was loyalty.  Having tested out mentally all the Party leaders, Lenin in his funeral speech drew the practical conclusion: \"Such a man we can never replace, if by replacement we mean the possibility of finding one comrade combining such qualities . . .  The work which he did alone can now be accomplished only by a whole group of men who, following in his footsteps, will carry on his service. \" These words were not rhetorical, but a strictly practical proposal.  And the proposal was carried out.  Instead of a single Secretary, there was appointed a collegium of three persons.  From these words of Lenin, it is evident, even to those unacquainted with the history of the Party, that during the life of Sverdlov, Stalin played no leading role in the Party machinery - either at the time of the October Revolution or in the period of laying the foundations and walls of the Soviet state.  Stalin was also not included in the first Secretariat which replaced Sverdlov.  Yakov Sverdlov (by Leon Trotsky, 1925) I became acquainted with Sverdlov only in 1917 at a session of the Bolshevik fraction of the First Soviet Congress.  Sverdlov was presiding.  In those days there were hardly any in the party who guessed the true stature of this remarkable man.  But within the next few months, he was to unfold himself fully.  In the initial period after the revolution the emigres, that is, those who had spent many years abroad, could still be told apart from the \"domestic\" and \"native\" Bolsheviks.  In many respects, the emigres possessed serious advantages because of their European experience, the broader outlook connected with the latter, and also because they had generalized theoretically the experience of past factional struggles.  Naturally, this division into emigres and non-emigres was purely temporary and eventually it disappeared.  But in 1917 and in 1918 it was in many cases something very palpable.  However, there was no \"provincialism\" to be sensed in Sverdlov even in those days.  Month by month he grew and became stronger so naturally, so organically, so seemingly without effort, so much in step with events and in such constant touch and collaboration with Vladimir Ilyich [Lenin] that to a superficial view it might have seemed that Sverdlov had been born an accomplished revolutionary \"statesman\" of the first rank.  All questions of the revolution he approached not from above, that is, not from the standpoint of general theoretical considerations, but rather from below, through the direct impulses of life itself as transmitted by the Party organization.  When new political questions were under discussion, it might have seemed sometimes that Sverdlov - especially if he kept silent which was not infrequently the case - was wavering or had not yet made up his mind.  In reality, in the course of the discussion, he was engaged in mentally working out the problem along parallel lines, which might be sketched out as follows: Who is available? Where should he be assigned? How shall we broach the problem and bring it in harmony with our other tasks? And no sooner had the joint political decision been reached, no sooner was it necessary to turn to the organizational side of the problem and the question of personnel than it almost invariably turned out that Sverdlov was already prepared with far-reaching practical proposals, based on his encyclopedic memory and personal acquaintance with people.  In the initial stages of their formation, all the Soviet departments and institutions turned to him for personnel; and this initial and rough allocation of party cadres demanded exceptional resourcefulness and inventiveness.  It was impossible to depend on an established apparatus, on files, archives, etc.  For all this was still in an extremely nebulous shape, and at any rate provided no direct means of verifying to what extent the professional revolutionist Ivanov may be qualified to head a particular Soviet department, of which only the name was as yet in existence.  A special psychologic intuition was required to decide such a question: one had to locate in Ivanovs past two or three focal points and thence draw conclusions for an entirely new situation.  Meanwhile, these transplantations had to be made in the most diversified fields in a search for a Peoples Commissar, or for a manager of the Izvestiia printing plant [the central organ of the Petrograd Soviet], or for a member of the Central Committee of the Soviets, or for a commandant of the Kremlin, and so on ad infinitum.  These organizational problems arose, naturally, without any consecutiveness whatever, that is, never from the highest post down to the lowest or vice versa, but in every which way, accidentally, chaotically.  Sverdlov made inquiries, gathered or remembered biographical details, made phone calls, offered recommendations, gave out assignments, made appointments.  At the present time, I am at a loss to say exactly in what capacity he performed all this work, that is, just what his formal powers were.  But at all events, a considerable part of this work had to be performed on his own personal responsibility - with the support, naturally, of Vladimir Ilyich.  And no one ever challenged it, because such were the exigencies of the entire situation at the time.  Sverdlov accomplished a considerable part of his organizational work as Chairman of the All-Union Soviet Executive Committee, utilizing the members of this Executive for various appointments and for particular assignments.  \"Talk it over with Sverdlov,\" Lenin would advise in many cases whenever someone turned to him with a particular problem.  \"I must talk it over with Sverdlov,\" would say a new-baked Soviet \"dignitary\" to himself whenever he hit a snag with his collaborators.  One of the ways to solve a major practical problem was--according to the unwritten constitution--\"to talk it over with Sverdlov. \" But Sverdlov himself, of course, did not at all favor this personalized method.  On the contrary, his entire work prepared the conditions for a more systematic and regularized solution of all Party and Soviet problems.  In those days the need was for \"pioneers\" in all spheres, that is, people capable of operating on their own two feet amid the greatest chaos, in the absence of precedents, without any statutes and regulations.  It was for such pioneers for all conceivable exigencies that Sverdlov was constantly on the lookout.  He would recall, as I have already said, this or that biographical detail, of how so and so had conducted himself at such and such a time, and from this, he would adduce whether or not this or that candidate would be suitable.  There were, of course, many mistakes.  But the astonishing thing is that there were not many more.  And what seems most astonishing is how Sverdlov found it possible to even broach a problem in the face of the chaos of tasks, the chaos of difficulties and with a minimum of available personnel.  It was much clearer and easier to approach each problem from the standpoint of principle and political expediency than to approach it from the organizational standpoint.  This situation is to be observed among us to this very day, flowing, as it does, from the very essence of a period that is transitional to socialism.  But in those days the discrepancy between a clearly envisaged goal and the lack of material and human resources made itself felt much more acutely than today.  It was precisely when matters came to the point of practical solution that many of us would start shaking our heads in perplexity.  And then someone would ask: \"Well, and what do you say, Yakov Mikhailovich?\" And Sverdlov would offer his solution.  In his opinion \"the undertaking was quite feasible. \" A group of carefully selected Bolsheviks would have to be sent; and they should be properly briefed, and given the proper connections, and proper attention paid, and the necessary aid given--and it could be done.  To gain successes on this path one must be completely imbued with confidence that it was possible to solve any task and to overcome any difficulty.  An inexhaustible reserve of active optimism did indeed supply the subsoil for Sverdlovs work.  Naturally, this does not mean to say that each problem was in this way solved 100 percent.  If it was solved 10 percent, that was good.  In those days this already meant salvation because it made tomorrow secure.  But after all, this was precisely the gist of all the work during those initial and hardest years: it was necessary to get food supplies somehow; it was necessary to equip and train the troops somehow; it was necessary to keep the transport functioning somehow; it was necessary to cope with the typhus somehow--no matter what the price the revolution had to be secured its tomorrow.  The Best Type of Bolshevik Sverdlovs qualities became strikingly revealed in the most critical moments, for example, after the July Days in the year 1917, that is, after the White Guardists had crushed our Party in Petrograd; and again, during the July days in the year 1918, that is, after the Left Social Revolutionists staged their insurrection.  In both cases it was necessary to rebuild the organization, to renew connections or create them over again, checking up on those who had passed a great test.  And in both cases, Sverdlov was irreplaceable with his revolutionary calm, his far-sightedness, and his resourcefulness.  On another occasion, I have told the story of how Sverdlov came from the Bolshoi Theater, from the Soviet Congress to the cabinet of Vladimir Ilyich at the very \"peak\" of the Left SR uprising.  After greeting us with a smile he said, \"Well, I suppose we shall again have to move from the Sovnarkom (Council of People's Commissars) to the Revkom (Revolutionary Military Council). \" Sverdlov remained himself, as he usually was.  In such days one really learns to know people.  And Yakov Mikhailovich was truly beyond compare: confident, courageous, firm, resourceful--the best type of Bolshevik.  It was precisely in those critical months that Lenin came to know and to appreciate Sverdlov.  Time and again it happened that Vladimir Ilyich would pick up the phone in order to propose to Sverdlov a particular emergency measure and in most cases the answer he got was \"Already. \" This meant that the measure had already been adopted.  We often made jokes on this topic, saying, \"Well, in all likelihood, Sverdlov has it--already. \" \"You know,\" Lenin once remarked, \"in the beginning, we were against including him on the Central Committee.  How we underestimated the man! There was a considerable dispute over it, but the rank and file corrected us at the Convention, and they proved to be entirely correct. \" Despite the fact that there never was, of course, even talk of intermixing the organizations, the bloc with the Left SRs did unquestionably tend to make the conduct of our Party nuclei somewhat nebulous.  Suffice it to mention, for example, that when a large group of activists was detailed to the Eastern front, simultaneously with the appointment of Muraviev as commander-in-chief of that area, a Left SR was elected the secretary of this group of several score, even though most of them were Bolsheviks.  In the various institutions and departments, the greater was the number of new and accidental members of our own Party all the more indefinite were the relations between the Bolsheviks and the SRs.  The laxness, the lack of vigilance and of cohesion among Party members only recently implanted in the still fresh state apparatus are characterized quite strikingly by the single fact that the basic core of the uprising was constituted by the Left SR organization among the Cheka troops.  The salutary change occurred literally within two or three days.  During the days of the insurrection engineered by one ruling party against another, when all personal relations were suddenly put in question, and when the functionaries in the departments began wavering, then the best and the most devoted Communist elements within all sorts of institutions quickly drew close to one another, breaking all ties with the Left SRs and combatting them.  The Communist nuclei became fused in the factories and in the army sections.  In the development of the Party and the State alike, this was a moment of exceptional importance.  Party elements, distributed and in part dispersed throughout the still formless framework of the state apparatus and whose Party ties had become to a large extent diffused in departmental relations, now came instantly to the fore, closed ranks and became welded together under the blows of the Left SR insurrection.  Everywhere Communist nuclei took shape which assumed in those days the actual leadership of the internal life of all the institutions.  One may say that it was precisely in those days that the Party in its majority became for the first time really conscious of its role as a ruling organization, as the leader of the proletarian state, as the party of the proletarian dictatorship not only in its political but also in its organizational aspects.  This process--which might be designated as the beginning of the partys organizational self-determination within the Soviet State apparatus created by the Party itself took place under the direct leadership of Sverdlov, irrespective of whether involved was the All-Union Soviet Executive Committee or a garage of the War Commissariat.  Historians of the October Revolution will be obliged to single out and minutely study this critical moment in the evolution of the reciprocal relations between the Party and the State, a moment that was to place its stamp on the entire period to come, down to this very day.  Therewith the historian who takes up this question will lay bare the great role played by Sverdlov, the organizer, during this all-important turning point.  All the threads of practical connections were gathered in his hands.  Even more critical were the days when the Czechoslovaks threatened Nizhny Novgorod, while Lenin was struck down, with two SR bullets in his body.  On September 1, at Svyazhsk I received a coded telegram from Sverdlov: \"Return immediately.  Ilyich wounded.  How critically not known.  Complete calm prevails.  Sverdlov.  August 31, 1918. \" I left immediately for Moscow.  The Party circles in Moscow were in a stern, somber but unwavering mood.  The best expression of this unwaveringness was Sverdlov.  His responsibilities and his role increased manifold in those days.  The highest tension could be sensed in his nervous body.  But this nervous tension meant only a greater vigilance--it had nothing in common with aimless bustling, and all the less so with jitteriness.  During such moments Sverdlov made his stature felt completely.  The diagnosis of the physicians was hopeful.  No visitors were allowed to see Lenin; no one was admitted.  There was no reason to remain in Moscow.  Shortly after my return to Svyazhsk, I received a letter from Sverdlov dated September 8: \"Dear Lev Davidovich, I take this opportunity to write a few words.  Things are going well with Vladimir Ilyich.  I shall probably be able to see him in three or four days. \" The rest of the letter deals with practical questions which it is unnecessary to bring up here.  Engraved sharply in my memory is the trip to the little town of Gorki where Vladimir Ilyich convalesced from his wounds.  It was on my next trip to Moscow.  Despite the terribly difficult situation there was strongly to be felt at the time a change for the better.  At the Eastern front, which was then the decisive one, we had recaptured Kazan and Simbirsk.  The attempt on Lenins life served the Party as a supreme political overhauling: the Party felt more vigilant, more on guard, better prepared to beat back the enemy.  Lenin was improving rapidly and making preparation to return to work soon.  All this together engendered moods of strength and assurance.  Since the Party had been able to cope with the situation up until now, it would surely continue to do so in the future.  This was exactly our mood as we made the journey to Gorki.  En route, Sverdlov acquainted me with what had happened in Moscow during my absence.  He had an excellent memory as is the case with most individuals who have a strong creative will.  His account revolved, as always, around the axis of the most important things that had to be done, with the necessary organizational particulars, accompanied in passing, with brief characterizations of individuals.  In brief, it was an extension of Sverdlovs customary work.  And beneath it all was to be felt the undercurrent of confidence, calm and at the same time overpowering: \"Spravimsia [well manage]!\" An Imperious Chairman Sverdlov had to preside a great deal.  He was chairman of many bodies and at many meetings.  He was an imperious chairman.  Not in the sense that he shut off discussion, or curbed the speakers, and so on.  Not at all.  On the contrary, he never quibbled or insisted on formalities.  His imperiousness as chairman consisted in this, that he always knew exactly what practical decision was before the body; he understood who would speak, what would be said, and why; he was quite familiar with the backstage aspects of the issue - and every big and complex issue has its own backstage; he was adept at giving the floor in time to speakers who were needed; he knew how to put the proposition to a vote in time; he knew what could be carried and he was able to carry what he wanted.  These traits of his as chairman were bound up indissolubly with all his qualities as a practical leader, with his ability to appraise people in the flesh, realistically, with his inexhaustible inventiveness in the field of organizational and personnel combinations.  During stormy sessions he was adept at permitting the assembly to become noisy and let off steam; and then at the proper moment, he would intervene to restore order with a firm hand and a metallic voice.  Sverdlov was of medium height, of dark complexion, very thin and gaunt; his face, lean; his features, angular.  His powerful and even mighty voice might have seemed out of consonance with his physique.  To an even greater degree, this might be said of his character.  But such an impression could be only fleeting.  And then the physical image became fused with the spiritual.  Nor is this all, for this gaunt figure with its calm unconquerable and inflexible will and with its powerful but not flexible voice, would then stand forth as a finished image.  \"Nichevo [no problem],\" Vladimir Ilyich would sometimes say in a difficult situation.  \"Sverdlov will tell them about it in his Sverdlovian bass and the matter will be settled . . . \" In these words, there was affectionate irony.  In the initial post-October period the Communists were, as is well-known, called \"leatherites\" by our enemies, because of the way in which we dressed.  I believe that Sverdlovs example played a major role in introducing the leather \"uniform\" among us.  At all events, he invariably walked around encased in leather from head to toe, from his leather cap to his leather boots.  This costume, which somehow corresponded with the character of those days, radiated far and wide from him, as the central organizational figure.  Comrades who knew Sverdlov in the underground days remember a different Sverdlov.  But in my memory, Sverdlov remains clothed in leather as in an armor grown black under the blows of the first years of the Civil War.  We were gathered at a session of the Political Bureau when Sverdlov, who was burning up with fever at home, took a turn for the worse.  E. D.  Stassova, who was then the Secretary of the Central Committee, came in during the session.  She had come from Sverdlovs apartment.  Her face was unrecognizable.  \"Yakov Mikhailovich feels poorly, very poorly,\" she said.  A glance at her sufficed to understand that there was no hope.  We cut the session short.  Vladimir Ilyich went to Sverdlovs apartment, and I left for the Commissariat to prepare to depart immediately to the front.  In about 15 minutes a phone call came from Lenin, who said in that special muted voice which meant great strain: \"He is gone. \"--\"He is gone?\"--\"He is gone. \" For a while, each of us held the receiver in our hands and each could feel the silence at the other end.  Then we hung up.  There was nothing more to say.  Yakov Mikhailovich was gone.  Sverdlov was no longer among us.  March 13, 1925 Endnotes (by the WSWS): The insurrection by the Left SRs: The general dissatisfaction of the Left SRs with the policies of the Bolsheviks, most notably the conclusion of the Peace Treaty of Brest Litovsk, eventually resulted in an open insurrection in Moscow on July 6, 1918.  The assassination of the German ambassador Graf Mirbach, carried out on behalf of the SR Central Committee by Ya.  Bliumkin and N.  Andreyev, signaled the start of the insurrection.  See Trotskys \"On Lenin,\" written in the same year.  Muraviev was a lieutenant colonel in the army who sympathized with the Left SRs during the epoch of Kerensky (Kerenshchina).  In the initial days of the October Revolution, he performed an important service to Soviet power in his capacity as a commander of the armed forces.  In July 1918, he gave the treacherous order to withdraw units from the Eastern Front and march on Moscow.  The armed forces did not support him, and Muraviev shot himself. ", "article_3": "Yakov Sverdlov was a Bolshevik party leader and chairman of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee.  Sverdlov was born in Nizhny Novgorod as Yakov Mikhailovich Sverdlov to Jewish parents Mikhail Izrailevich Sverdlov and Elizaveta Solomonova.  His father was a politically active engraver who eventually went into forgery, and arms storage and dealing partially to support his family.  The Sverdlov family had six children: two daughters (Sophia and Sara) and four sons (Zinovy, Yakov, Veniamin, and Lev).  After his wife's death in 1900, Mikhail converted his family to the Russian Orthodox Church, married Maria Aleksandrovna Kormiltsev, and had two more sons, Herman and Alexander.  Yakov's eldest brother Zinovy was adopted by Maxim Gorky, who was a frequent guest at the house.  Yakov Sverdlov joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in 1902, and then the Bolshevik faction, supporting Vladimir Lenin.  He was involved in the 1905 revolution.  After four years of high school, he became a prominent underground activist and speaker in Nizhny Novgorod.  For most of the time from his arrest in June 1906 until 1917 he was either imprisoned or exiled.  During the period 1914-1916 he was in internal exile in Turukhansk, Siberia, along with Joseph Stalin.  After the 1917 February Revolution he returned to Petrograd from exile and was re-elected to the Central Committee.  He played an important role in planning the October Revolution.  A close ally of Lenin, Sverdlov played an important role in the controversial decisions to close down the Constituent Assembly and to sign the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk.  It was claimed that Lenin provided the theories and Sverdlov made sure they worked.  Later their relationship suffered as Lenin appeared to be too theoretical for practical Sverdlov.  He is sometimes referred to as the first head of state of the Soviet Union but this is not correct since the Soviet Union came into existence in 1922, three years after Sverdlov's death.  However, as chairman of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee (VTsIK) he was the de jure head of state of the Russian SFSR from shortly after the October Revolution until the time of his death.  A number of sources claim that Sverdlov played a leading role in the execution of Tsar Nicholas II and his family.  An official version is that Sverdlov died of influenza in Oryol during the 1918 flu pandemic, while returning to Moscow from Kharkiv during one of his political trips and got a flu during one of his outdoor speeches.  He is buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis, in Moscow.  Another version is that he died of tuberculosis.  Historian Arkadi Waksberg claimed that there were reliable rumours that Sverdlov was beaten to death by workers in Oryol, due to his Jewish origins, and that the incident was covered up to prevent an anti-semitic outburst.  Another speculation is that he was eliminated due to his involvement in an attempt to assassinate Lenin.  In 1924, Yekaterinburg was renamed Sverdlovsk in his honor.  In 1991, Sverdlovsk was changed back to Yekaterinburg.  His son Andrei had a long career as an officer for the Soviet security organs (NKVD, OGPU).  His niece Ida married NKVD chief Genrikh Yagoda. ", "article_4": "Yakov Sverdlov Yakov Sverdlov, the son of a Jewish engraver, was born in Nizhny Novgorod in 1885.  When he was a student he became involved in radical politics and in 1902 joined the Social Democratic Party.  He quickly became a supporter of the Bolshevik faction led by Vladimir Lenin.  Sverdlov took part in the 1905 Revolution and developed a reputation as one of the party's leading orators.  Arrested in June, 1906, and was imprisoned for three years.  On his release in 1909 he moved to Moscow but he was now a well-known revolutionary and was soon arrested and deported to Siberia.  Sverdlov escaped in 1910 but was re-arrested and sentenced to four years in prison.  He made several unsuccessful attempts to escape and on one occasion nearly died after spending several hours in icy water.  In the autumn of 1912 Sverdlov managed to escape and reach St Petersburg.  He worked on Pravda until he was betrayed by the double agent Roman Malinovsky and was exiled to Turukhansk in Siberia.  Here he met Joseph Stalin, who was also in exile.  Sverdlov found him a difficult man to work with as he was \"too much of an egoist in everyday life. \" After the February Revolution and the abdication of Nicholas II, Sverdlov was released and he returned to Petrograd where he became a member of the Bolshevik Central Committee.  Together with Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky, Sverdlov was a strong advocate of an armed uprising and helped organize the October Revolution.  Yakov Sverdlov A close ally of Vladimir Lenin, Sverdlov played an important role in persuading leading Bolsheviks to accept the controversial decisions to close down the Constituent Assembly and the signing of the Brest-Litovsk Treaty.  It was claimed that Lenin provided the theories and Sverdlov made sure they worked.  Despite his young age, Sverdlov was expected to be Lenin's choice as the party's next leader.  In 1919 Sverdlov toured the country making speeches encouraging people to support the Bolsheviks in the struggle against the White Army.  While in Oryol he got he was a victim of the influenza epidemic that was spreading all of Europe. Yakov Sverdlov died, aged thirty-three, on 16th March, 1919. ", "article_5": "Yakov Mikhaylovich Sverdlov, (born May 22 [June 3, New Style], 1885, Nizhny Novgorod, Russia--died March 16, 1919, Moscow), Soviet Communist Party leader and government official.  His organizational skills and mastery of personnel made him a key figure in the Bolshevik Party in 1917-18.  The son of a Jewish engraver, Sverdlov became involved in politics while a teenager and joined the Russian Social-Democratic Workers Party in 1902.  When that party split in 1903, he joined the Bolshevik faction and remained thereafter a faithful adherent of the policies of Vladimir Lenin.  Sverdlov became a party organizer and agitator, working primarily in the Urals, where he headed the Bolshevik underground.  He was arrested a number of times and consequently served prison terms and periods of internal exile.  While in exile he was co-opted in 1912 into the Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party.  After the Russian monarchy was overthrown in early 1917, Sverdlov returned to Petrograd (St.  Petersburg) from internal exile.  He was soon reelected to the partys Central Committee and was appointed to head the party Secretariat.  The remarkable talents he displayed in the latter post made him in effect the partys chief organizer and its director of personnel.  Sverdlov figured importantly in the planning and execution of the Revolution of October 1917, which brought the Bolsheviks to power.  Sverdlov was subsequently elected chairman of the Central Executive Committee (CEC) of the All-Russian Congress of Soviets, thereby becoming titular head of the Bolshevik state (Nov.  8, 1917).  He used his power to bring the CEC and other organs of the new Soviet government firmly under Bolshevik Party control.  Like Lenin, Sverdlov believed in a highly centralized party hierarchy, and he worked to place all decision-making power in the partys Central Committee.  His working relations with Lenin were extremely close, with the two men dominating decision making in the Central Committee by late 1918.  It was Sverdlov who in July 1918 authorized the Urals Soviet to execute the Romanov imperial family in Yekaterinburg that month.  Sverdlov died of an infectious illness in 1919 and was buried on Moscows Red Square.  In 1924 the city of Yekaterinburg in the Urals, where he had performed much of his early party work, was renamed Sverdlovsk in his honour.  (The city reverted to its original name in 1991. ) Sverdlovs untimely death created a void in the Communist Partys organizational machinery that was never satisfactorily filled; Joseph Stalin took over the partys Secretariat in 1922.

In this Spanish name , the first or paternal surname isand the second or maternal family name is Leopoldo Antonio Lugones Arguello (13 June 1874 - 18 February 1938) was an Argentine poet, essayist, novelist, playwright, historian, professor, translator, biographer, philologist, theologian, diplomat, politician and journalist.  His poetic writings are often considered to be the founding works of Spanish-language modern poetry (not, however, modernismo).  His short stories made him a crucial precursor and also a pioneer of both the fantastic and science fiction literature in Argentina. Born in Villa de Maria del Rio Seco, a city in Cordoba Province, in Argentina's Catholic heartland, Lugones belonged to a family of landed gentry.  He was the firstborn son of Santiago M.  Lugones and Custodia Arguello.  His father, son of Pedro Nolasco Lugones, was returning from the city of Buenos Aires to Santiago del Estero when he met Custodia Arguello while stopping in Villa de Maria, a locality that was at that time disputed territory between the provinces of Santiago del Estero and Cordoba.  It was his mother who gave young Leopoldo his first lessons and was responsible for his strict Catholic upbringing.  When Lugones was six years old and following the birth of a second child, the family moved to the city of Santiago del Estero and later to Ojo de Agua, a small town situated in the south of the province of Santiago del Estero close to the border with Cordoba, where the poet's two younger brothers were born: Ramon Miguel Lugones (1880, Santiago del Estero), and the youngest of the four children, Carlos Florencio Lugones (1885, Ojo de Agua).  Later his parents sent him to study at the Colegio Nacional de Monserrat, in Cordoba, where his maternal grandmother lived.  In 1892 the family would move to that city, at the time when Lugones was beginning his forays into the fields of journalism and literature.  He first worked for La Montana, a newspaper, and was in favour with the aristocratic Manuel Quintana, a candidate to become a president of Argentina.  This brought him first to Buenos Aires in 1896, where his literary talent developed quickly.  That year, he married Juana Agudelo, from whom he had a son, Leopoldo Polo Lugones, who would become the notorious chief of the Federal Police during the dictatorship of Jose Felix Uriburu.  In 1899, he became an active Freemason. Lugones was the leading Argentine exponent of the Latin American literary current known as Modernismo.  This was a form of Parnassianism influenced by Symbolism.  He was also the author of the incredibly dense and rich historical novel La Guerra Gaucha (1905).  He was an impassioned journalist, polemicist and public speaker who at first was a Socialist, later a conservative/traditionalist and finally a supporter of Fascism and as such an inspiration for a group of rightist intellectuals such as Juan Carulla and Rodolfo Irazusta.  Leopoldo Lugones went to Europe in 1906, 1911, 1913 and in 1930, in which latter year he supported the coup d'etat against the aging Radical party president, Hipolito Yrigoyen.  Between 1924 and 1931, Lugones took part in the works of the International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation of the League of Nations. On February 18, 1938, the despairing and disillusioned Lugones committed suicide by taking a mixture of whisky and cyanide while staying at the river resort of El Tigre in Buenos Aires.  Political frustration has been the most widely cited cause of his suicide.  Nevertheless, recent publications in Argentina have shed light on another possible motivation: Lugones was very enamored of a girl he met at one of his lectures in the university.  He maintained a passionate and emotional relationship with her until, discovered and pressured by his son, he was forced to leave her, causing in him a depressive decline that would end his life. His descendants have had similarly tragic fates.  It is believed that his son Polo, the chief of police during Uriburu's dictatorship, was the creator of the picana and the one who introduced it as a method of torture.  Polo Lugones committed suicide in 1971.  Polo's younger daughter, Susana \"Piri\" Lugones, was detained and disappeared in December 1977 as a victim of the Dirty War. His older daughter, Carmen, whom he called Babu, is still alive.  One of Piri's sons, Alejandro, committed suicide, like his great-grandfather, in Tigre.  This comprises Lugones' tragic familial fate, curiously similar to that of Horacio Quiroga's, himself a friend and admirer of Leopoldo Lugones.

Hombre de vasta cultura, fue el maximo exponente del modernismo argentino y una de las figuras mas influyentes de la literatura hispanoamericana.  Paso la ninez y la adolescencia en su tierra natal, y tras breve temporada en Santiago del Estero, se establecio en Buenos Aires en 1895.  Trabajo en el diario El Tiempo y en 1897 fundo, con Jose Ingenieros, La Montana, periodico socialista revolucionario.  Leopoldo Lugones Tras algunos empleos menores, llego a la direccion de la Biblioteca Nacional de Maestros.  Hizo varios viajes a Europa y residio en Paris de 1911 a 1914.  Colaboro en La Nacion y obtuvo el Premio Nacional de Literatura en 1926.  En 1928 fundo la Sociedad Argentina de Escritores.  Su apoyo al golpe de Estado de 1930, la posterior desilusion que este le produjo y quizas una profunda crisis sentimental lo llevaron a una depresion que culmino en su suicidio.  Es de destacar su particular evolucion politica.  Leopoldo Lugones se inicio como un firme partidario de la ideologia socialista, cuya introduccion en Argentina se debe, en parte, a sus primeras soflamas politicas.  Sin embargo, poco a poco fue retrocediendo hacia posturas mas conservadoras: tras un breve periodo de adscripcion al pensamiento liberal, se inclino decididamente hacia la derecha y acabo convertido en uno de los principales valedores del fascismo argentino, sobre todo a partir de 1924, fecha en la que proclamo que habia llegado \"la hora de la espada\".  Seis anos despues, ya consagrado como una de las cabezas pensantes del movimiento reaccionario austral, colaboro activamente con el golpe de estado militar del general Jose Felix Uriburu (6 de septiembre de 1930).  La obra de Leopoldo Lugones Como poeta, Leopoldo Lugones irrumpio en el panorama literario argentino con el poemario Los mundos (1893), que paso practicamente inadvertido.  Su encuentro con Ruben Dario, en Buenos Aires, en 1896, fue decisivo para reorientar la poesia de Lugones.  El retoricismo de Las montanas de oro (1897) no tardo en ser sustituido por el tono ironico, extravagante e imaginativo de Los crepusculos del jardin (1905) y Lunario sentimental (1909).  En ambos libros se respira una atmosfera refinada y decadente, plena de languidez y elegancia modernistas, dentro de una corriente estetica claramente influida por la creacion de Ruben Dario.  Su estilo se distingue por su originalidad creadora, y la precision y la belleza lirica de sus versos.  A partir de 1910 Leopoldo Lugones cambio de registro poetico para centrarse en una exaltacion de su tierra y sus gentes (Odas seculares, 1910).  Posteriormente los asuntos cotidianos, vistos al trasluz de una rutina intima, se convirtieron en el objeto de su siguiente entrega poetica, titulada El libro fiel (1912), obra a la que siguieron otros poemarios como El libro de los paisajes (1917), Las horas doradas (1922) y Romancero (1924).  Al final de su trayectoria poetica, Lugones se decanto por el cultivo de una poesia narrativa: Poemas solariegos (1927) y Romances del Rio Seco (que vio la luz, postumamente, en 1938).  En su faceta de narrador, Lugones sobresalio principalmente por sus relatos, recogidos en Las fuerzas extranas (1906), La torre de Casandra (1919), Cuentos fatales (1924) y La patria fuerte (1933).  En muchas de estas narraciones breves, Lugones ensayo diferentes acercamientos fantasticos que pueden considerarse precursores de los mejores relatos de algunos de los mas grandes cultivadores de este dificil genero, como Horacio Quiroga, Jorge Luis Borges (uno de los mayores admiradores de Lugones) y Julio Cortazar.  Publico ademas dos novelas esplendidas: un relato historico sobre la guerra de la independencia, titulado La guerra gaucha (1905), y unas meditaciones esotericas que, en forma de novela teosofica, aparecieron bajo el titulo de El angel de la sombra (1926).  En la decada de los anos cuarenta, La guerra gaucha fue objeto de una version cinematografica que se convirtio en uno de los principales referentes del cine argentino de su tiempo.  Tambien brillo Leopoldo Lugones en su condicion de ensayista, faceta en la que dejo algunos titulos tan relevantes como El imperio jesuitico (1904), Las limaduras de Hephaestos (1910) e Historia de Sarmiento (1911).  Las conferencias sobre el Martin Fierro de Jose Hernandez, obra que leyo como poema epico, reunidas en El payador (1916), constituyen sin duda un hito en la interpretacion de la literatura gauchesca.  Ademas, dejo testimonio impreso de las constantes mutaciones de su pensamiento politico, plasmadas en Mi beligerancia y La grande Argentina.

", "article_2": "Jorge Francisco Isidoro Luis Borges Acevedo, usually referred to as Jorge Luis Borges (Spanish pronunciation: [xorxe lwis borxes]), was an Argentine writer and poet born in Buenos Aires.  In 1914, his family moved to Switzerland where he attended school and traveled to Spain.  On his return to Argentina in 1921, Borges began publishing his poems and essays in Surrealist literary journals.  He also worked as a librarian and public lecturer.  Borges was fluent in several languages.  He was a target of political persecution during the Peron regime, and supported the military juntas that overthrew it.  Due to a hereditary condition, Borges became blind in his late fifties.  In 1955, he was appointed director of the National Public Library (Biblioteca Nacional) and professor of Literature at the University of Buenos Aires.  In 1961, he came to international attention when he received the first International Publishers' Prize Prix Formentor.  His work was translated and published widely in the United States and in Europe.  He died in Geneva, Switzerland, in 1986.  J.  M.  Coetzee said of Borges: \"He, more than anyone, renovated the language of fiction and thus opened the way to a remarkable generation of Spanish American novelists. \"", "article_3": "Leopoldo Lugones (1874-1938) While some view Leopoldo Lugones as the foremost promoter of Argentine nationalism, others just as vehemently oppose this designation due to his controversial and ever-changing political beliefs.  Regardless of personal opinion, his wide literary corpus provides an interesting insight into Argentine life at the beginning of the twentieth century.  The Department of Special Collections currently holds two manuscript poems as well as a letter written by the author to socialist reformer Alfredo J.  Torcelli through a gift of Robert O'Grady.  Lugones began his literary career in Buenos Aires with the publication of Montanas de oro in 1897, a collection of poetry that revealed his skill with the aesthetic of modernismo.  His work quickly attracted the attention of other writers, including the father of the movement, Ruben Dario, who praised the work of the much younger Lugones.  His popularity only increased with the publication of Lunario sentimental, the collection of poems that would prove to be most influential on the younger generation of writers.  Another literary highlight came in 1916, when a series of lectures on the classic text Martin Fierro was compiled and published as El payador.  Lugones enjoyed success among his peers until the 1920s, when his political views shifted from fervent socialist to outspoken fascist, a change reflected in his work.  Typical titles from the end of his life include La patria fuerte, and La grande Argentina.  Biographical Information Lugones was born in 1874 to financially comfortable family, a setting very typical for other young Argentine writers.  Unlike his contemporaries, as a young man Lugones did not attend law school and instead joined the National Guard, eventually pursuing a governmental career with the Post Office.  By 1896 he had moved to Buenos Aires from the family home in the province of Cordoba, and had married Juana Gonzalez.  He was also on the verge of publishing his first important collection of poetry, an achievement that would bring him national fame.  At the beginning of the twentieth century Lugones was sufficiently important to be appointed by the government as the new Inspector General of Education and was sent to Paris to conduct research.  While there, he was able to meet European writers and stay in contact with South American authors living abroad, such as Ruben Dario.  Lugones continued his travels between Argentina and Europe until the end of World War One, seeing firsthand the often difficult process of postwar reconstruction.  He became disillusioned with democratic forms of government, and consequently embraced fascism in the 1920s.  In addition to expressing his extreme patriotism in his literary endeavors, Lugones went so far as to be an active participant in the 1930 coup d'etat that brought General Jose Uriburu to power.  Little personal information is known about his last years; he committed suicide in 1938.  Return to top of page Description of Archival Collection (MSH/SCL 1174-1 to 1174-2 and 1176-1) The Department of Special Collections holds four Lugones manuscripts.  One manuscript is widely known as the final work of Lugones, his prose article \"Arte y cultura. \" The manuscript shows editorial corrections made by the author, and is dated February 18, 1930, indicating that it was written shortly before his suicide.  It is accompanied by a copy of La nacion from March 20, 1938, in which the work is reprinted in memorial.  Of equal interest in the Lugones materials is the poem, \"A America,\" written when the author was only 15 years old.  This work is not found in the Obras completas, although it shares similarities in theme and tone with his Odas seculares.  La estetica liberal, 7 manuscript leaves with handwritten corrections (1933), is a critique of the 1933 work Trilogia de la trata de blancas by the Buenos Aires chief of police, Julio Alsogaray.  Lugones' dislike for liberal policies is stated in no uncertain terms and he even lashes out at the Soviet Union.  The fourth manuscript is Etica y estetica, 17 leaves with handwritten corrections (1937).  The work was sent to Eduardo Mallea, the director of the literary supplement of Argentinas major newspaper La Nacion.  In this essay Lugones carefully presents his philosophical views on esthetics.

Though nothing very profound at its origin, this concept preoccupied me until I enounced the following anthropological postulate: monkeys were men who for some reason or other stopped speaking.  This resulted in the atrophy of their organs of phonation and the brain's language centers, virtually suppressing the link between the latter and the former, fixing the species' language to an inarticulate cry, and resulting in the descent of the primitive human into animality.  Of course if one went and demonstrated this, one would have explained all the quirks that make monkeys such singular creatures.  There could be only one possible demonstration: to restore monkeys' capacity for speech.  In the meantime I had gone 'round the world with mine, drawing close to him through our shared travels and adventures.  In Europe he drew attention, and had I wished to I could have provided him the social exposure of a Consul; but such a burlesque scene would have ill-suited my businessman's sense of etiquette.  Working on the basis of my fixation regarding monkey language, I exhausted all the bibliographical sources concerning the question, with no appreciable results.  All I knew --- and that with great certainty --- was that there was no scientific reason why monkeys do not speak.  It took five years of ruminations to convince myself of this.  Yzur (a name whose origin I never could discover, as his previous owner had not known it either), Yzur was certainly a remarkable animal.  His training by the circus, while reduced almost entirely to mimicry, had significantly developed his faculties; and this was what most strongly incited me to use him as a testing ground for my --- in all appearances --- crazy theory.  On the other hand, it is well known that among the monkeys the chimpanzee (which Yzur was) carries the best brain and is one of the most docile, which increased my chances.  Whenever I saw him walking on two feet, with his hands to his shoulders to keep his balance, with the look of a drunken sailor, the conviction of his lengthy humanity invigorated in me.  Truly there is no reason why the monkey cannot have fully articulate speech.  Their natural language, that is to say, the set of shouts through which they communicate to their fellows, is sufficiently diverse.  The monkey's larynx, while quite distinct from that of the human being, is not as much so as that of parrots, which clearly can speak.  As to their brains, the comparison with that of the latter banishes all doubts.  It is important to remember that while the brain of the mentally challenged is also rudimentary, some cretins can pronounce some words.  Regarding Broca's convolution, it clearly depends of the total development of the brain; besides which it has not been absolutely proven that it houses the centres of language.  While it is the location established as likeliest through anatomical studies, the contradictory facts are of course incontestable.  Fortunately, monkeys have, along their numerous bad habits, a taste for learning, as their imitative tendency illustrates; a good memory, a capacity for reflection resulting in a strong ability for dissimulation, and an attention span comparatively more developed than that of a child.  They are, then, pedagogically-speaking, most favourable subjects.  In addition, mine was young, and it is known that youth constitutes the most intellectual time for monkeys, similar in this to the negro.  The difficulty resided only in what method to use in getting words across to him.  Knowing of all the fruitless attempts of my predecessors; it would be fruitless to add, that despite the competence of some of them yet the fruitlessness of all their efforts, my designs were doomed to failure.  Much thought on the subject led me to the conclusion that: The first goal consists of developing the monkey's phonic apparatus.  Thus is it, in effect, how one proceeds with deaf people before teaching them to articulate.  I had not long considered this question, when the analogies between the deaf-mute and the monkey overwhelmed my thoughts.  First of all, their extraordinary range of mimicry, compensating for their lack of an articulated language, demonstrates that not having the ability to speak does not mean one stops thinking, i. e. , that the waning of one faculty results from by the loss of another.  Other more specific characteristics must then be taken into account: work ethic, loyalty, courage, clearly bolstered by two further characteristics whose synergism is truly revealing; the facility for feats of balance and the resistance to dizziness and nausea.  I then decided to begin my work with a genuine exercise of the lips and tongue of my monkey, treating him in this manner as a mute-deaf.  Furthermore, I emphasized his use of hearing, so as to establish direct communication through the use of words, alleviating the need for a tactile approach.  The reader will see that in this case my expectations were overly optimistic.  Fortunately, of all of the great monkeys, the chimpanzees are those with the most adaptable lips; and in this particular case, Yzur, having suffered throat infections, knew how to open his mouth so that it could be examined.  A first assessment partly confirmed my suspicions.  The tongue remained at the back of his mouth, like an inert mass, without movements other than in swallowing.  The exercise has produced its effect rapidly, because in two months he already knew how to stick out his tongue in jest.  This was the first occasion that I know of when I was able to link the movement of his tongue to a concept; a relationship, on the other hand, perfectly in keeping with his nature.  It was harder to work with lips because I had to stretch them apart with clamps; but he understood --- perhaps by my expression --- the importance of that anomalous task and undertook it with gusto.  While I was demonstrating the labials movements he had yet to practice, he remained seated, with his arm twisted backwards scratching his rump and yawing in doubtful concentration, or smoothing his sideburns with the air of a man who is working out something in his head by means of rythmical gestures.  In the end he learned to move his lips.  But the exercise of speech is a difficult art, as it is proven by the long stammering of babies, which occurs in parallel with their intellectual development and acquisition of learned behaviours.  It was demonstrated, in effect, that the center of the vocal nerves is associated with that of speech in such a way that the normal development of both depends on their harmonious exercise.  This had already been pointed out by Heinicke in 1785, the creator of the oral method of education of the deaf-mute, along with its philosophical consequence.  He speaks of \"a dynamic concatenation of ideas\", a phrase whose great clarity would do honour to more than one contemporary psychologist.  Yzur was, with respect to speech, in the same situation as that of babies who before speaking already understands a number of words; but given his greater life experience, he was much more apt to make judgements regarding certain things.  These judgments, that, judging by the different forms they took, not only represented a gathering of impressions, but a sign of inquisitiveness and of reasoned analysis, suppose a capacity for abstract thinking.  This indicated his superior degree of intelligence, which was most favourable to my purposes.  If my theories appear overly audacious, it should be sufficient to reflect that the syllogism, that is the fundamental basis of logical argument, is not alien to the mind of a number of animals.  For originally, the syllogism was a comparison between two sensations.  If not, then why do animals that know of men flee from them, and not from those that they have never met? I began, then, the phonetic education of Yzur.  It involved with first teaching him words mechanically, then progressively moving onto meaningful words.  Monkeys having a voice and thus a great capacity for rudimentary articulations, have, so to speak, an advantage over the deaf-mute.  It was only a matter of teaching him the differences that constitute the phonemes and their articulations, termed static or dynamic by teachers, according to whether they refer to vowels or consonants.  Given the gluttony of monkeys, and following in this a method used by Heinicke with the deaf-mute, I decided to associate each vowel with a treat: a with papa (potato); e with leche (milk); i with vino (wine); o with coco (coconut); u with azucar (sugar), so that the vowels were either individually dominant or repeated in the name of the treat, as in papa, coco, leche, or presented in combination, with tonic and prosodic accentuation, as in vino, azucar.  In terms of the vowels, everything turned out well, as these sounds are formed with the open mouth.  Yzur learned them in a fortnight.  However, sometimes, the air in his cheeks imparted a thundering roar to them.  He had the most difficulty in pronouncing the letter u.  The consonants gave me a lot of trouble.  I also learned that he would never be able to pronounce those consonants whose formation involves the teeth and gums.  His long eyeteeth and his cheeks entirely hindered him from doing so.  The vocabulary was reduced, then to the five vowels and the consonants b, k, m, g, f and c.  This is to say all those consonants whose formation requires nothing but palate and the tongue.  For this the ear was not sufficient, even for me.  I had to appeal to the sense of touch like a deaf-mute, placing his hands on my chest and soon after on his chest so that he could feel the vibration of the sound.  And three years passed, without him being able to achieve the pronounciation of any words.  He tended to associate things with the letters whose sound predominated in the associated noun.  This was all.  In the circus he had learned to bark like his task-mates the dogs; and when he saw me giving up hope in trying to make him speak, he barked strongly, as though to show me everything he knew.  He pronounced the vowels and consonants separately, but he could not string them together.  Beyond that, we would string together a sequence of p's and m's.  As slow as it was, there has been a great change in his character.  His facial features had lost their mobility, his gaze arose from great depths and he adopted meditative poses.  He had acquired, for example, the custom of contemplating the stars.  His sensitivity had also grown; he could easily be brought to tears.  The lessons continued with unwavering determination, although with no greater success.  It had become a painful obsession, and little by little I became inclined to use force.  My character had been soured by failure, until it had assume a heedless animosity towards Yzur.  He was becoming more and more of an introvert; in his stubborn silence, he began to convince me that I would never remove budge him from his stance, when it suddenly dawned on me that he did not to speak because he did not want to.  One night the cook, horrified, came to tell me that he had surprised the monkey \"speaking genuine words\".  Yzur was, according to the cook's story, curled up next to a fig tree in the orchard; but the cook's fright was so great that he could not recall the most essential element, namely, the words.  He seems to remember only two: cama (bed) and pipa (pipe).  His stupidity almost led me to kicked him.  Needless to say, I spent the night in a highly excited state; and undertook that which I had not done in three years --- a mistake that brought all to nought --- out of nervous tension arising from a lack of sleep, as much as from an excessive curiosity.  Instead of allowing the monkey to manifest his capacity for language on his own terms, the next day I called him to bear and tried to force him and draw obedience from him under threat of punishment.  I got nothing but p's and m's out of him, the which I was already fed up of.  Then there was his hypocritical expression and --- God forgive me --- a certain hint of irony in the faces he was pulling.  This angered me, and thoughtlessly I struck him with a whip.  The only thing I could get out of him was tears and an even more absolute silence, unbroken even by moans.  On the third day he fell into a kind of dark dementia complicated by meningitis-like symptoms.  Leeches, cold infusions, purgatives, cutaneous counterirritants, alcohol rubs, bromide --- all the therapeutic tools at my disposal were applied to him.  I fought with desperate determination, stimulated by remorse and fear.  This was because I believed the beast to be a victim of my cruelty; and because he might take his secret to the grave.  After long time he improved, however, he remained so weak that he could not move himself in the bed.  His brush with death had ennobled and humanized him.  His eyes full of gratitude, were always fixed on me and followed me around the room like two revolving balls, even if I was behind him.  His hand searched for mine in the intimacy of his convalescence.  In my own great solitude, he was quickly acquiring the importance of a person.  The demon of experimentation, which is naught else but a form of the spirit of perversity, drove me to renew, nevertheless, my experiments.  In fact the monkey had spoken.  That could not go unnoticed.  I began very slowly, asking him to pronounce the letters he could pronounce.  Nothing! I left him alone for some hours, spying on him through a peep-hole in the partition.  Nothing! I spoke to him with brief sentences, trying to reach his loyalty or his gluttony.  Nothing! When those words were sad, his eyes would well up with tears.  When I spoke to him a phrase that he already knew, such as \"I am your Master,\" with which I usually began all my lessons, or \"You are my monkey\" to complete my previous statement, to inspire a confidence in the complete truth of my statements, he acknowledged by closing his eyelids, but he neither gave out a sound, nor even moved his lips.  He had resume making gestures as the sole means of communicating with me; and this adding to his analogy to the deaf-mute, redouble my preoccupations, because nobody can ignore the great predisposition of the latter to mental diseases.  At times I wished that he might go crazy, to see if the associated nervous excitement would break his silence.  His convalescence remained unchanged, he showed the same sadness.  It was evident that this was a sickness of the mind and spirit.  The organism had collapsed under the impulse of an abnormal use of the brain, and in a few days more or less, he would become a lost cause.  Furthermore, in spite of the meekness that the progression of his convalescence brought on, his silence, that exasperating silence, cause of my desperation, did not yield.  From some obscure font of habits petrified into instinct, his race had imposed its millenarian silence upon animals, fortifying an atavistic will at the very roots of its being.  The ancient men of the forest, who were forced into silence and submission, that is to say, to intellectual suicide, by who knows what barbarian injustice, kept their secret: forest taboos developed in prehistoric abysses, but grown formidable through the immensity of time into in the monkey's unconscious decision.  It was the misfortune of the anthropoids to have lagged behind in the evolution whose lead had been taken by humans, and who had in a dark, barbaric despotism doubtlessly overthrown the great families of quadrupeds from their arboreal dominion over their primitive Eden, winnowing their numbers, capturing their females to enslave their broods fresh from the maternal belly, instilling in the defeated anthropoid their impotence.  These, in order to protect their mortal dignity, broke their one unfortunate bond with the enemy, that of the word, seeking salvation in the ultimate night of lower animality.  And what horrors, what horrible atrocities would the winners not have committed upon these half- beasts at a critical moment in evolution, so that this these, rather than being content with intellectual gift that was the paradisiacal fruit of the Bible, were resigned to giving up the claudication of their race, and the degradation of their breed to an equality with of the inferior creatures; to that retrogression which forever crystallized their intelligence in the gestures of an acrobatic automat; to that great cowardice of life that would eternally bend, as a symbol of their beastiality, the backs of the dominated, and reinforce those melancholic features that remains at heart of their nature.  Here I was, on the brink of success, when my bad humour had arisen from some great atavistic limbo.  Across millions of years, the word, with its spell, had remained dormant in the ancient simian soul; but set against that temptation to violate the darkness of protective animality, were ancestral memory, which instilled an instinctive horror in the lower species, forming across eons and eons a powerful barrier.  Yzur began his death agony without losing consciousness.  A sweet agony closed his eyes, his breathing weak, his weak pulse, a complete calm broken when, on occasion, he turned to me with a heartbreaking expression of eternity, with the expression of an old mulatto.  And the last night, the night of his death, was when it happened, that extraordinary thing which led me to undertake this narrative.  I had slept by his side, overcome by the heat and the calm of the growing twilight, when I felt something suddenly grasp my wrist.  I woke up frightened.  The monkey, with his eyes wide open, was definitively dying now, and his expression was so human, that it horrified me; but his hand, his eyes, drew me strongly towards him, such that I had to bend immediately to his face; and then, with his last sigh, the last sigh that crowned and simultaneously dashed my hopes, he spoke up --- I am certain --- and spoke in a murmur (how can one explain the tone of a voice that has remained speechless for ten thousand centuries) these words whose humanity reconciled our species: -- FRIEND, WATER, FRIEND, MY FRIEND .  .  .

He was a strong influence on the younger generation of writers that included the prominent short-story writer and novelist Jorge Luis Borges.  His influence in public life set the pace for national development in the arts and education.  Lugones began as a socialist journalist, settling in Buenos Aires, where in 1897 he helped found La montana (\"The Mountain\"), a socialist journal, and became an active member of the group of Modernist experimental poets led by the Nicaraguan Ruben Dario.  Lugones first important collection of poems, Las montanas del oro (1897; \"Mountains of Gold\"), reveals his affinity with the goals of Modernism in its use of free verse and exotic imagery, devices that he continued in Los crepusculos del jardin (1905; \"Twilights in the Garden\") and Lunario sentimental (1909; \"Sentimental Lunar Almanac\").

Between 1911 and 1914 Lugones lived in Paris, editing the Revue Sudamericaine (\"South American Review\"), but he returned to Argentina at the outbreak of World War I.  A change in his political outlook from the radical socialism of his youth to an intense conservative nationalism was paralleled in his art by a rejection of Modernism in favour of a treatment of national themes in a realistic style.  This change, already foreshadowed in the prose sketches of La guerra gaucha (1905; \"The Gaucho War\"), was fully revealed in the poems of El libro de los paisajes (1917; \"The Book of Landscapes\"), which extolled the beauty of the Argentine countryside.  Lugones continued to develop native themes in such prose works as Cuentos fatales (1924; \"Tales of Fate\"), a collection of short stories, and the novel El angel de la sombra (1926; \"The Angel of the Shadow\").  Lugones was director of the National Council of Education (1914-38), and he represented Argentina in the Committee on Intellectual Cooperation of the League of Nations (1924).  He was also noted for several volumes of Argentine history, for studies of Classical Greek literature and culture, and for his Spanish translations of the Iliad and the Odyssey.  An introverted man who thought of himself primarily as a poet, Lugones was genuinely uneasy about the prominence that he had achieved and the public responsibilities that it entailed.  He became a fascist in 1929.  Under great emotional strain in later years, he committed suicide. "}}

Surprise of Satalieh 298 Appendix 308 p.  vii INTRODUCTION I Eothen is the earliest work of Alexander William Kinglake, best known as the historian of the Crimean War.  It is an account of a tour--or rather of selected adventures which occurred during a tour--undertaken in the Levant in 1834, but was not published until ten years later.  The biographical notices of the Author are somewhat meagre, as by his dying directions all his papers were destroyed.  He was born near Taunton in 1809, and educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge, at which latter he is said to have been the friend of Thackeray and Tennyson.  On leaving college he started on his Oriental tour with Lord Pollington (the Methley of Eothen), and on returning to England was called to the Bar at Lincolns Inn, and obtained a lucrative practice.  But the life was too tame to suit his taste.  In 1845 he visited Algeria, and went through a campaign with the flying column of St.  Arnaud; and in 1854 went to the Crimea with Lord Raglan, and was present at the p.  viiibattle of Alma.  On returning to England he decided to go into politics, and was elected for Bridgewater in 1857 in the Liberal interest.  He seems to have been a poor speaker, and to have exercised little parliamentary influence; but we are told that in 1859 he was strongly opposed to the Conspiracy Bill, which was introduced after Orsinis attempt to murder Napoleon III. , and that in 1860 he denounced the cession of Nice and Savoy to France.  In both cases he was apparently actuated by his personal dislike of Napoleon, which is evident in his historical works.  In 1868 he was again returned for Bridgewater, but unseated on petition, for bribery.  One might have supposed that he had acquired this habit in the East, but his biographers assert that he knew nothing of the irregularities which were committed by his agents.  But the chief business of his later life was the composition of the History of the War in the Crimea, of which the first two volumes appeared in 1863, and the seventh and eighth (completing the work) in 1887.  He died in 1891.  II His earlier and less ambitious, though perhaps more charming, book was rejected by several publishers, but proved an immense success.  It caught the popular fancy at once, and after the lapse of more than fifty years still maintains an honourable p.  ixposition.  In the year after its first appearance it passed through three editions, containing several variations from the editio princeps which have attracted the attention of those who are interested in bibliography.  It is only fair to reprint the book with these corrections, which seem mostly due to the authors laudable desire for greater accuracy.  For instance, he was apparently seized with qualms as to his assertion (end of chap.  xiii. ) that when he emerged from the Dead Sea after bathing therein his \"skin was thickly encrusted with sulphate of magnesia,\" and cautiously substituted \"salts\" for the more chemical expression.  Yet I observe that the most recent Encyclopaedia states that \"the water of the Dead Sea is characterised by the presence of a large quantity of magnesian salts,\" so perhaps his first statement was not so wrong after all.  He also found that he had talked of Jove when he should have said Neptune in his account of the Troad, and, conceiving a mistrust of the former deity, removed his name not only from this passage but also from chap.  xviii. , in which he altered \"That touch was worthy of Jove\" into \"In that touch was true hospitality. \" I confess that I think this regard for truth might have moved him to expunge his account of the advances made to him by the young ladies of Bethlehem (end of chap.  xvi. ); I cannot believe that narrative to be even probable, but anyone may retort that my scepticism is due to the absence of those attractive qualities which Kinglake possessed.  p.  xIn chap.  xvi.  he says that shrouds are dipped in the holy water of the Jordan and \"preserved as a burial dress which shall inure\" (later editions \"enure\") \"for salvation in the realms of death. \" Some critical scholar of eminence should be called upon to emend or explain this mysterious passage.  At least, if people are allowed to print such things in the nineteenth century what right have we to emend the classical authors when they choose to be unintelligible? The truth is that Eothen, despite its great literary merits, is often comfortably slipshod.  And very properly so, for if there is to be any correspondence between subject and style, it must be inappropriate for a traveller recounting confidentially his diversions and mishaps to adopt the phraseology of Gibbon.  Matthew Arnold, in his \"Essay on the Literary Influence of Academies,\" selected the History of the Crimean War as an example of what he called the Corinthian style.  Eothen certainly presents specimens of this manner, but they are hardly characteristic; it is often \"urbane,\" and has \"the warm glow, blithe movement, and pliancy of life,\" which, according to the critics definition, Corinthians lack.  It is not devoid of unity, but it is many sided and kaleidoscopic.  The author varies from the trivial to the solemn, from boisterous exuberance to careful austerity, from flippancy to rhapsody, and is perhaps never quite serious.  One wonders whether one is reading a clever but somewhat slangy letter, or a long-meditated p.  xiessay polished and repolished by incessant labor limae.  Perhaps between 1834 and 1844 he worked up and rearranged old spontaneous effusions, as indeed his preface suggests.  He often writes like a schoolboy, and sometimes like a philosopher; he is at his best when he records what he has seen in phrases not without rhetoric and not without humour, but distinct and clear as his own impressions.  \"The foot falls noiseless in the crumbling soil of an Eastern city, and silence follows you still.  Again and again you meet turbans, and faces of men, but they have nothing for you--no welcome--no wonder--no wrath--no scorn--they look upon you as we do upon a Decembers fall of snow--as a 'seasonable, unaccountable, uncomfortable work of God, that may have been sent for some good purpose to be revealed hereafter. \" How vivid and how true! But perhaps the reader may ask, as I ask myself, whether an introduction to Eothen is really necessary.  The book is so simple and complete in itself that it seems to require no explanation or commentary.  But for the benefit of those who are not acquainted with the Levant of to-day, it is well to explain that the sixty-four years which have elapsed since Kinglake made his Eastern tour have brought about important changes in the extent, and some few in the condition, of the Turkish Empire.  The \"unchanging East\" is a popular phrase which is only true in a very limited sense.  It has arisen chiefly from the habit of pious publishers of representing Abraham in the p.  xiicostume of a modern Bedouin Sheikh, and it is peculiarly audacious to apply it to regions like Constantinople and Egypt, which have witnessed exceptional vicissitudes and undergone remarkable changes,--political, religious, and linguistic.  It is however just to say that the Turk is unchanging,--and it is to the presence of the Turk that are due the peculiar characteristics of the Levant, as the region visited by Kinglake may conveniently be termed; like the Bourbons, he forgets nothing and learns nothing; as he was on the day when he entered Europe, so he was in 1834 and so he is now.  The boundaries of Turkey have changed; there are now no Pashas at Belgrade, or even at Sofia; and Ottoman territory is no longer plague-stricken.  But whenever one crosses the Turkish frontier, one may find functionaries like the delightful potentate of Karagholookoldour, and be conscious of effecting within the space of a few hundred yards a change greater than can be experienced in any amount of travel in other European countries, including Russia.  One passes from regions where people have roughly the same habits and ideas as ourselves--where they believe in political economy, get drunk in public, sit upon chairs, and do not feel there is anything indelicate in mentioning their wives--to a land where people do none of these things, where the naked desolation of the country at the side of the railway offers a startling contrast to the smug prosperity of the Balkan States, where people prefer to sit curled up on hard sofas, and where it p.  xiiiis bad taste to condole with a man on his wifes death.  In 1834, the year of Kinglakes journey, Turkey in Europe was considerably more extensive than at the present day.  Greece had already revolted and been recognised as an independent state.  Wallachia and Moldavia were in process of securing their freedom.  But the territories now known as Bulgaria, Bosnia, and Herzegovina were still integral portions of the Ottoman Empire; and though Servia (in which the scene of the opening chapters of Eothen is laid) had been constituted a principality under Milosh Obrenovich as prince, in 1830, several of the fortresses were still garrisoned by Ottoman troops, which accounts for the presence of the Pasha at Belgrade.  It is interesting to observe that though our Author must have proceeded to Adrianople straight across Bulgaria, he never mentions the name of that country.  This apparently strange omission is really quite natural.  The Bulgarians, though in some ways the most vigorous element among the Balkan races, passed through greater trials than the Servians or Roumanians, and for a time lost their national consciousness more completely.  They were nearer Constantinople, and therefore any political movement was more easily kept in check; while all the religious and educational establishments of the country were in the hands of Greek priests who practically proscribed the Bulgarian language.  I have been informed by a gentleman who has resided p.  xivforty years in Turkey, that when he first entered the Ottoman dominions every educated Bulgarian called himself a Greek, and would have been ashamed to employ his national designation, which was hardly in general use before the movement of 1860.  Another striking omission of Eothen is that it contains hardly any allusion to the Sultan.  At the present day the descendant of Osman, who claims to be also the successor of the Prophet, is a well-known figure to the British public.  The Pall Mall Gazette familiarly calls him \"The Shadow. \" [xiv] The friends of the Armenians hold him personally responsible for the massacres; and a modern Kinglake, even if bent on avoiding \"political disquisitions,\" would certainly describe the Selamlik or weekly visit of the Sovereign to the mosque.  You cannot travel in Turkey without hearing the name of \"Our Master\" (Effendimiz) or \"the Imperial Person\" (Zat-i-Shahane) daily mentioned, and feeling that his wishes (which usually do not coincide with those of European travellers, and affect the minutest details) are the only real power in the country.  This state of things is due almost entirely to the personal energy of the present occupant of the Ottoman throne, who for good or evil has succeeded in concentrating all power into his hands, and in displaying the greatest p.  xvexample of practical autocracy ever seen.  In 1834 Mahmoud was Sultan, one of the most vigorous of Ottoman princes, but then near his end, and doubtless wearied out by a reign of constant reverse and ineffectual efforts at reform.  The Armenian question, like the Bulgarian, is of recent date, and we consequently find that Kinglake says as little of the one as of the other; but he often speaks of the doings of Mehemet Ali and his son Ibrahim Pasha, which at this period formed one of the chief preoccupations of the Porte.  Mehemet Ali was a native of Cavalla who held a military command in Egypt.  In the troubles which succeeded the French occupation of that country, at the beginning of the century, he succeeded in making himself head of the popular party in Cairo, ousted the Turkish Governor, and established himself in his place.  He was recognised by the Porte in 1805, and the Khediviate was subsequently made hereditary in his family.  At this time the Mamluks (or descendants of the Turkish Guard instituted by the Sultans of Egypt in the thirteenth century) occupied a position somewhat similar to that of the Janissaries at Constantinople.  Mehemet Ali, like Sultan Mahmoud, felt that this military imperium in imperio rendered fixed Government impossible, and determined to consolidate his own rule by breaking the power of the Mamluks.  He did so by inviting their leaders to a banquet, at which they were surprised and massacred.  The Sultan, in return for his recognition p.  xviof Mehemet Ali as ruler of Egypt, made use of him during some years to keep in order various rebellious provinces of the Empire.  He was first ordered to quell the Wahabi insurrection in Arabia, and his campaign there is alluded to in chap.  xviii.  These people were a sort of Mohammedan Puritans [xvi] who had made themselves masters of the Holy Cities of Mecca and Medina.  Mehemet Ali sent against them his son Tosun, who captured Mecca in 1813, but died, and was replaced by his younger brother Ibrahim Pasha, who is often mentioned in Eothen.  He finally concluded the Wahabi war in 1818, and is next heard of fighting against Greece, which was beginning the struggle for independence.  Mehemet Ali was again called upon to assist the Sultan in suppressing rebellion, and again sent his son to represent him.  Ibrahim captured Missolonghi in 1825, but was defeated in 1827 by the united fleets at Navarino, under Sir Edward Codrington, and retired from Greece.  In return for these services Mehemet Ali claimed that the Pashalik of Syria should be added to his dominions.  The Sultan refused the request of his powerful vassal; but the latter picked a quarrel with the Turkish governor of Syria, and sent Ibrahim to invade the province.  Ibrahim not only made a triumphal entry into Damascus, but defeated the Turkish Army at Beilan and advanced into Asia p.  xviiMinor, where he routed a second force, sent against him by the Sultan, near Konia, in December 1832.  The defeated Turkish troops joined the Egyptians, Ibrahim advanced victoriously to Broussa, and had Constantinople at his mercy.  The Sultan in his extremity called the Russians to his assistance.  The Treaty of Unkiar Iskelesi was concluded in 1833; Ibrahim was obliged to retire, but the Pashaliks of Syria and Adana were given to Mehemet Ali, and treated with great rigour, as mentioned in chap.  xv.  At the time of Kinglakes visit to Egypt the plague seems to have been the one absorbing preoccupation of everyone in Cairo, and we learn little from him of the normal state of the country at this period.  The most remarkable of his Egyptian sayings is the prophecy at the end of the chapter called \"The Sphinx. \" \"The Englishman leaning far over to hold his loved India will plant a firm foot on the banks of the Nile and sit in the seats of the faithful. \" To have made this prediction at a time when India was still under the Company, when we had no interests in North-East Africa or the Red Sea, before the Suez Canal was a serious project, perhaps before we had occupied Aden, [xvii] is indeed an example of no ordinary political foresight.  Such was the political condition of the lands p.  xviiiwhich Kinglake visited, and of many aspects of which he gives a most living picture.  In his diverting preface he disclaims all intention of being instructive, of describing manners and customs, still less of discussing political and social questions.  Perhaps his narrative sometimes reminds the reader of his statement (chap.  viii. ) that a story may be false as a mere fact but perfectly true as an illustration.  Some great writers impart durability to their work by selecting from a mass of details such traits as are important and characteristic, and passing lightly over what is transitory.  For instance, the main impression left by Thackerays novels is not that the life there described is old-fashioned, but that it is in essentials the life of to-day.  So, too, in Eothen a reader acquainted with the East hardly notices anachronisms.  Judged as a description of the Levant of 1898, it is inaccurate, or rather inadequate, almost exclusively on account of its omissions.  But the principal descriptions, incidents, and portraits--the Mohammedan quarter at Belgrade, the conversation between the Pasha and the Dragoman, the meeting of the two Englishmen in the desert, Dimitri and Mysseri--are, if considered as types, as true to nature to-day as they were sixty years ago, and doubtless will be sixty years hence.  Kinglake treats the Levant in the only way it ought to be treated if it is to be enjoyed--half-seriously.  Those whom business or philanthropy p.  xixoblige to devote to it any real exertion, sentiment, or interest, lay up for themselves nothing but disillusion and disappointment, for, whether they are fascinated by the picturesque and manly virtues of the Moslems, or roused to honourable indignation by the slaughter and oppression of their fellow-Christians, they will find in the end that, as Lord Salisbury once said, they have put their money on the wrong horse.  In the Eastern Derby there are no winning horses.  One after another they have all disappointed their backers; the faults of Eastern Christendom brought about and still keep up the rule of the Turk, and few who have an adequate knowledge of the facts of the case believe either that the Christians are happy under that rule or that they furnish in themselves the elements of anything much better.  Yet this dreary tragedy--this daily round of oppression and misgovernment, varied by outbursts of interracial fury--has a brighter side.  To the mere spectator, to the intelligent traveller with literary taste and a sense of humour, the surface of Levantine life is a stream of perpetual amusement, often broadening into comedy, and sometimes bursting all bounds and breaking into a screaming farce.  The number and variety of races and languages afford infinite possibilities of misunderstanding and mistranslation (which it must be admitted are the basis of many good stories); the Orientalised European and the Europeanised Oriental are alike inexpressibly droll.  Their very crimes have an element of the burlesque, p.  xxwhich seems to disarm censure and remove the whole transaction to a non-moral sphere where ordinary rules of right and wrong do not apply.  The Turk, if not precisely witty himself, is at least the cause of wit in others.  Extreme Asiatic dignity amidst ludicrously undignified European surroundings, a mixture of pomp and homeliness, power and childishness, give rise to humorous anecdotes of a peculiar and very characteristic flavour, examples of which may be found in several works besides Eothen, notably Robert Curzons Monasteries of the Levant.  Another excellent illustration is supplied by Vazoffs Under the Yoke, a translation of which has been published in English.  It is an historical novel, written by a Bulgarian burning with indignation against the Ottoman rule.  Yet the Turkish Caimmakam, as drawn by a bitter enemy, is no bloody tyrant, but an exquisitely diverting old gentleman whose every appearance is hailed by the reader with impatient delight.  As the violence of the Turk, so also the dishonesty and corruption of the Rayah seem to lose their enormity when viewed in this gentle, humorous light.  The swindling is so palpable, and yet so gravely decorous in its external forms, that it ceases to shock; it is so universal that in the end no one seems to have suffered much wrong.  To vary the celebrated remark about the Scilly Islanders, one may say that these people gain a precarious livelihood by taking bribes from one another.  Again the elaborate and ceremonious phraseology essential to all p.  xxiliterary composition in the East enables a writer to make intrinsically preposterous assertions with a gravity which renders criticism impossible.  What reply can be given to the officials who assert that Armenians commit suicide in order to throw suspicion on certain excellent Kurds residing in their neighbourhood? or who when called upon to explain why they have incarcerated a foreign traveller under circumstances of extreme indignity, blandly reply that \"the said gentleman was indeed hospitably entertained in the Government buildings\"? This last instance shows that Oriental travelling must not be undertaken without due precautions.  A certain retinue, and sufficient influence to secure the courtesy of the authorities (which Kinglake evidently had), are essential.  With them the traveller acquires a feeling, often manifest in Eothen, that he is a sultan possessed of absolute authority over his surroundings.  There is just enough hardship to make comparative comfort seem luxury, just enough danger to make it pleasant, when all is over, to hear from what perils one has escaped.  Should, however, any reader be inclined to use Eothen as a practical manual, he must be cautious in following some of its precepts.  Kinglake constantly insists that intimidation, haughtiness, and defiance of all regulations are the only means of impressing Orientals; and chronicles with great satisfaction his own exploits in this line, concluding with \"the Surprise of Satalieh. \" What he says is true enough as long as the Oriental believes that the p.  xxiitraveller is a prince in his own country, and that any interference with his mad whims will bring severe punishment.  But unfortunately the secret is out.  Enlightened officials are well aware that many Englishmen are not cousins of the Queen, and have a shrewd suspicion that hindrances placed in the way of the prying European are not displeasing to the Imperial Government.  The \"Lord of London,\" who fifty years ago obtained a firman which made every provincial official bow before him, may now be kept waiting days or weeks for a travelling passport; and, unless he uses tact as well as bumptiousness, may find himself in a position to write to the Times about the interior of Turkish provincial prisons, and become the subject of a Blue Book.  Still even now, if travellers will be cautious and polite in dealing with people of whose language and customs they are profoundly ignorant, and not bluster unless they know very well what they are about (for I admit that bluster has its uses), they will find travelling more interesting, diverting, and enjoyable in the Levant than in any other part of the world.  I write these lines as I sit in the hall of the largest hotel in New York, a newly arrived stranger, somewhat dazed by the bustle and the glare.  The whole establishment is on a greater scale than anything else in the world--except its own bills.  Everything is made of gold and marble, including, I fancy, the food--at least this hypothesis plausibly reconciles the quality and texture of the viands with the value p.  xxiiithe vendors seem to attach to them.  Enormous lifts shoot their living freights up into spheres unseen, or engulf them in abysmal chasms.  All round people are ringing electric bells, telephoning, telegraphing, stenographing, polygraphing, and generally communicating their ideas about money to their fellow-creatures by any means rather than the voice which God put in the larynx for the purpose of quiet conversation.  On one side an operatic concert is being performed, on the other porters and luggage jostle a brilliant throng of fashionably dressed people.  It is as if someone had given an evening party at a railway station.  \"Whirr! whirr! all by wheels! whizz! whizz! all by steam!\" and electricity, as the immortal Pasha of Karagholookoldour would have said.  Now my mind (like the Pashas) comprehends locomotives, and I am an enthusiast for progress, but amidst all the whizz and whirr and ringing of electric bells, my memory turns somewhat regretfully to a hotel where I resided not long ago in the \"Exalted Country\"--that fine old Stambouls jargon is so much more soothing to the tongue than the strange abbreviations and initials they use over here--which was certainly more interesting, and not, I think, more uncomfortable than this Transatlantic Caravanserai.  Perhaps I shall write an introduction congenial to the Shade of Kinglake (if indeed the Shades are interested in new editions of their works) if instead of instituting a comparison between the Levant of to-day and of 1834, I recount a journey to the town p.  xxivof Karakeui in the year of grace 1898, and describe the local hotel.  Let not the reader in pursuit of that \"sound learning\" which Kinglake kept at arms length rashly identify Karakeui with the first town he finds on the map bearing that name.  The Turk has not a great variety of local designations.  When possible he adopts one from some other language, treating it with the scant courtesy which long-winded, infidel polysyllables deserve (e. g.  Edirne, Filibe, for Adrianople and Philippopoli); but when forced to have recourse to his own invention he calls most places Karakeui (or Blacktown), except those which are dubbed Oldtown, Newtown, or Whitetown.  It has been justly said that the East begins on the other side of Vienna, but, out of deference to the susceptibilities of the Magyars, who consider themselves in the van of civilisation, the Orient Express affects to be extremely European during its transit through Hungary.  It bustles and shakes, and is very uncomfortable.  In Servia it is more at its ease, though it still makes a pretence of thinking that time is money by only stopping ten minutes at every station.  In Bulgaria it ceases to imitate Western ways, and becomes frankly Oriental, reposing for half an hour at spots where there are no passengers and no traffic.  The part of the journey which lies on Turkish territory follows a singularly tortuous and corkscrew course, across a perfectly level plain which presents no obvious engineering difficulties.  The Porte confided the construction of this line to p.  xxvan eminent Israelite at a remuneration of so much for every kilometre built.  The eminent Israelite was straightway possessed by the spirit of his ancestors, and made a large fortune by laying the rails along a road as lengthy and complicated as that selected by Moses when he spent forty years in traversing a distance which anyone else can accomplish in a few days.  On arriving in Turkey we are at once seized by the representatives of the Board of Health.  After all, times have indeed changed since Eothen was written.  Instead of being put in quarantine by Europe, Turkey now puts Europe in quarantine.  It is true that good Moslems still hold that mens souls leave their bodies when God calls them, and count it impious to suppose that neglect or precaution can hasten or delay the Divine summons.  But though the Porte are not disposed to amend the sanitary condition of Mecca, they enforce quarantine regulations all round Constantinople with fanatical rigour.  This is due partly to the fears of the Palace, and partly, I think, to a sense of humour.  It is an excellent joke to apply a parody of European rules to Europeans in the name of sanitary science: to keep a set of fussy business people waiting a few days because they have come from a country which has not imposed quarantine on another country where there has been a doubtful case of cholera, or to detain a ship with a valuable cargo while embassies and merchants scream that thousands of pounds are being p.  xxvilost daily.  On the present occasion we are told we must wait a day under inspection, to see if we develop the symptoms of any terrible malady, and are accordingly lodged in damp little wooden huts on a muddy plain, where we are certainly likely to fall ill even if hale and hearty on arriving.  Turkish soldiers prevent us from crossing an imaginary line and contaminating the surrounding desert.  The quarantine doctor, however, explains to me that he has a peculiar respect for my character, sanitary and general, and would like to take a walk with me outside the limits of the establishment.  He has a remarkable pedigree.  His father was a Bohemian monk who found convent life too narrow for his taste, and accordingly embraced Islam.  Once within the true fold he made up for lost time by marrying as many wives as his new liberty allowed, and this is one of the results.  He confides to me that his one ambition is to wear decorations, and that in return for his civilities strangers of distinction have procured for him the orders of their respective countries.  The Siamese Minister, who recently passed through, made him a Commander of the Order of the White Elephant.  Could I not obtain for him the Order of the Garter? Doubtless I possess it myself.  With blushing mendacity I lead him to believe that I do, but explain that the distinction is only given to Englishmen and not to foreigners.  I see that he does not believe me, and meditates revenge.  Before we leave the quarantine station we have to be p.  xxviidisinfected.  The doctor attaches a garden hose to a reservoir filled with a fetid and corrosive fluid.  The victims are led up one by one by the military authorities as if to execution, and the jet is turned upon them, causing their garments to burst out into leprous spots.  I see by the doctors eye that he means to make me pay for my unfriendliness in the matter of the decoration, and therefore, casting scruple to the winds, I assure him that if he will only treat me gently he shall have the Fourth Class of the Garter.  He is at once all civility and consideration, and when I am led up in front of his infernal machine, directs an odoriferous douche to the right and left, leaving me unwetted in the middle.  Truly the way into Turkey is beset with as many difficulties as the road to paradise.  After the quarantine comes the Custom House.  The entry of most things is absolutely prohibited, and those which do enter pay a high duty.  Books are treated with incredible severity.  No work is allowed to pass the frontier which hints that the Turks were ever defeated, or that the Ottoman Government or the Mohammedan religion have any imperfections.  Turkish officials having found by experience that very little European literature comes up to their high standard, simply confiscate as \"seditious\" every publication which mentions Turkey or the Mohammedan East.  Eothen, even without the present highly seditious preface, is placed on the index, as are also Shakespeare, Byron, Dante, the p.  xxviiiEncyclopaedia Britannica, Baedeker, and Murray.  In practice, of course, certain familiar argumenta ad hominem modify this Draconian system, but even the golden key sometimes fails to open the door.  The officials watch one another, and know that they are much more likely to obtain a Turkish decoration by confiscating some infamous historian who is not ashamed to say that the Turks were once driven out of Hungary than they are to receive the Garter for letting his calumnies in.  But there is an end to all troubles, even on the Turkish frontier, and at last we are allowed to proceed to Karakeui, where I ultimately alight at the hotel.  Karakeui lies on a plateau, under a range of snowy mountains which glitter with strange distinctness in the pure translucent air.  A forest of minarets bears testimony to the piety of the place.  It is the sacred month of Ramazan, and at sunset they will be festooned with lights and blaze like columns of fire, while in the mosque below myriads of little oil lamps will shed their soft glow on the bowing crowds, the plashing fountains, and the names of saints and prophets blazoned on the walls in green and red.  In the streets is a motley throng of men and animals.  Strings of camels and pack-horses, dogs, sheep, and turkeys are mixed up with the human crowd.  Bulgarians and Servians quarrel in the bazaar, and denounce one another to the Turks.  They each claim exclusive rights over the only Christian Church, and the Governor, to end the dispute, has shut it up p.  xxixaltogether.  A few Greeks are occupied in making large fortunes, and are ready to expatiate on the Hellenic Idea, and to explain how, from a certain peculiar point of view, the late war may be regarded as a victory for Greece.  Albanians, armed with many weapons, and with moustaches as long as their own rifles, swagger through the crowd which respectfully makes way for them.  The hotel is kept by an Armenian, who left his native village on account of what are beautifully termed the \"events\" which occurred there.  Having been inspired by these occurrences with a wholesome respect for the followers of the Prophet, he is a little apt to recoup himself at the expense of his co-religionists; but the local Ottoman authorities, to whose care I am duly recommended as being \"one of those who wish well to the Sublime Government,\" have sternly informed him that I am not to be fleeced.  (I wonder if the Governor of New York would address a similar warning to the proprietor of this hotel. ) The establishment is constructed in the form of a quadrangle.  The central space is a quagmire, wherein are embedded, and, so to speak, held as hostages for payment, the vehicles in which the travellers have arrived.  The ground floor of the surrounding buildings is devoted to stabling.  Outside the first floor, and above the aforesaid quagmire, runs a gallery, from which open a number of cells, bare and whitewashed, devoid of all furniture, but, contrary to what might be expected, scrupulously p.  xxxclean.  A marble bath is not, as in New York, attached to each apartment, but in response to a suitable shout a boy brings a brass jug and basin, pours water over your hands and wipes them on an embroidered towel.  There is no table and no bed.  When you are disposed to sleep, a pile of rugs is spread on the floor.  If you want to write, you naturally sit on your heels and hold your paper in your hand--an attitude which, at least in the case of Europeans, tends to restrain exuberance and keep literary composition within due limits.  At meal times a little table like a high stool is brought in.  The guests squat round it on their heels, and eat with their fingers out of a large saucer set on a broad tin tray.  Turkish dinners consist of a quantity of dishes, generally at least seven or eight, and sometimes as many as twenty; but each is only tasted and rapidly removed.  At first it looks somewhat mysterious when people apparently wrap up some pieces of string in brown paper and eat the parcel with avidity.  But the string is cheese drawn out like very attenuated vermicelli, and the brown paper sheets of very thin bread which serve as a tablecloth and napkin as well as for food.  During Ramazan no Moslem may eat, drink, or smoke between sunrise and sunset.  The latter phenomenon is announced by a cannon, and some minutes before the gun fires a hungry crowd is gathered round the table waiting for the blessed sound.  Then follows half an hour of rapid, silent nutrition, for Turks do p.  xxxinot talk at table.  Afterwards, an hour or more of prayer; and then the earlier part of the night, until at least twelve or one, is devoted to visiting or attending the puppet show called Karagyoz.  [xxxi] Half an hour before dawn people go round the town beating drums, and the faithful hurriedly take a last meal before the morning cannon announces the dawn.  My neighbour in the room on the right is a spy appointed by the Imperial Government to watch over my doings.  He is a charming companion, and I fancy has a very pretty talent for the composition of imaginative literature.  My only regret is that I have never seen the daily reports which he draws up on my conduct.  They are, I believe, replete with incident, and are excellent specimens of a new and interesting variety of fiction.  The room on my left is occupied by the Christian Vice-Governor of the Province, who was appointed some months ago under immense pressure from the Powers, met by such resistance on the part of the Porte that one might have supposed his nomination was a deadly blow to the Turkish Empire.  It is a wise plan of the Portes never to make the most trivial concession without opposing a resistance, which is often successful, and always seems to enhance the importance of p.  xxxiithe point in dispute.  But the concession once made, means are soon discovered to deprive it of all its value, and the positions of victors and vanquished in the game prove to be reversed.  In the present case the Christian Vice-Governor found that none of his co-religionists were disposed to let him lodgings; and the local authorities, with a tender solicitude for his welfare, represented to him that there was a strong feeling against him in the town, and that he would be much more comfortable in the hotel; predicting (like Kinglakes prophet, Damoor) that if he went out into the streets, or meddled in the administration, he would arouse that excitable sentiment known as Mussulman religious feeling.  Like the Jews of Safet, the Christian Vice-Governor thought that the predictions of such practical men were not to be disregarded, and takes his ease in his inn with as good a grace as he can muster.  Another interesting occupant of the hotel is the Turkish inspector of Reforms.  To rightly understand the duties of this functionary it must be remembered that the Turkish Government is divided into two parts, which have no connection with one another: firstly, the real Government, which is hard to comprehend, but of which one gets a dim idea by observation on the spot; and secondly, the show Government, intended to impress Europe, and having as chief practical result the enrichment of telegraphic agencies.  Two common manifestations of the show Government are circulars to the Powers, and commissions despatched to the p.  xxxiiiProvinces to rectify abuses.  The present Commissioner has come to inspect reforms, and from the official language used respecting him it may be supposed that his mission is to tend and water the new institutions which are springing up like a luxuriant vegetation in a favourable climate, but at the same time to exercise a fatherly control, prevent the country from rushing into downright republicanism, and not permit the Christians to positively oppress their weaker Mohammedan brethren.  He is a very affable man, with a broad, smiling face, and an amiable rotundity of person which causes his gorgeous uniform to burst its buttons and gape at critical points.  He pays me long visits for the purpose of political discussion, being, as he calls it, tout a fait dans les idees liberales, and in order that this outpouring of radical views may not be interrupted, he brings a soldier to mount guard over the door.  No tortures could make me disclose the Commissioners confidences.  I will merely observe that the long fasts of Ramazan are irksome to an enlightened mind, and that liberal theologians hold that a mixture of brandy and champagne does not fall under the Prophets ban, inasmuch as it cannot accurately be described as either wine or spirits.  Very different is the room at the end of the passage.  No guard is needed here.  The door stands proudly open, and all the world may see that no crumb of bread or drop of water enters from sunrise to sunset.  In the middle of a low sofa sits, p.  xxxivcross-legged, a Hodja, clad in striped silk.  He is no ordinary country parson, but a noted preacher invited to tour in the provinces during Ramazan, and hold what in other countries would be called revival meetings.  His thin nervous face shows that he is not a real Turk.  Probably he is of Arab extraction, and in any case he burns with a Semitic indignation against those who \"ascribe companions to God. \" Round him sit in a solemn circle the notables of the town,--stout, devout men of the churchwarden order, who, to judge from the heavy sighs and puffs which they occasionally emit, do not share the Hodjas fierce joy in trampling on the desires of the flesh.  To-morrow he will preach in the Great Mosque with a sword in his hand, in token that the building was once a Christian Church and has been won from the infidel.  I tell the Commissioner for Reforms that I think this dangerous and injudicious.  He explains that the whole point of the ceremony lies in the fact that the sword is sheathed, as a token that religious discord is at an end, and that an era of mutual love and toleration has commenced.  But when I think of that nervous, fanatical face, the green garments, the ample turban, the amulets and the sword, I cannot help suspecting that it is better to be a Christian traveller than a Christian resident at Karakeui.  p.  xxxv Preface to the First Edition Addressed by the Author to One of His Friends When you first entertained the idea of travelling in the East you asked me to send you an outline of the tour which I had made, in order that you might the better be able to choose a route for yourself.  In answer to this request I gave you a large French map, on which the course of my journeys had been carefully marked; but I did not conceal from myself that this was rather a dry mode for a man to adopt when he wished to impart the results of his experience to a dear and intimate friend.  Now, long before the period of your planning an Oriental tour I had intended to write some account of my Eastern travels.  I had, indeed, begun the task, and had failed; I had begun it a second time, and failing again, had abandoned my attempt with a sensation of utter distaste.  I was unable to speak out, and chiefly, I think, for this reason, that I knew not to whom I was speaking.  It might be you, or perhaps our Lady of Bitterness, [xxxv] who would read my story, or it might be some member of the Royal p.  xxxviStatistical Society, and how on earth was I to write in a way that would do for all three? Well, your request for a sketch of my tour suggested to me the idea of complying with your wish by a revival of my twice-abandoned attempt.  I tried; and the pleasure and confidence which I felt in speaking to you soon made my task so easy, and even amusing, that after a while (though not in time for your tour) I completed the scrawl from which this book was originally printed.  The very feeling, however, which enabled me to write thus freely, prevented me from robing my thoughts in that grave and decorous style which I should have maintained if I had professed to lecture the public.  Whilst I feigned to myself that you, and you only, were listening, I could not by any possibility speak very solemnly.  Heaven forbid that I should talk to my own genial friend as though he were a great and enlightened community, or any other respectable aggregate! Yet I well understood that the mere fact of my professing to speak to you rather than to the public generally could not perfectly excuse me for printing a narrative too roughly worded, and accordingly, in revising the proof-sheets, I have struck out those phrases which seemed to be less fit for a published volume than for intimate conversation.  It is hardly to be expected, however, that correction of this kind should be perfectly complete, or that the almost boisterous tone in which many parts of the book were originally written should be thoroughly subdued.  I venture, therefore, to ask, that the familiarity of language still possibly apparent in the work may be laid to the account of our delightful intimacy, rather than to any presumptuous motive.  I feel, as you know, much too timidly, too distantly, and too p.  xxxviirespectfully toward the public to be capable of seeking to put myself on terms of easy fellowship with strange and casual readers.  It is right to forewarn people (and I have tried to do this as well as I can, by my studiously unpromising title-page) [xxxvii] that the book is quite superficial in its character.  I have endeavoured to discard from it all valuable matter derived from the works of others, and it appears to me that my efforts in this direction have been attended with great success.  I believe I may truly acknowledge that from all details of geographical discovery, or antiquarian research--from all display of \"sound learning and religious knowledge\"--from all historical and scientific illustrations--from all useful statistics--from all political disquisitions--and from all good moral reflections, the volume is thoroughly free.  My excuse for the book is its truth.  You and I know a man fond of hazarding elaborate jokes, who, whenever a story of his happens not to go down as wit, will evade the awkwardness of the failure by bravely maintaining that all he has said is pure fact.  I can honestly take this decent though humble mode of escape.  My narrative is not merely righteously exact in matters of fact (where fact is in question), but it is true in this larger sense--it conveys, not those impressions which ought to have been produced upon any \"well-constituted mind,\" but those which were really and truly received at the time of his rambles by a headstrong and not very amiable traveller, whose prejudices in favour of other peoples notions were then exceedingly slight.  As I have p.  xxxviiifelt, so I have written; and the result is, that there will often be found in my narrative a jarring discord between the associations properly belonging to interesting sites, and the tone in which I speak of them.  This seemingly perverse mode of treating the subject is forced upon me by my plan of adhering to sentimental truth, and really does not result from any impertinent wish to tease or trifle with readers.  I ought, for instance, to have felt as strongly in Judaea as in Galilee, but it was not so in fact.  The religious sentiment (born in solitude) which had heated my brain in the sanctuary of Nazareth was rudely chilled at the foot of Zion by disenchanting scenes, and this change is accordingly disclosed by the perfectly worldly tone in which I speak of Jerusalem and Bethlehem.  My notion of dwelling precisely upon those matters which happened to interest me, and upon none other, would of course be intolerable in a regular book of travels.  If I had been passing through countries not previously explored, it would have been sadly perverse to withhold careful descriptions of admirable objects merely because my own feelings of interest in them may have happened to flag; but where the countries which one visits have been thoroughly and ably described, and even artistically illustrated by others, one is fully at liberty to say as little (though not quite so much) as one chooses.  Now a traveller is a creature not always looking at sights; he remembers (how often!) the happy land of his birth; he has, too, his moments of humble enthusiasm about fire and food, about shade and drink; and if he gives to these feelings anything like the prominence which really belonged to them at the time of his travelling, he will not seem a very good teacher.  Once having determined to write the sheer truth concerning the things which chiefly have p.  xxxixinterested him, he must, and he will, sing a sadly long strain about self; he will talk for whole pages together about his bivouac fire, and ruin the ruins of Baalbec with eight or ten cold lines.  But it seems to me that this egotism of a traveller, however incessant, however shameless and obtrusive, must still convey some true ideas of the country through which he has passed.  His very selfishness, his habit of referring the whole external world to his own sensations, compels him, as it were, in his writings to observe the laws of perspective;--he tells you of objects, not as he knows them to be, but as they seemed to him.  The people and the things that most concern him personally, however mean and insignificant, take large proportions in his picture, because they stand so near to him.  He shows you his dragoman, and the gaunt features of his Arabs--his tent, his kneeling camels, his baggage strewed upon the sand; but the proper wonders of the land--the cities, the mighty ruins and monuments of bygone ages, he throws back faintly in the distance.  It is thus that he felt, and thus he strives to repeat the scenes of the Elder World.  You may listen to him for ever without learning much in the way of statistics; but, perhaps, if you bear with him long enough, you may find yourself slowly and faintly impressed with the realities of Eastern travel.  My scheme of refusing to dwell upon matters which failed to interest my own feelings has been departed from in one instance--namely, in my detail of the late Lady Hester Stanhopes conversation on supernatural topics.  The truth is, that I have been much questioned on this subject, and I thought that my best plan would be to write down at once all that I could ever have to say concerning the personage whose career has excited so much curiosity amongst p.  xlEnglishwomen.  The result is, that my account of the lady goes to a length which is not justified either by the importance of the subject, or by the extent to which it interested the narrator.  You will see that I constantly speak of \"my People,\" \"my Party,\" \"my Arabs,\" and so on, using terms which might possibly seem to imply that I moved about with a pompous retinue.  This of course was not the case.  I travelled with the simplicity proper to my station, as one of the industrious class, who was not flying from his country because of ennui, but was strengthening his will, and tempering the metal of his nature, for that life of toil and conflict in which he is now engaged.  But an Englishman journeying in the East must necessarily have with him dragomen capable of interpreting the Oriental languages; the absence of wheeled carriages obliges him to use several beasts of burthen for his baggage, as well as for himself and his attendants; the owners of the horses, or camels, with their slaves or servants, fall in as part of his train; and altogether, the cavalcade becomes rather numerous, without, however, occasioning any proportionate increase of expense.  When a traveller speaks of all these followers in mass, he calls them his \"people,\" or his \"troop,\" or his \"party,\" without intending to make you believe that he is therefore a Sovereign Prince.  You will see that I sometimes follow the custom of the Scots in describing my fellow-countrymen by the names of their paternal homes.  Of course all these explanations are meant for casual readers.  To you, without one syllable of excuse or deprecation, and in all the confidence of a friendship that never yet was clouded, I give the long-promised volume, and add but this one \"Goodbye!\" for I dare not stand greeting you here.  p.  1 CHAPTER I OVER THE BORDER At Semlin I still was encompassed by the scenes and the sounds of familiar life; the din of a busy world still vexed and cheered me; the unveiled faces of women still shone in the light of day.  Yet, whenever I chose to look southward, I saw the Ottomans fortress--austere, and darkly impending high over the vale of the Danube--historic Belgrade.  I had come, as it were, to the end of this wheel-going Europe, and now my eyes would see the splendour and havoc of the East.  The two frontier towns are less than a cannon-shot distant, and yet their people hold no communion.  The Hungarian on the north, and the Turk and Servian on the southern side of the Save are as much asunder as though there were fifty broad provinces that lay in the path between them.  Of the men p.  2that bustled around me in the streets of Semlin there was not, perhaps, one who had ever gone down to look upon the stranger race dwelling under the walls of that opposite castle.  It is the plague, and the dread of the plague, that divide the one people from the other.  All coming and going stands forbidden by the terrors of the yellow flag.  If you dare to break the laws of the quarantine, you will be tried with military haste; the court will scream out your sentence to you from a tribunal some fifty yards off; the priest, instead of gently whispering to you the sweet hopes of religion, will console you at duelling distance; and after that you will find yourself carefully shot, and carelessly buried in the ground of the lazaretto.  When all was in order for our departure we walked down to the precincts of the quarantine establishment, and here awaited us a \"compromised\" officer of the Austrian Government, who lives in a state of perpetual excommunication.  The boats, with their \"compromised\" rowers, were also in readiness.  After coming in contact with any creature or thing belonging to the Ottoman Empire it would be impossible for us to return to the Austrian territory without undergoing an imprisonment of fourteen days in the odious lazaretto.  We felt, therefore, that before we committed ourselves it was important to take care that none of the arrangements necessary for p.  3the journey had been forgotten; and in our anxiety to avoid such a misfortune, we managed the work of departure from Semlin with nearly as much solemnity as if we had been departing this life.  Some obliging persons, from whom we had received civilities during our short stay in the place, came down to say their farewell at the rivers side; and now, as we stood with them at the distance of three or four yards from the \"compromised\" officer, they asked if we were perfectly certain that we had wound up all our affairs in Christendom, and whether we had no parting requests to make.  We repeated the caution to our servants, and took anxious thought lest by any possibility we might be cut off from some cherished object of affection:--were they quite sure that nothing had been forgotten--that there was no fragrant dressing-case with its gold-compelling letters of credit from which we might be parting for ever?--No; all our treasures lay safely stowed in the boat, and we were ready to follow them to the ends of the earth.  Now, therefore, we shook hands with our Semlin friends, who immediately retreated for three or four paces, so as to leave us in the centre of a space between them and the \"compromised\" officer.  The latter then advanced, and asking once more if we had done with the civilised world, held forth his hand.  I met it with mine, and there was an end to Christendom for many a day to come.  We soon neared the southern bank of the river, but no sounds came down from the blank walls above, and there was no living thing that we could yet see, except one great hovering bird of the vulture race, flying low, and intent, and wheeling round and round over the pest-accursed city.  But presently there issued from the postern a group p.  4of human beings--beings with immortal souls, and possibly some reasoning faculties; but to me the grand point was this, that they had real, substantial, and incontrovertible turbans.  They made for the point towards which we were steering, and when at last I sprang upon the shore, I heard, and saw myself now first surrounded by men of Asiatic blood.  I have since ridden through the land of the Osmanlees, from the Servian border to the Golden Horn--from the Gulf of Satalieh to the tomb of Achilles; but never have I seen such ultra-Turkish looking fellows as those who received me on the banks of the Save.  They were men in the humblest order of life, having come to meet our boat in the hope of earning something by carrying our luggage up to the city; but poor though they were, it was plain that they were Turks of the proud old school, and had not yet forgotten the fierce, careless bearing of their once victorious race.  Though the province of Servia generally has obtained a kind of independence, yet Belgrade, as being a place of strength on the frontier, is still garrisoned by Turkish troops under the command of a Pasha.  Whether the fellows who now surrounded us were soldiers, or peaceful inhabitants, I did not understand: they wore the old Turkish costume; vests and jackets of many and brilliant colours, divided from the loose petticoat-trousers by heavy volumes of shawl, so thickly folded around their waists as to give the meagre wearers something of the dignity of true corpulence.  This cincture enclosed a whole bundle of weapons; no man bore less than one brace of immensely long pistols, and a yataghan (or cutlass), with a dagger or two of various shapes and sizes; most of these arms were p.  5inlaid with silver, and highly burnished, so that they contrasted shiningly with the decayed grandeur of the garments to which they were attached (this carefulness of his arms is a point of honour with the Osmanlee, who never allows his bright yataghan to suffer from his own adversity); then the long drooping mustachios, and the ample folds of the once white turbans, that lowered over the piercing eyes, and the haggard features of the men, gave them an air of gloomy pride, and that appearance of trying to be disdainful under difficulties, which I have since seen so often in those of the Ottoman people who live, and remember old times; they seemed as if they were thinking that they would have been more usefully, more honourably, and more piously employed in cutting our throats than in carrying our portmanteaus.  The faithful Steel (Methleys Yorkshire servant) stood aghast for a moment at the sight of his masters luggage upon the shoulders of these warlike porters, and when at last we began to move up he could scarcely avoid turning round to cast one affectionate look towards Christendom, but quickly again he marched on with steps of a man, not frightened exactly, but sternly prepared for death, or the Koran, or even for plural wives.  The Moslem quarter of a city is lonely and desolate.  You go up and down, and on over shelving and hillocky paths through the narrow lanes walled in by blank, windowless dwellings; you come out upon an open space strewed with the black ruins that some late fire has left; you pass by a mountain of castaway things, the rubbish of centuries, and on it you see numbers of big, wolflike dogs lying torpid under the sun, with limbs p.  6out-stretched to the full, as if they were dead; storks, or cranes, sitting fearless upon the low roofs, look gravely down upon you; the still air that you breathe is loaded with the scent of citron, and pomegranate rinds scorched by the sun, or (as you approach the bazaar) with the dry, dead perfume of strange spices.  You long for some signs of life, and tread the ground more heavily, as though you would wake the sleepers with the heel of your boot; but the foot falls noiseless upon the crumbling soil of an Eastern city, and silence follows you still.  Again and again you meet turbans, and faces of men, but they have nothing for you--no welcome--no wonder--no wrath--no scorn--they look upon you as we do upon a Decembers fall of snow--as a \"seasonable,\" unaccountable, uncomfortable work of God, that may have been sent for some good purpose, to be revealed hereafter.  Some people had come down to meet us with an invitation from the Pasha, and we wound our way up to the castle.  At the gates there were groups of soldiers, some smoking, and some lying flat like corpses upon the cool stones.  We went through courts, ascended steps, passed along a corridor, and walked into an airy, whitewashed room, with an European clock at one end of it, and Moostapha Pasha at the other; the fine, old, bearded potentate looked very like Jove--like Jove, too, in the midst of his clouds, for the silvery fumes of the narghile hung lightly circling round him.  The Pasha received us with the smooth, kind, p.  7gentle manner that belongs to well-bred Osmanlees; then he lightly clapped his hands, and instantly the sound filled all the lower end of the room with slaves; a syllable dropped from his lips which bowed all heads, and conjured away the attendants like ghosts (their coming and their going was thus swift and quiet, because their feet were bare, and they passed through no door, but only by the yielding folds of a purder).  Soon the coffee-bearers appeared, every man carrying separately his tiny cup in a small metal stand; and presently to each of us there came a pipe-bearer, who first rested the bowl of the tchibouque at a measured distance on the floor, and then, on this axis, wheeled round the long cheery stick, and gracefully presented it on half-bended knee; already the well-kindled fire was glowing secure in the bowl, and so, when I pressed the amber lip to mine, there was no coyness to conquer; the willing fume came up, and answered my slightest sigh, and followed softly every breath inspired, till it touched me with some faint sense and understanding of Asiatic contentment.  Asiatic contentment! Yet scarcely, perhaps, one hour before I had been wanting my bill, and ringing for waiters, in a shrill and busy hotel.  In the Ottoman dominions there is scarcely any hereditary influence except that which belongs to the family of the Sultan; and wealth, too, is a highly volatile blessing, not easily transmitted to the descendant of the owner.  From these causes it results that the people standing in the place of nobles p.  8and gentry are official personages, and though many (indeed the greater number) of these potentates are humbly born and bred, you will seldom, I think, find them wanting in that polished smoothness of manner, and those well-undulating tones which belong to the best Osmanlees.  The truth is, that most of the men in authority have risen from their humble station by the arts of the courtier, and they preserve in their high estate those gentle powers of fascination to which they owe their success.  Yet unless you can contrive to learn a little of the language, you will be rather bored by your visits of ceremony; the intervention of the interpreter, or dragoman as he is called, is fatal to the spirit of conversation.  I think I should mislead you if I were to attempt to give the substance of any particular conversation with Orientals.  A traveller may write and say that \"the Pasha of So-and-so was particularly interested in the vast progress which has been made in the application of steam, and appeared to understand the structure of our machinery--that he remarked upon the gigantic results of our manufacturing industry--showed that he possessed considerable knowledge of our Indian affairs, and of the constitution of the Company, and expressed a lively admiration of the many sterling qualities for which the people of England are distinguished. \" But the heap of commonplaces thus quietly attributed to the Pasha will have been founded perhaps on some such talking as this:-- Pasha. --The Englishman is welcome; most blessed among hours is this, the hour of his coming.  Dragoman (to the traveller). --The Pasha pays you his compliments.  Traveller. --Give him my best compliments in p.  9return, and say Im delighted to have the honour of seeing him.  Dragoman (to the Pasha). --His lordship, this Englishman, Lord of London, Scorner of Ireland, Suppressor of France, has quitted his governments, and left his enemies to breathe for a moment, and has crossed the broad waters in strict disguise, with a small but eternally faithful retinue of followers, in order that he might look upon the bright countenance of the Pasha among Pashas--the Pasha of the everlasting Pashalik of Karagholookoldour.  Traveller (to his dragoman). --What on earth have you been saying about London? The Pasha will be taking me for a mere cockney.  Have not I told you always to say that I am from a branch of the family of Mudcombe Park, and that I am to be a magistrate for the county of Bedfordshire, only Ive not qualified, and that I should have been a deputy-lieutenant if it had not been for the extraordinary conduct of Lord Mountpromise, and that I was a candidate for Goldborough at the last election, and that I should have won easy if my committee had not been bought.  I wish to Heaven that if you do say anything about me, youd tell the simple truth.  Dragoman [is silent].  Pasha. --What says the friendly Lord of London? is there aught that I can grant him within the Pashalik of Karagholookoldour? Dragoman (growing sulky and literal). --This friendly Englishman--this branch of Mudcombe--this head-purveyor of Goldborough--this possible policeman of Bedfordshire, is recounting his achievements, and the number of his titles.  Pasha. --The end of his honours is more distant than the ends of the earth, and the catalogue of p.  10his glorious deeds is brighter than the firmament of heaven! Dragoman (to the traveller). --The Pasha congratulates your Excellency.  Traveller. --About Goldborough? The deuce he does!--but I want to get at his views in relation to the present state of the Ottoman Empire.  Tell him the Houses of Parliament have met, and that there has been a speech from the throne, pledging England to preserve the integrity of the Sultans dominions.  Dragoman (to the Pasha). --This branch of Mudcombe, this possible policeman of Bedfordshire, informs your Highness that in England the talking houses have met, and that the integrity of the Sultans dominions has been assured for ever and ever by a speech from the velvet chair.  Pasha. --Wonderful chair! Wonderful houses!--whirr! whirr! all by wheels!--whiz! whiz! all by steam!--wonderful chair! wonderful houses! wonderful people!--whirr! whirr! all by wheels!--whiz! whiz! all by steam! Traveller (to the dragoman). --What does the Pasha mean by that whizzing? he does not mean to say, does he, that our Government will ever abandon their pledges to the Sultan? Dragoman. --No, your Excellency; but he says the English talk by wheels, and by steam.  Traveller. --Thats an exaggeration; but say that the English really have carried machinery to great perfection; tell the Pasha (hell be struck with that) that whenever we have any disturbances to put down, even at two or three hundred miles from London, we can send troops by the thousand to the scene of action in a few hours.  Dragoman (recovering his temper and freedom of p.  11speech). --His Excellency, this Lord of Mudcombe, observes to your Highness, that whenever the Irish, or the French, or the Indians rebel against the English, whole armies of soldiers, and brigades of artillery, are dropped into a mighty chasm called Euston Square, and in the biting of a cartridge they arise up again in Manchester, or Dublin, or Paris, or Delhi, and utterly exterminate the enemies of England from the face of the earth.  Pasha. --I know it--I know all--the particulars have been faithfully related to me, and my mind comprehends locomotives.  The armies of the English ride upon the vapours of boiling caldrons, and their horses are flaming coals!--whirr! whirr! all by wheels!--whiz! whiz! all by steam! Traveller (to his dragoman). --I wish to have the opinion of an unprejudiced Ottoman gentleman as to the prospects of our English commerce and manufactures; just ask the Pasha to give me his views on the subject.  Pasha (after having received the communication of the dragoman). --The ships of the English swarm like flies; their printed calicoes cover the whole earth; and by the side of their swords the blades of Damascus are blades of grass.  All India is but an item in the ledger-books of the merchants, whose lumber-rooms are filled with ancient thrones!--whirr! whirr! all by wheels!--whiz! whiz! all by steam! Dragoman. --The Pasha compliments the cutlery of England, and also the East India Company.  Traveller. --The Pashas right about the cutlery (I tried my scimitar with the common officers swords belonging to our fellows at Malta, and they cut it like the leaf of a novel).  Well (to the p.  12dragoman), tell the Pasha I am exceedingly gratified to find that he entertains such a high opinion of our manufacturing energy, but I should like him to know, though, that we have got something in England besides that.  These foreigners are always fancying that we have nothing but ships, and railways, and East India Companies; do just tell the Pasha that our rural districts deserve his attention, and that even within the last two hundred years there has been an evident improvement in the culture of the turnip, and if he does not take any interest about that, at all events you can explain that we have our virtues in the country--that we are a truth-telling people, and, like the Osmanlees, are faithful in the performance of our promises.  Oh! and, by the bye, whilst you are about it, you may as well just say at the end that the British yeoman is still, thank God! the British yeoman.  Pasha (after hearing the dragoman). --It is true, it is true:--through all Feringhistan the English are foremost and best; for the Russians are drilled swine, and the Germans are sleeping babes, and the Italians are the servants of songs, and the French are the sons of newspapers, and the Greeks they are weavers of lies, but the English and the Osmanlees are brothers together in righteousness; for the Osmanlees believe in one only God, and cleave to the Koran, and destroy idols; so do the English worship one God, and abominate graven images, and tell the truth, and believe in a book, and though they drink the juice of the grape, yet to say that they worship their prophet as God, or to say that they are eaters of pork, these are lies--lies born of Greeks, and nursed by Jews! Dragoman. --The Pasha compliments the English.  p.  13Traveller (rising). --Well, Ive had enough of this.  Tell the Pasha I am greatly obliged to him for his hospitality, and still more for his kindness in furnishing me with horses, and say that now I must be off.  Pasha (after hearing the dragoman, and standing up on his divan). --Proud are the sires, and blessed are the dams of the horses that shall carry his Excellency to the end of his prosperous journey.  May the saddle beneath him glide down to the gates of the happy city, like a boat swimming on the third river of Paradise.  May he sleep the sleep of a child, when his friends are around him; and the while that his enemies are abroad, may his eyes flame red through the darkness--more red than the eyes of ten tigers! Farewell! Dragoman. --The Pasha wishes your Excellency a pleasant journey.  So ends the visit.  p.  14 CHAPTER II TURKISH TRAVELLING In two or three hours our party was ready; the servants, the Tatar, the mounted Suridgees, [14a] and the baggage-horses, altogether made up a strong cavalcade.  The accomplished Mysseri, [14b] of whom you have heard me speak so often, and who served me so faithfully throughout my Oriental journeys, acted as our interpreter, and was, in fact, the brain of our corps.  The Tatar, you know, is a Government courier properly employed in carrying despatches, but also sent with travellers to speed them on their way, and answer with his head for their safety.  The man whose head was thus pledged for our precious lives was a glorious-looking fellow, with the regular and handsome cast of countenance which is now characteristic of the Ottoman race.  [14c] His features displayed p.  15a good deal of serene pride, self-respect, fortitude, a kind of ingenuous sensuality, and something of instinctive wisdom, without any sharpness of intellect.  He had been a Janissary (as I afterwards found), and kept up the odd strut of his old corps, which used to affright the Christians in former times--that rolling gait so comically pompous, that a close imitation of it, even in the broadest farce, would be looked upon as a very rough over-acting of the character.  It is occasioned in part by dress and accoutrements.  The weighty bundle of weapons carried upon the chest throws back the body so as to give it a wonderful portliness, and, moreover, the immense masses of clothes that swathe his limbs force the wearer in walking to swing himself heavily round from left to right, and from right to left.  In truth, this great edifice of woollen, and cotton, and silk, and silver, and brass, and steel is not at all fitted for moving on foot; it cannot even walk without frightfully discomposing its fair proportions; and as to running--our Tatar ran once (it was in order to pick up a partridge that Methley had winged with a pistol-shot), and really the attempt was one of the funniest misdirections of human energy that wondering man ever saw.  But put him in his stirrups, and then is the Tatar himself again: there he lives at his pleasure, reposing in the tranquillity of that true home (the home of his ancestors) which the saddle seems to afford him, and drawing from his pipe the calm pleasures of his \"own fireside,\" or else dashing sudden over the earth, as though for a moment he felt the mouth of a Turcoman steed, and saw his own Scythian plains lying boundless and open before him.  It was not till his subordinates had nearly completed their preparations for their march that our p.  16Tatar, \"commanding the forces,\" arrived; he came sleek and fresh from the bath (for so is the custom of the Ottomans when they start upon a journey), and was carefully accoutred at every point.  From his thigh to his throat he was loaded with arms and other implements of a campaigning life.  There is no scarcity of water along the whole road from Belgrade to Stamboul, but the habits of our Tatar were formed by his ancestors and not by himself, so he took good care to see that his leathern water-flask was amply charged and properly strapped to the saddle, along with his blessed tchibouque.  And now at last he has cursed the Suridgees in all proper figures of speech, and is ready for a ride of a thousand miles; but before he comforts his soul in the marble baths of Stamboul he will be another and a lesser man; his sense of responsibility, his too strict abstemiousness, and his restless energy, disdainful of sleep, will have worn him down to a fraction of the sleek Moostapha that now leads out our party from the gates of Belgrade.  The Suridgees are the men employed to lead the baggage-horses.  They are most of them gipsies.  Their lot is a sad one: they are the last of the human race, and all the sins of their superiors (including the horses) can safely be visited on them.  But the wretched look often more picturesque than their betters; and though all the world despise these poor Suridgees, their tawny skins and their grisly beards will gain them honourable standing in the foreground of a landscape.  We had a couple of these fellows with us, each leading a baggage-horse, to the tail of which last another baggage-horse was attached.  There was a world of trouble in persuading the stiff angular portmanteaus of Europe to adapt themselves p.  17to their new condition and sit quietly on pack-saddles, but all was right at last, and it gladdened my eyes to see our little troop file off through the winding lanes of the city, and show down brightly in the plain beneath.  The one of our party that seemed to be most out of keeping with the rest of the scene was Methleys Yorkshire servant, who always rode doggedly on in his pantry jacket, looking out for \"gentlemens seats. \" Methley and I had English saddles, but I think we should have done just as well (I should certainly have seen more of the country) if we had adopted saddles like that of our Tatar, who towered so loftily over the scraggy little beast that carried him.  In taking thought for the East, whilst in England, I had made one capital hit which you must not forget--I had brought with me a pair of common spurs.  These were a great comfort to me throughout my horseback travels, by keeping up the cheerfulness of the many unhappy nags that I had to bestride; the angle of the Oriental stirrup is a very poor substitute for spurs.  The Ottoman horseman, raised by his saddle to a great height above the humble level of the back that he bestrides, and using an awfully sharp bit, is able to lift the crest of his nag, and force him into a strangely fast shuffling walk, the orthodox pace for the journey.  My comrade and I, using English saddles, could not easily keep our beasts up to this peculiar amble; besides, we thought it a bore to be followed by our attendants for a thousand miles, and we generally, therefore, did duty as the rearguard of our \"grand army\"; we used to walk our horses till the party in front had got into the distance, and then retrieve the lost ground by a gallop.  We had ridden on for some two or three hours; p.  18the stir and bustle of our commencing journey had ceased, the liveliness of our little troop had worn off with the declining day, and the night closed in as we entered the great Servian forest.  Through this our road was to last for more than a hundred miles.  Endless, and endless now on either side, the tall oaks closed in their ranks and stood gloomily lowering over us, as grim as an army of giants with a thousand years pay in arrear.  One strived with listening ear to catch some tidings of that forest world within--some stirring of beasts, some night-birds scream, but all was quite hushed, except the voice of the cicalas that peopled every bough, and filled the depths of the forest through and through, with one same hum everlasting--more stilling than very silence.  At first our way was in darkness, but after a while the moon got up, and touched the glittering arms and tawny faces of our men with light so pale and mystic, that the watchful Tatar felt bound to look out for demons, and take proper means for keeping them off; forthwith he determined that the duty of frightening away our ghostly enemies (like every other troublesome work) should fall upon the poor Suridgees, who accordingly lifted up their voices, and burst upon the dreadful stillness of the forest with shrieks and dismal howls.  These precautions were kept up incessantly, and were followed by the most complete success, for not one demon came near us.  Long before midnight we reached the hamlet in which we were to rest for the night; it was made up of about a dozen clay huts, standing upon a small tract of ground hardly won from the forest.  The peasants that lived there spoke a Slavonic dialect, and Mysseris knowledge of the Russian tongue enabled him to talk with them freely.  We took up our p.  19quarters in a square room with white walls and an earthen floor, quite bare of furniture, and utterly void of women.  They told us, however, that these Servian villagers lived in happy abundance, but that they were careful to conceal their riches, as well as their wives.  The burthens unstrapped from the pack-saddles very quickly furnished our den; a couple of quilts spread upon the floor, with a carpet-bag at the head of each, became capital sofas--portmanteaus, and hat-boxes, and writing-cases, and books, and maps, and gleaming arms soon lay strewed around us in pleasant confusion.  Mysseris canteen too began to yield up its treasures, but we relied upon finding some provisions in the village.  At first the natives declared that their hens were mere old maids and all their cows unmarried; but our Tatar swore such a grand sonorous oath, and fingered the hilt of his yataghan with such persuasive touch, that the land soon flowed with milk, and mountains of eggs arose.  And soon there was tea before us, with all its unspeakable fragrance, and as we reclined on the floor, we found that a portmanteau was just the right height for a table; the duty of candlesticks was ably performed by a couple of intelligent natives; the rest of the villagers stood by the open doorway at the lower end of the room, and watched our banqueting with grave and devout attention.  The first night of your first campaign (though you be but a mere peaceful campaigner) is a glorious time in your life.  It is so sweet to find ones self free from the stale civilisation of Europe! Oh, my dear ally, when first you spread your carpet in the midst of these Eastern scenes, do think for a moment of those your fellow-creatures, that dwell in squares, p.  20and streets, and even (for such is the fate of many!) in actual country houses; think of the people that are \"presenting their compliments,\" and \"requesting the honour,\" and \"much regretting,\"--of those that are pinioned at dinner-tables, or stuck up in ballrooms, or cruelly planted in pews,--ay, think of these, and so remembering how many poor devils are living in a state of utter respectability, you will glory the more in your own delightful escape.  I am bound to confess, however, that with all its charms a mud floor (like a mercenary match) does certainly promote early rising.  Long before daybreak we were up, and had breakfasted; after this there was nearly a whole tedious hour to endure whilst the horses were laden by torchlight; but this had an end, and at last we went on once more.  Cloaked, and sombre, at first we made our sullen way through the darkness, with scarcely one barter of words; but soon the genial morn burst down from heaven, and stirred the blood so gladly through our veins, that the very Suridgees, with all their troubles, could now look up for an instant, and almost seem to believe in the temporary goodness of God.  The actual movement from one place to another, in Europeanised countries, is a process so temporary--it occupies, I mean, so small a proportion of the travellers entire time--that his mind remains unsettled, so long as the wheels are going; he may be alive enough to external objects of interest, and to the crowding ideas which are often invited by the excitement of a changing scene, but he is still conscious of being in a provisional state, and his mind is constantly recurring to the expected end of his journey; his ordinary ways of thought have been interrupted, and before any new mental habits can be p.  21formed he is quietly fixed in his hotel.  It will be otherwise with you when you journey in the East.  Day after day, perhaps week after week and month after month, your foot is in the stirrup.  To taste the cold breath of the earliest morn, and to lead, or follow, your bright cavalcade till sunset through forests and mountain passes, through valleys and desolate plains, all this becomes your mode of life, and you ride, eat, drink, and curse the mosquitoes as systematically as your friends in England eat, drink, and sleep.  If you are wise, you will not look upon the long period of time thus occupied in actual movement as the mere gulf dividing you from the end of your journey, but rather as one of those rare and plastic seasons of your life from which, perhaps, in after times you may love to date the moulding of your character--that is, your very identity.  Once feel this, and you will soon grow happy and contented in your saddle-home.  As for me and my comrade, however, in this part of our journey we often forgot Stamboul, forgot all the Ottoman Empire, and only remembered old times.  We went back, loitering on the banks of Thames--not grim old Thames of \"after life,\" that washes the Parliament Houses, and drowns despairing girl--but Thames, the \"old Eton fellow,\" that wrestled with us in our boyhood till he taught us to be stronger than he.  We bullied Keate, and scoffed at Larry Miller, and Okes; we rode along loudly laughing, and talked to the grave Servian forest as though it were the \"Brocas clump. \" Our pace was commonly very slow, for the baggage-horses served us for a drag, and kept us to a rate of little more than five miles in the hour, but now and then, and chiefly at night, a spirit of movement p.  22would suddenly animate the whole party; the baggage-horses would be teased into a gallop, and when once this was done, there would be such a banging of portmanteaus, and such convulsions of carpet-bags upon their panting sides, and the Suridgees would follow them up with such a hurricane of blows, and screams, and curses, that stopping or relaxing was scarcely possible; then the rest of us would put our horses into a gallop, and so, all shouting cheerily, would hunt, and drive the sumpter beasts like a flock of goats, up hill and down dale, right on to the end of their journey.  The distances at which we got relays of horses varied greatly; some were not more than fifteen or twenty miles, but twice, I think, we performed a whole days journey of more than sixty miles with the same beasts.  When at last we came out from the forest our road lay through scenes like those of an English park.  The green sward unfenced, and left to the free pasture of cattle, was dotted with groups of stately trees, and here and there darkened over with larger masses of wood, that seemed gathered together for bounding the domain, and shutting out some \"infernal\" fellow-creature in the shape of a newly made squire; in one or two spots the hanging copses looked down upon a lawn below with such sheltering mien, that seeing the like in England you would have been tempted almost to ask the name of the spendthrift, or the madman who had dared to pull down \"the old hall. \" There are few countries less infested by \"lions\" than the provinces on this part of your route.  You are not called upon to \"drop a tear\" over the tomb of \"the once brilliant\" anybody, or to pay your p.  23\"tribute of respect\" to anything dead or alive.  There are no Servian or Bulgarian litterateurs with whom it would be positively disgraceful not to form an acquaintance; you have no staring, no praising to get through; the only public building of any interest that lies on the road is of modern date, but is said to be a good specimen of Oriental architecture; it is of a pyramidical shape, and is made up of thirty thousand skulls, contributed by the rebellious Servians in the early part (I believe) of this century: I am not at all sure of my date, but I fancy it was in the year 1806 that the first skull was laid.  I am ashamed to say that in the darkness of the early morning we unknowingly went by the neighbourhood of this triumph of art, and so basely got off from admiring \"the simple grandeur of the architects conception,\" and \"the exquisite beauty of the fretwork. \" There being no \"lions,\" we ought at least to have met with a few perils, but the only robbers we saw anything of had been long since dead and gone.  The poor fellows had been impaled upon high poles, and so propped up by the transverse spokes beneath them, that their skeletons, clothed with some white, p.  24wax-like remains of flesh, still sat up lolling in the sunshine, and listlessly stared without eyes.  One day it seemed to me that our path was a little more rugged than usual, and I found that I was deserving for myself the title of Sabalkansky, or \"Transcender of the Balcan. \" The truth is, that, as a military barrier, the Balcan is a fabulous mountain.  Such seems to be the view of Major Keppell, who looked on it towards the east with the eye of a soldier, and certainly in the Sophia Pass, which I followed, there is no narrow defile, and no ascent sufficiently difficult to stop, or delay for long time, a train of siege artillery.  Before we reached Adrianople, Methley had been seized with we knew not what ailment, and when we had taken up our quarters in the city he was cast to the very earth by sickness.  Andrianople enjoyed an English consul, and I felt sure that, in Eastern phrase, his house would cease to be his house, and would become the house of my sick comrade.  I should have judged rightly under ordinary circumstances, but the levelling plague was abroad, and the dread of it had dominion over the consular mind.  So now (whether dying or not, one could hardly tell), upon a quilt stretched out along the floor, there lay the best hope of an ancient line, without the material aids to comfort of even the humblest sort, and (sad to say) without the consolation of a friend, or even a comrade worth having.  I have a notion that tenderness and pity are affections occasioned in some measure by living within doors; certainly, at the time I speak of, the open-air life which I have been leading, or the wayfaring hardships of the journey, had so strangely blunted me, that I felt intolerant of illness, and looked down upon my companion as if the poor fellow in p.  25falling ill had betrayed a want of spirit.  I entertained, too, a most absurd idea--an idea that his illness was partly affected.  You see that I have made a confession: this I hope--that I may always hereafter look charitably upon the hard, savage acts of peasants, and the cruelties of a \"brutal\" soldiery.  God knows that I strived to melt myself into common charity, and to put on a gentleness which I could not feel, but this attempt did not cheat the keenness of the sufferer; he could not have felt the less deserted because that I was with him.  We called to aid a solemn Armenian (I think he was), half soothsayer, half hakim or doctor, who, all the while counting his beads, fixed his eyes steadily upon the patient, and then suddenly dealt him a violent blow on the chest.  Methley bravely dissembled his pain, for he fancied that the blow was meant to try whether or not the plague were on him.  Here was really a sad embarrassment--no bed; nothing to offer the invalid in the shape of food save a piece of thin, tough, flexible, drab-coloured cloth, made of flour and mill-stones in equal proportions, and called by the name of \"bread\"; then the patient, of course, had no \"confidence in his medical man,\" and on the whole, the best chance of saving my comrade seemed to lie in taking him out of the reach of his doctor, and bearing him away to the neighbourhood of some more genial consul.  But how was this to be done? Methley was much too ill to be kept in his saddle, and wheel carriages, as means of travelling, were unknown.  There is, however, such a thing as an \"araba,\" a vehicle drawn by oxen, in which the wives of a rich man are sometimes dragged four or five miles over the grass by p.  26way of recreation.  The carriage is rudely framed, but you recognise in the simple grandeur of its design a likeness to things majestic; in short, if your carpenters son were to make a \"Lord Mayors coach\" for little Amy, he would build a carriage very much in the style of a Turkish araba.  No one had ever heard of horses being used for drawing a carriage in this part of the world, but necessity is the mother of innovation as well as of invention.  I was fully justified, I think, in arguing that there were numerous instances of horses being used for that purpose in our own country--that the laws of nature are uniform in their operation over all the world (except Ireland)--that that which was true in Piccadilly, must be true in Adrianople--that the matter could not fairly be treated as an ecclesiastical question, for that the circumstance of Methleys going on to Stamboul in an araba drawn by horses, when calmly and dispassionately considered, would appear to be perfectly consistent with the maintenance of the Mahometan religion as by law established.  Thus poor, dear, patient Reason would have fought her slow battle against Asiatic prejudice, and I am convinced that she would have established the possibility (and perhaps even the propriety) of harnessing horses in a hundred and fifty years; but in the meantime Mysseri, well seconded by our Tatar, put a very quick end to the controversy by having the horses put to.  It was a sore thing for me to see my poor comrade brought to this, for young though he was, he was a veteran in travel.  When scarcely yet of age he had invaded India from the frontiers of Russia, and that so swiftly, that measuring by the time of his flight the broad dominions of the king of kings were p.  27shrivelled up to a dukedom, and now, poor fellow, he was to be poked into an araba, like a Georgian girl! He suffered greatly, for there were no springs for the carriage, and no road for the wheels; and so the concern jolted on over the open country with such twists, and jerks, and jumps, as might almost dislocate the supple tongue of Satan.  All day the patient kept himself shut up within the lattice-work of the araba, and I could hardly know how he was faring until the end of the days journey, when I found that he was not worse, and was buoyed up with the hope of some day reaching Constantinople.  I was always conning over my maps, and fancied that I knew pretty well my line, but after Adrianople I had made more southing than I knew for, and it was with unbelieving wonder, and delight, that I came suddenly upon the shore of the sea.  A little while, and its gentle billows were flowing beneath the hoofs of my beast; but the hearing of the ripple was not enough communion, and the seeing of the blue Propontis was not to know and possess it--I must needs plunge into its depth and quench my longing love in the palpable waves; and so when old Moostapha (defender against demons) looked round for his charge, he saw with horror and dismay that he for whose life his own life stood pledged was possessed of some devil who had driven him down into the sea--that the rider and the steed had vanished from earth, and that out among the waves was the gasping crest of a post-horse, and the ghostly head of the Englishman moving upon the face of the waters.  We started very early indeed on the last day of our journey, and from the moment of being off until p.  28we gained the shelter of the imperial walls we were struggling face to face with an icy storm that swept right down from the steppes of Tartary, keen, fierce, and steady as a northern conqueror.  Methleys servant, who was the greatest sufferer, kept his saddle until we reached Stamboul, but was then found to be quite benumbed in limbs, and his brain was so much affected that when he was lifted from his horse he fell away in a state of unconsciousness, the first stage of a dangerous fever.  Our Tatar, worn down by care and toil, and carrying seven heavens full of water in his manifold jackets and shawls, was a mere weak and vapid dilution of the sleek Moostapha, who scarce more than one fortnight before came out like a bridegroom from his chamber to take the command of our party.  Mysseri seemed somewhat over-wearied, but he had lost none of his strangely quiet energy.  He wore a grave look, however, for he now had learnt that the plague was prevailing at Constantinople, and he was fearing that our two sick men, and the miserable looks of our whole party, might make us unwelcome at Pera.  We crossed the Golden Horn in a caique.  As soon as we had landed, some woebegone-looking fellows were got together and laden with our baggage.  Then on we went, dripping, and sloshing, and looking very like men that had been turned back by the Royal Humane Society as being incurably drowned.  Supporting our sick, we climbed up shelving steps and threaded many windings, and at last came up into the main street of Pera, humbly hoping that we might not be judged guilty of plague, and so be cast back with horror from the doors of the shuddering Christians.  p.  29Such was the condition of our party, which fifteen days before had filed away so gaily from the gates of Belgrade.  A couple of fevers and a north-easterly storm had thoroughly spoiled our looks.  The interest of Mysseri with the house of Giuseppini was too powerful to be denied, and at once, though not without fear and trembling, we were admitted as guests.  p.  30 CHAPTER III CONSTANTINOPLE Even if we dont take a part in the chant about \"mosques and minarets,\" we can still yield praises to Stamboul.  We can chant about the harbour; we can say, and sing, that nowhere else does the sea come so home to a city; there are no pebbly shores--no sand bars--no slimy river-beds--no black canals--no locks nor docks to divide the very heart of the place from the deep waters.  If being in the noisiest mart of Stamboul you would stroll to the quiet side of the way amidst those cypresses opposite, you will cross the fathomless Bosphorus; if you would go from your hotel to the bazaars, you must go by the bright, blue pathway of the Golden Horn, that can carry a thousand sail of the line.  You are accustomed to the gondolas that glide among the palaces of St.  Mark, but here at Stamboul it is a 120-gun ship that meets you in the street.  Venice strains out from the steadfast land, and in old times would send forth the chief of the State to woo and wed the reluctant sea; but the stormy bride of the Doge is the bowing slave of the Sultan.  She comes to his feet with the treasures of the world--she bears him from palace to palace--by some unfailing witchcraft she entices the breezes to p.  31follow her and fan the pale cheek of her lord--she lifts his armed navies to the very gates of his garden--she watches the walls of his serai--she stifles the intrigues of his ministers--she quiets the scandals of his courts--she extinguishes his rivals, and hushes his naughty wives all one by one.  So vast are the wonders of the deep! All the while that I stayed at Constantinople the plague was prevailing, but not with any degree of violence.  Its presence, however, lent a mysterious and exciting, though not very pleasant, interest to my first knowledge of a great Oriental city; it gave tone and colour to all I saw, and all I felt--a tone and a colour sombre enough, but true, and well befitting the dreary monuments of past power and splendour.  With all that is most truly Oriental in its character the plague is associated; it dwells with the faithful in the holiest quarters of their city.  The coats and the hats of Pera are held to be nearly as innocent of infection as they are ugly in shape and fashion; but the rich furs and the costly shawls, the broidered slippers and the gold-laden saddle-cloths, the fragrance of burning aloes and the rich aroma of patchouli--these are the signs that mark the familiar home of plague.  You go out from your queenly London--the centre of the greatest and strongest amongst all earthly dominions--you go out thence, and travel on to the capital of an Eastern Prince, you find but a waning power, and a faded splendour, that inclines you to laugh and mock; but let the infernal Angel of Plague be at hand, and he, more mighty than armies, more terrible than Suleyman in his glory, can p.  32restore such pomp and majesty to the weakness of the Imperial city, that if, when HE is there, you must still go prying amongst the shades of this dead empire, at least you will tread the path with seemly reverence and awe.  It is the firm faith of almost all the Europeans living in the East that plague is conveyed by the touch of infected substances, and that the deadly atoms especially lurk in all kinds of clothes and furs.  It is held safer to breathe the same air with a man sick of the plague, and even to come in contact wi", "article_2": "Alexander William Kinglakes travelogue Eothen (1844) is bookended by plague.

Through haunted Balkan woods and the Alexander William Kinglakes travelogue Eothen (1844) is bookended by plague.  It opens with a grim view from the Austrian-held side of the Sava river to Ottoman Belgrade on the other bank, where the yellow flag of contagion flies above the battlements.  It ends in the epidemic hell of Cairo where every other person Kinglake meets will be dead in three days.  Between these two chapters Eothen unfolds with an authentic air of early nineteenth-century Romanticism.  Through haunted Balkan woods and the crowded alleys of ancient eastern cities, through desert wastes and trackless mountains of red stone, Kinglake and his small band press on.  He visits ruined temples and holy sites.  He smokes from narghiles in the palaces of the mighty and dines in the tents of the Bedouin.  He risks life and limb - his own and those of his hired companions - on more occasions than one.  Along the way he reinvents travel writing, or at least he's commonly credited with doing so.  Kinglake is determined not be your tour guide and Eothen is not a guidebook for would-be vacationers.  He will not inform, uplift, or humor you.  In his introduction he writes: \"I have endeavored to discard from [my book] all valuable matter derived from the works of others, and it appears to me that my efforts in this direction have been attended with great success; I believe that I may truly acknowledge that from all details of geographical discovery or antiquarian research, from all display of 'sound learning and religious knowledge, from all historical and scientific illustrations, from all useful statistics, from all political disquisitions, and from all good moral reflections, the volume is thoroughly free. \" What he provides in place of these is the straightforward (occasionally \"insolent\") record of his personal experience and impressions.  His book is less an education than an entertainment.  In this respect, although Eothen strongly influenced so much of the travel writing that followed it, it's not really so much a reinvention of the travel book but a return to the sort of pre-Enlightenment travelogues of Marco Polo or Sir John Mandeville (assuming the latter was a real person).  The most memorable parts of the book, I think, include the chapter describing Kinglakes visit to Lady Hester Stanhope in the mountains of Lebanon, where the elderly London society girl now lives a hermits life in a fortified monastery with a small army at her command, and with a strong belief in her own occult powers and divine nature.  In another favorite passage, Kinglake describes the psychological inversion he experienced stepping into the very landscape of myth near the site of Troy: \"You force yourself hardily into the material presence of a mountain or river whose name belongs to poetry and ancient religion, rather than to the external world; your feelings, wound up and kept ready for some sort of half-expected rapture, are chilled and borne for the time under all this load of real earth and water; but let these once pass out of sight, and then again the old fanciful notions are restored, and the mere realities which you have just been looking at are thrown back so far into distance that the very event of your intrusion upon such scenes begins to look dim and uncertain, as though it belonged to mythology. \" The chapters covering Cairo in a season of plague, however, feel especially timely just now, as we wrap up (hopefully) our own season of COVID.  Kinglakes story illustrates, at least, how much worse things can get in an epidemic.  \"The fear of the plague is its forerunner,\" he writes, and though weve had, on balance, much less to fear than Kinglake himself and the residents of Cairo at the time, we see that fear may also be the last symptom to finally quit us.  Then, as now, there were the fatalistic, the careless, and the paranoid.  Kinglake describes the constant terror suffered by those convinced the plague may be spread by touch, before the germ theory of disease proved them right: \"To people entertaining such opinions as these respecting the fatal effect of contact, the narrow and crowded streets of Cairo were terrible as the easy slope that leads to Avernus.  The roaring ocean and the beetling crags owe something of their sublimity to this - that if they be tempted they can take the warm life of a man.  To the contagionist, filled as he is with the dread of final causes, having no faith in destiny, nor in the fixed will of God, and with none of the devil-may-care indifference which might stand him instead of creeds - to such one every rag that shivers in the breeze of a plague-stricken city has this sort of sublimity.  If, by any terrible ordinance, he be forced to venture forth, he sees death dangling from every sleeve, and as he creeps forward, he poises his shuddering limbs between the imminent jacket that is stabbing at his right elbow, and the murderous pelisse that threatens to mow him clean down as it sweeps along his left. \" Go ahead: remove your mask, if you dare.  Take a deep breath.  Dont be afraid.  Masked or unmasked, you never know what you'll meet on the road ahead.  \"Death,\" writes Kinglake, is \"the last and greatest of all the 'fine sights that there be. \""}}

He served as prime minister under Charles X, just before the July Revolution in 1830 that overthrew the senior line of the House of Bourbon.  It is admitted he is the one responsible for the colonisation of Algeria by France as he led the July 1830 expedition to conquer Algeria. Portrait of Jules de Polignac during the First Empire Born in Versailles, Jules was the younger son of Jules, 1st Duke of Polignac, and Gabrielle de Polastron, a confidante and favourite of Queen Marie-Antoinette.  Due to his mother's privileged position, the young Jules was raised in the environment of the court of Versailles, where his family occupied a luxurious suite of thirteen rooms.  His sister, Aglae, was married to the duc de Guiche at a young age, helping to cement the Polignac family's position as one of the leaders of high society at Versailles.  With the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789, Jules's mother and her circle were forced to flee abroad due to threats against their lives.  She had been one of the most consistent supporters of absolutism, and she bequeathed these political sympathies to her son following her death in 1793. Jules married twice.  He was married firstly, in 1816, at London to Barbara Campbell (Ardneaves House, Islay 22 Aug.  1788 - Saint-Mande 23 May 1819), a young Scotswoman, who later returned with him to France, with whom he had two children: Prince Armand (1817-1890), later 4th duc de Polignac; [ citation needed ] he has male-line descendants to date who bear the principal title.  he has male-line descendants to date who bear the principal title.  Princess Seyna-Camille (1818-1833) After his first wife's death in 1819, he married in London, on 3 June 1824, Charlotte, comtesse de Choiseul, widow of comte Cesar de Choiseul (d.  1821), nee the Honourable (Maria) Charlotte Parkyns (St.  Marylebone, 6 Jan.  1792 - 1/2 Sep.  1864).  She was the youngest child (of six children) of Thomas Parkyns, 1st Baron Rancliffe (created 1795) and his wife Elizabeth Anne James, and sister of George Augustus Anne Parkyns, Lord Rancliffe and Henrietta, Lady Rumbold (1789-1833), wife of Sir William Rumbold, 3rd Bt. He had met her while she was renewing her passport at the London embassy, where he was the Ambassador (1823-1829). They had five children, two of whom were born while their father was in prison: The couple's marriage was annulled by the French Chamber of Peers, but Jules and Charlotte went to England after his release in 1836, and they renewed their vows before the French consul in 1837. Returning to France, which was then ruled by Napoleon Bonaparte, Jules continued in his zealous loyalty to the exiled Royal Family.  In 1804, a year after his sister's death, Jules was implicated in the conspiracy of Cadoudal and Pichegru to assassinate Bonaparte, and was imprisoned until 1813.  After the restoration of the Bourbons, he was rewarded with various honours and positions.  He held various offices, received from the pope his title of \"Prince,\" in 1820, and in 1823, King Louis XVIII made him ambassador to Great Britain.  A year later, his mother's former friend ascended the throne as King Charles X.  Polignac's political sympathies did not alter, and he was one of the most conspicuous ultra-royalists during the Restoration era.  At the time, it was rumoured that Polignac supported ultra-royalist policies because he thought he was receiving inspiration from the Virgin Mary.  There is little historical evidence for this story, however.  There is no mention of such motivation in Polignac's personal memoirs or in the memoirs of the Restoration court.  On 8 August 1829, Charles X appointed him to the ministry of foreign affairs and in the following November, Polignac became president of the council, effectively the most powerful politician in France.  His appointment was considered a step towards overthrowing the constitution and Polignac, with other ministers, was held responsible for the decision to issue the Four Ordinances, which were the immediate cause of the revolution of July 1830.  Upon the outbreak of revolt, he fled, wandering for some time among the wilds of Normandy before he was arrested at Granville.  At his trial before the Chamber of Peers, he was condemned and sentenced to 'perpetual' imprisonment at the chateau in Ham.  But he benefited by the amnesty of 1836, when his sentence was commuted to exile.  During his captivity, he wrote Considerations politiques (1832).  Afterwards, he spent several years in exile in England before being permitted to re-enter France, on condition that he never again take up his abode in Paris.  According to the Legacies of British Slave-Ownership at the University College London, de Polignac was awarded a payment as a slave trader in the aftermath of the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 with the Slave Compensation Act 1837.  The British Government took out a PS15 million loan (worth PS1. 51 billion in 2022) with interest from Nathan Mayer Rothschild and Moses Montefiore which was subsequently paid off by the British taxpayers (ending in 2015).  de Polignac was associated with three different claims, he owned 628 slaves in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and received a PS15,765 payment at the time (worth PS1. 59 million in 2022). Although a French subject, de Polignac had connections in the British Empire due to his Scottish wife, Barbara Campbell (1788-1819), daughter of Duncan Campbell of Ardnave.  From his second marriage to Maria-Charlotte Parkyns, daughter of Lord Rancliffe, Jules de Polignac had fathered seven children, including Prince Ludovic de Polignac (1827-1904), a lieutenant-colonel in the French Army who participated in the colonization of Algeria; Prince Camille Armand Jules Marie de Polignac (1832-1913), a major-general in the Confederate Army during the American Civil War; and Prince Edmond de Polignac (1834-1901), a composer, musical theorist and proponent of the octatonic scale.  Jules died at St.  Germain in 1847 from the effects of his imprisonment. About one month prior, he had assumed the title of duc de Polignac upon the death of his older brother, Armand, who had died without children.  Comte Pierre de Polignac, later Prince Pierre, Duke of Valentinois (father of Rainier III of Monaco and therefore an ancestor of the entire current princely family) is descended from a different and cadet branch of the Polignac family, which has the comital rank only.  Pierre was the youngest son, descended from the youngest son of the first Duke of Polignac. Literature  W.  Schlesinger, Les femmes du XVIIIe siecle: La duchesse de Polignac et son temps (Paris, 1889) (Paris, 1889) Michael St.  John Packe, refers to Polignac as \"rascally\" in his \"Life of John Stuart Mill\".", "article_1": "Jules de Polignac, 1st Duke of Polignac (Armand Jules Francois; 7 June 1746 - 21 September 1817) was a French nobleman and the husband of Yolande de Polastron, a confidante of Queen Marie Antoinette.  He became the first Duke of Polignac in 1780.  He died at the age of seventy one in Little Russia, where he was given a manor by Catherine the Great. He was born at Claye-Souilly to Louis Heracle Armand de Polignac, Marquis of Mancini, and his wife, Diane Adelaide Zephirine Mancini, herself a granddaughter of the Duke of Nevers and the Duke of Noailles.  He bore the title of Marquis of Mancini.  He was the couple's fourth child of five, and their second son, and the brother of Diane de Polignac.  On 7 July 1767, he married Yolande Martine Gabrielle de Polastron.  His wife was later the favourite of Marie Antoinette.  As a result, he was created Duke of Polignac on 20 September 1780.  At the revolution, he fled France and died in Ukraine at the age of 71.", "article_2": "The Prince de Polignac, Confederate officer, was born at Millemont Seine-et-Oise, France, on February 16, 1832, the son of Jules de Polignac and Marie Charlotte (Parkyns).  His father had been president of the Council of Charles X of France.  Polignac studied mathematics and music at St.  Stanislas College in the 1840s.  In 1853 he joined the French army and won a second lieutenant's commission in the Crimean War.  He resigned in 1859 and traveled to Central America to study political economy and geography.  In 1861 he offered his services to the Confederacy and became a staff officer under P.  G.  T.  Beauregard and Braxton Bragg.  In January 1863 he was promoted to brigadier general and in March was transferred to the Trans-Mississippi Department to become the commander of a Texas infantry brigade.  He led the Texans in skirmishes at Vidalia and Harrisonburg, Louisiana, in the spring of 1864, and at Mansfield in the first major action of the Red River campaign.  Polignac rose to division commander that day and was soon promoted to major general, after the death of Alfred Mouton.  Polignac led the division throughout the remainder of the campaign and during its service in Arkansas in the fall of 1864.  In January 1865 he was sent to Napoleon III of France to request intervention on behalf of the Confederacy but arrived too late to accomplish anything.  After the war he again traveled to Central America, did some writing, and served as a brigadier general in the Franco-Prussian War.  In 1874 he married Marie Adolphine Longenberger, who died at the birth of their daughter.  He married Elizabeth Margaret Knight in 1883, and they had two daughters and one son.  Polignac continued to study mathematics and music until his death on November 15, 1913.  See also POLIGNAC'S BRIGADE.

She is known to be the first female architect in modern China and her husband the famed \"Father of Modern Chinese Architecture\" Liang Sicheng, both of whom worked as founders and faculty in the newly formed Architecture Department of Northeastern University in 1928 and, after 1949, as professors in Tsinghua University in Beijing.  Liang and Lin began restoration work on cultural heritage sites of China in the post-imperial Republican Era of China; a passion which she would pursue to the end of her life.  The American artist Maya Lin is her niece. Lin Huiyin as a young girl Liang Sicheng and Lin Huiin's wedding photo Lin was born in Hangzhou though her family was from Minhou.  She was the daughter of Lin Changmin (Lin Chang Min ) (16 September 1876 - Minhou, 24 December 1925) and He Xueyuan (He Xue Yuan ) (1882-1972).  In a time when women had limited access to formal education, Lin was able to receive a formal education due to being part of a wealthy family.  Because of her family's affluence she was able to travel extensively with her father.  She obtained her degrees both in England and the United States. It was there she became acquainted with the well known Chinese poet Xu Zhimo.  Their relationship was a sensational part of Lin Huiyin's life and is referred to in romantic anecdotes.  However, Lin's works are highly regarded.  Lin wrote free verse, novels and prose.  Lin's poems appeared in publications such as the Beijing Morning Post, Crescent Monthly, Poetry and the Dipper and the newspaper L'impartiale in Tianjin.  In 1924, Lin and Liang Sicheng both enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania, where she also worked as a part-time assistant in the architectural department.  Although they both wanted to attend the School of Architecture, Lin was not admitted because she was a woman.  She therefore enrolled in the School of Fine Arts. Later, she enrolled in stage design programs in Yale University as a graduate student, pursuing her longtime interest in drama. During her studies she pursued her passion for architecture by taking architectural classes. It was here that Lin along with Liang Sicheng, her future husband whom she had known since childhood, pursued their love of architecture.  In April 1924, the sixty-four-year old Indian poet Tagore visited China, Lin Huiyin and Xu Zhimo worked together to do the interpretation work for Tagore, during which Lin Huiyin distinguished herself with her fluent English and also won the admiration of the poet. In the wake of the September 18th Incident, Lin left for Beijing, where she studied ancient Chinese architecture.  Upon her return, she helped to establish the Architectural Department at Northeastern University in Shenyang, where she then taught architecture briefly. Meanwhile, in 1928, she designed a railway station in Jilin.  This was one of the few buildings Lin designed.  Throughout the 1930s, Lin and her husband lived in Beiping, as Beijing was then called, near both of their families.  Close friends at the time were the Americans Wilma and John K.  Fairbank, who admired her sense of living on a \"kind of double cultural frontier,\" and facing the problem of \"the necessity to winnow the past and discriminate among things foreign, what to preserve and what to borrow. \" He recalled the joy she took when she and her husband climbed the roof of the Temple of Heaven, which made her the first woman to attempt the walk on the emperor's palace roof and when in 1937, she discovered the main hall of Foguang Temple near Doucun, Shanxi.  The hall was the only remaining Tang dynasty timber structure known at the time. As Japan's invasion loomed, Lin Huiyin and her husband had to cut-short their promising restoration work of Beijing's cultural heritage sites in 1937 and abandoned their now famous courtyard residence in Beijing to flee southward along with personnel and materials of the Architectural Department of Northeastern University; their exodus lea them and their children to temporary settlements in the cities of Tianjin, Kunming, and finally Lizhuang in 1940. It was in Lizhuang where the bedridden Lin, still suffering from tuberculosis, was told of her younger brother's martyrdom while serving as a combat aviator in the air force in the defense of Sichuan. Lin wrote a poetic memorial: Brother, I do not have words appropriate for this era to mourn over your death.  This era made a simple request of you and you responded.  Your absolute and simple heroism is a poem of this era.  I want to add more sorrow to the unavoidable reality by screaming - you understand why - that you have gone too soon.  Brother, your bravery is great.  Your death is too cruel.  Lin Huiyin, Mourning My Third Brother Lin Heng After 1949, Lin Huiyin became a professor of architecture at Tsinghua University.  As a literary writer and architectural historian, Lin Huiyin rebuilt the capital from the aspects of cultural tradition, architectural beauty, historical significance, and living conditions of the people.  Meanwhile, Lin Huiyin participated in the design of the National emblem and the Monument to the People's Heroes. Lin designed the floral wreath patterns at the base of the Monument to the People's Heroes.  Lin also took part in the standardization of Beijing city planning.  She died in 1955 of tuberculosis. Lin Huiyin wrote poems, essays, short stories and plays.  Many of her works were praised for their subtlety, beauty, and creativity.  Some of her more well known works are: Smile, Ninety-nine Degrees, Don't Let Our Land be Lost Again! and Meizhen and Them.  Lin along with her husband wrote a book titled A Pictorial History of Chinese Architecture. During this pursuit, Lin along with her husband went to thousands of ancient Chinese architectural sites.  She conducted research and preserve China's architectural history.  They lobbied hard to protect many of the old buildings in Beijing at a time when many parts of the city were being leveled by the municipal government. She also translated English works into Chinese. Lin Huiyin is well known for her many poems and essays, she was also one of the outstanding female representatives of the May Fourth Movement.  Her essays are full of delicate feelings and are combined with the musical sense in the Chinese poetic tradition.  Her novels are full of modern content, such as the most famous \"You Are the April of This World\".  Similarly, Lin Huiyin and other writers also participated in the May Fourth Movement.  Unfortunately, \"gender\" has a great irony for the national cultural revival of the May Fourth Movement.  Under the hegemony of antitraditionalism, it made the environment for female writers tougher.  Nevertheless, Lin Huiyin skillfully integrated the aesthetics of Tang poetry into the language and syntax of modernism and used the traditional literary practice of episodic narration to combat the gender determinants of these idioms.  Lin Huiyin was fond of free love and ideal, but the free love under May Fourth turned into the tragic idealism in the social background, which exacerbated the pain of gender oppression. Tagore with Lin Huiyin in Beijing in May 1924 In addition to architectural research, Lin Huiyin also engaged in literary creation.  As a young girl, Lin Huiyin went abroad with her father to study in Europe.  In England, Lin met Xu Zhimo in England, who guided her to the road of literature.  Therefore, Lin Huiyin set her foot on the road of literature.  Xu Zhimo encouraged Lin Huiyin to write literature, especially poetry.  Later, they organized activities, performed dramas, and experimented with more literary forms together. When Rabindranath Tagore came to China, Lin and Xu worked together as translators, contacting the great poets of the world and learning poems from Tagore. She was more famous because she became the leading lady in Tagore's drama Chitra. Lin Huiyin has a strong understanding of literature, therefore, her poems are rich in themes.  During the transient years, in the quiet contemplation at night, Lin Huiyin has been used to expressing her feelings in poetry.  Her poems often reveal the subtlety of human love, the silent beauty of nature, and the fortitude of life. Liang Sicheng and Lin Huiyin in the Temple of Heaven In October, 2010, as part of a revival of Lin Huiyin and her husband's life accomplishments, CCTV broadcast a six-hour, eight-episode documentary on the husband and wife. The documentary is titled Liang Sicheng Lin Huiyin and was directed by Hu Jingcao.  Although Lin did not receive the recognition during her lifetime considering her gender, there is now a renewed revival of her legacy.  It has been quoted of Lin Huiyin that \"it is often only through the light given off by a man that we see the woman behind him, particularly so for young women in the arts who emerged from the republican era.  But Lin Huiyin is an exception.  In her, we see the reflection of many outstanding men of the time, but in fact it is she who adds extra color and shine to their images. \" In 2018, the New York Times wrote a belated obituary for Lin Huiyin and her husband.", "article_1": "Liang Sicheng and Lin Huiyin came to Penn at the height of Philadelphias Beaux-Arts building boom.  They returned to revolutionary China with ideas that made a lasting mark on the development of architecture in the Peoples Republic.  By Naomi Elegant In 1947, when he was a visiting fellow at Yale University and Chinas representative on the international team designing the United Nations Headquarters in New York, Liang Sicheng Ar27 GAr27 took a short trip to Philadelphia to visit his alma mater.  He stayed at the Camac Street residence of Alfred Bendiner Ar22 GAr27, an architecture classmate from Penn whose wife Elizabeth was close friends with Liangs wife and longtime collaborator, Lin Huiyin FA27.  Bendiner asked Liang if he wanted to give a talk at the Architects Alumni Association dinner they were attending, which had been arranged to accommodate Liangs busy schedule.  \"You can see what a hot shot you have gotten to be,\" Bendiner teased his old classmate in a letter.  Liang politely declined the speaking invitation, explaining in a handwritten reply that \"it would be best for me to join my old friends, have lots of fun, and no talk. \" Liang stayed overnight and left Philadelphia the next evening, after spending the day \"in the Museum,\" likely the Penn Museum.  Bendiner had been trying to get the University to award Liang an honorary degree, but missed the deadline and had been advised to re-apply the following year, provided Liang was still in the United States.  By that time, though, he had returned to China for good.  Liang Sicheng and Lin Huiyin were part of a group of Chinese students who came to the US on Boxer Indemnity scholarships in the 1920s and then returned to China, becoming known as the First Generation in Chinese architecture.  \"Every architect in China traces his or her lineage from this group,\" says Nancy Steinhardt, professor of East Asian art and curator of Chinese art at the Penn Museum.  \"They took the Penn education, they went back to China, and they wanted to make a difference in the future of their nation. \" When Liang and Lin arrived at Penn in September 1924, Philadelphia was the third-largest city in the country.  It was a vital sea port and industrial powerhouse.  Architecturally, it was emerging from the City Beautiful Movement and into the golden age of the pre-Crash 1920s.  Everywhere, buildings were cropping up that reflected the citys vibrancy and growth: in 1927, the Parkway Central Library opened its doors; in 1928, the Philadelphia Museum of Art; and in 1929, the Rodin Museum, designed by the French Beaux-Arts master Paul Philippe Cret, who taught and influenced Liang Sicheng, Lin Huiyin, and other members of the First Generation, as well as Louis Kahn Ar24 Hon71, who graduated from Penn the year Liang and Lin matriculated.  Cret came to Penn in 1903, recruited by Fine Arts dean Warren Powers Laird to lead the architectural program, and stayed on the faculty until he retired in 1937.  By the 1920s, when Liang, Lin, and many other Boxer scholars were on campus, the program had flowered into one of the best in the country, specializing in the Beaux-Arts style Cret had imported from Paris.  In 1926 the School of Fine Arts announced that Penn students had won more architecture competitions in the previous four years than students from all other schools combined; half of the winners were Chinese students.  The overlap between Cret and the students who became part of the First Generation was serendipitous.  There is a certain visual compatibility between the Beaux-Arts style and traditional Chinese architecture, Steinhardt explains.  In both disciplines, \"Theres a grand formalism, theres symmetry, theres the use of gates, and theres also a link with antiquity. \" Rodin Museum (Philadelphia) and Hall of Supreme Harmony (Beijing) share design characteristics.  Just place a photograph of the Forbidden Citys Hall of Supreme Harmony in Beijing next to a photograph of a Beaux-Arts building, Steinhardt suggests, and in both \"there is this grandeur, symmetry, clear central axis, and emphasis on the sides and the top. \" Liangs Beaux-Arts education lent itself to his preservation efforts back in China, offering \"a gentler way to modernize. \" It was not just the sublime that he picked up through his architectural education at Penn, but the mundane, too.  He took classes in heating and plumbing, which traditional Chinese buildings--like those in the Forbidden City, constructed from impermanent materials like wood--had never incorporated.  \"Liangs personal mission was for China to be able to modernize without losing Old China,\" Steinhardt says.  \"So what he was trying to do is use modern materials, but always make China look like China.  He really worked hard not to lose the past. \" Philadelphia is dotted with Paul Crets influence [\"Arts,\" Sep|Oct 2018].  In addition to the Rodin Museum, he drafted the first plans for the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, based on the Champs-Elysees in Paris, and he designed the original Barnes Foundation building in Merion, all in the Beaux-Arts style.  Steinhardt says that there is no evidence that Liang and the other First Generation architects came to Penn specifically to study under Cret.  \"Its kind of just really good fortune that this was the person Liang worked with. \" Though Liang and Lin both came to Penn to study architecture, only Liang graduated with degrees in it (earning both a masters and a bachelors in architecture in three years).  The architecture program did not admit women--it only changed that policy in the mid-1930s--so Lin graduated with a bachelor of fine arts degree.  At the time, only 10 percent of students in the School of Fine Arts--which encompassed the architecture, music, and fine arts programs--were women, and the majority studied music.  According to Wilma Fairbank, Lins close friend and author of a seminal biography of the couple, women couldnt enter the program because \"architectural students had to work on their drafting at all hours of the night, and the unchaperoned presence of women would be improper. \" Lin had not acquiesced without a fight: when she was still in Beijing, she and her father wrote letters to Laird, asking if she could circumvent the policy, even enlisting the Chinese Legation Minister--equivalent to the national ambassador--to speak to the dean on her behalf.  Laird was unrelenting, advising Lin to apply to other schools or to consider working toward a fine arts degree and supplementing it with architecture electives.  Lin opted to enroll at Penn despite those limitations, but her academic record shows that architecture was always front and center.  She worked in Crets office, took graduate-level design courses and some courses that ordinarily excluded women (carpentry, plumbing, and drainage), and from 1926 to 1927 even served as a part-time architecture instructor.  With the help of a summer session, she still managed to graduate a year early.  Laird, who had been so resistant to admitting Lin to the architecture program, later wrote, \"Miss Lin has pursued her course of study with great earnestness and a high degree of success.  The amount of study which she has taken each year has been greater than that of the average student . . .  In point of character, breeding, mentality and natural talent Miss Lin has shown the highest qualities. \" Classmates recall Lin Huiyin, who went by Phyllis in English-speaking circles, as vivacious and social.  Her friend and fellow student Elizabeth Sutro FA27, who later married Bendiner, told Penn archivist Francis Dallett in 1979 that Lin was \"an exquisite, lovely girl\" with a \"wonderful sense of humor. \" The author of a 1925 article in the The Philadelphia Public Ledger seemed as spellbound by Lin as everyone else who met her, writing of her \"soft laughter\" and \"sharp, black eyes twinkling with amusement. \" In Chinese popular culture today, the couple has been elevated to near-mythical romantic status.  They have been the subject of multi-part documentaries, television soap operas, and even an actual opera--the China National Opera and Drama Theatres Lin Huiyin, which premiered in May 2017 in Beijing.  Lins personal life especially has been the subject of public sensation.  Before heading to Penn and marrying Liang, she became acquainted with the Chinese poet Xu Zhimo while studying in England.  Xu fell in love with the young Lin and divorced his first wife, Zhang Youyi, whose great niece went on to write a book about Zhangs life and that tumultuous love triangle.  In addition to architecture, Lin was also a published writer of poems and prose.  She traveled Europe with her father, the politician and diplomat Lin Changmin.  When Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore visited China, it was Lins family who hosted the giant of Bengali literature, and Lin and Xu who interpreted for him.  Lins ability to travel and her access to education was an anomaly for women at that time.  She enjoyed these privileges thanks to a wealthy family and supportive father, explains Siyen Fei, associate professor of Chinese history at Penn.  \"Not everybody enjoyed that level of freedom.  Social class was a big factor. \" Still, Lins lifetime of accomplishments was exceptional.  \"She really became, I think, a role model in China for women,\" Fei says.  \"She was very active, shes beautiful, talented, and she still asserted that kind of independence--she had a career [and] a husband who really respected what she did. \" As widespread as Lins influence may have been, her legacy is most tangible on a much smaller scale--within her family.  Her niece is the American architect Maya Lin, whose illustrious career was kickstarted in 1981 when, at 21 and still an undergraduate at Yale, she won a nationwide competition to design the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, DC.  \"My whole life was framed by my fathers respect for Lin Huiyin,\" Maya Lin said to Smithsonian magazine in 2017.  \"You could say that Lins passion for art and architecture flows through me[. ] Now Im doing what she wanted to do. \" Liang and Lin, not yet married, lived separately while at Penn.  When he first arrived, Liang lived on 40th Street, in a Victorian a few houses down from what is now Copabanana, where todays Penn students congregate for happy hour margaritas.  Lin boarded in a Spruce Street dwelling that now houses the independent bookstore House Of Our Own.  Liang later moved to Pine Street, and then into a building on 38th Street which no longer exists; Lin moved to another boarding house, on Woodland Avenue, a block east of what became her favorite place in Philadelphia.  \"Woodland Cemetery is the spot I like best in this whole city of Philadelphia,\" Lin told The Philadelphia Public Ledger.  \"Its only the hustle, bustle and noise that never ends that makes me so tired.  I like quiet, I like to get alone sometimes . . .  If I go to Fairmount Park, yes, I see trees and grass, but the crowds are always there.  I guess I must sit among the tombs. \" Her attraction to that bucolic burial ground, with its winding paths and immense trees, would later find an echo in her nieces experience of New Haven.  Maya Lin, in a 1982 Washington Post article, described visits to the cemetery near Yales campus as one of her favorite activities as an undergraduate architecture student there.  \"The Grove Street Cemetery is beautiful,\" she said at the time.  \"Theres something peaceful about it.  You feel removed.  You feel youre in their world.  Youre in the world of the dead. \" Though she stole away to the cemetery for peace and solitude, Lin Huiyin was remarkably active in collegiate extracurricular life.  She was a member of the Chinese Student Association, the May Day Lighting Committee, and the Social Committee of the Philadelphia Chinese Students Club.  In 1926 she won a Christmas card design competition, and in 1927 she invited prominent Chinese intellectual Hu Shih to speak in Philadelphia.  For Liang, Lin, and the other First Generation architects, Penn was always a stepping stone to a greater, lifelong commitment.  \"They were the kind of people who did not plan to stay in the West at all.  They really identified with China and they were here to learn things to bring back to China,\" Fei says.  When they returned to China, the First Generation set up the first architecture schools and design firms in the country.  Nineteen-year-old Lin, speaking to the Ledger correspondent, explained how she intended to use her Western education: \"We must learn the fundamental principles of all art only in order to apply them to designs distinctly ours.  We want to study methods of construction that mean permanency. \" Liang and Lin married in 1928 and spent the rest of their shared life collaborating on articles, teaching, traveling, and designing buildings together.  They spent much of the 1930s traversing Chinas vast and remote countryside, seeking and surveying centuries-old wooden temples tucked into mountainside terraces, often braving mud, lice, and bandits to do so.  Their measurements, sketches, and photographs are in some cases the only such recordings of the beautiful and dilapidated structures they found, many of which were destroyed by Japanese bombings during World War II, or amidst the chaos of the Cultural Revolution.  According to Dallett, the archivist, they sent two or three volumes of their drawings of temple woodwork back to Philadelphia as a gift for their mentor Paul Cret.  When the Peoples Liberation Army was on the brink of taking over Beijing during Chinas civil war, its leaders asked Liang and Lin to help mark out any buildings of cultural value, so that they knew what to protect if fighting extended into the city.  After the establishment of the Peoples Republic in 1949, Liang and Lin stayed in China to work with the new government and help shape the future of their country.  Liang also hoped that a socialist government would bring urban planning and preservation under centralized control.  Liangs drawing of an old Chinese structure.  Monument to the Peoples Heroes.  The couple designed the Monument to the Peoples Heroes, an obelisk that stands today in Tiananmen Square in Beijing, though Lin did not live to see it completed.  She died of tuberculosis in 1955, three years before construction finished on the obelisk and a decade before the start of the Cultural Revolution, under which Liang was deemed a counterrevolutionary and sent to the countryside for re-education.  Liangs second wife, Lin Zhu, hid his notes and drawings to avoid the risk of confiscation; those papers later formed his posthumous magnum opus, A Pictorial History of Chinese Architecture, which contains some of the only recordings of the structures he and Lin painstakingly chronicled in the 1930s.  Liang died in Beijing in 1972.  Its hard, in retrospect, not to look at their story and see a tragedy, a narrative of lost potential.  In 1949, Liang drafted an urban development plan for Beijing, outlining a proposal to preserve and commemorate its magnificent castellated city walls, ancient gates, watchtowers and hutong--the architecture that had prompted American city planner Edmund Bacon (sometimes referred to as \"The Father of Modern Philadelphia\") to dub Beijing, in the 1930s, \"possibly the greatest single work of man on the face of the earth. \" Liangs plan envisioned a total transformation of Beijing that combined the preservation of the old with the construction of the new.  \"He came back literally to build a new China.  That was his mission, that was his mandate,\" Steinhardt says.  According to his plans, the old city was to become a public park, and adjacent satellite towns and industrial zones could be constructed in its outskirts.  But Mao Zedong rejected Liangs proposal, famously pledging to remake the metropolis into \"a forest of smokestacks. \" \"Its a really human story,\" Steinhardt says.  \"Its not that much of an exaggeration to say he gave his life to try to save the city of Beijing, and he wasnt successful. \" But Liangs impact on modern Chinese architecture--in tandem with Lin, his lifelong collaborator until her death--remains unparalleled.  While other First Generation members went on to become \"pure architects,\" Steinhardt sees Liangs influence manifested in numerous roles: architect, educator, academic, historic preservationist, and pioneer in field work and restoration.  Even now, Steinhardt says, Penns campus is a site of near pilgrimage.  Chinese architects will come and ask to see where Liang took classes and sketched buildings, and students remain in awe of their predecessor.  For \"architecture students who come here,\" she says, \"this is where Liang studied. \" Liang and Lin were born to well-off families who represented the intellectual, cultural, and social elite of China.  After 1949, when many of the same background chose to leave, Fei says, \"They decided to stay because of their sense of mission to change things in China and to do something for Chinese people.  So they also belong to these very progressive, left-wing, young scholars in China.  Theres still a lot to be said about that kind of idealism. \" Every spring, Fei teaches a survey course on modern China for Penn undergraduates, the majority of whom have never heard of the famous couple.  When she gets to the lectures on Liang and Lin, she says, \"I can see students eyes kind of light up.  They really are excited to see this aspect of Penn. \" For Chinese international students, the connection can be even more significant.  \"I think we sort of see the increasing presence of international students as a very recent phenomenon,\" Fei says.  \"For Chinese students, I think for a lot of them its very meaningful when they [see] we actually have got this long connection between China and Penn. \" When Alfred Bendiner was applying for an honorary degree from Penn on behalf of his friend Liang, he sent over a three-page copy of the architects CV for Liang to check over before mailing it to the Penn administration.  Liang returned the copy with his corrections in black ink: an honorary degree from Princeton in 1947, the Chinese titles of monographs from the 1930s, a couple of typos.  Under the heading \"Creative Work in Architecture\"--a listing of the buildings hed designed--Liang had amended every entry, from \"The Geology Building, National Peking University\" to \"a number of residences and shops, etc. ,\" in his neat, cramped handwriting, so that they read: & Phyllis Lin; (Lin Hui-yin) in collaboration with Phyllis Lin with Phyllis Lin.

It was here that Lin along with Liang Sicheng, her future husband whom she had known since childhood, pursued their love of architecture.  In April 1924, the sixty-four-year old Indian poet Tagore visited China, Lin Huiyin and Xu Zhimo worked together to do the interpretation work for Tagore, during which Lin Huiyin distinguished herself with her fluent English and also won the admiration of the poet.  In the wake of the September 18th Incident, Lin left for Beijing, where she studied ancient Chinese architecture.  Upon her return, she helped to establish the Architectural Department in Northeastern University in Shenyang, where she then taught architecture briefly.  Meanwhile, in 1928, she designed a railway station in Jilin.  This was one of the few buildings Lin designed.  Throughout the 1930s, Lin and her husband lived in Beiping, as Beijing was then called, near both of their families.  Close friends at the time were the Americans Wilma and John K.  Fairbank, who admired her sense of living on a \"kind of double cultural frontier,\" and facing the problem of \"the necessity to winnow the past and discriminate among things foreign, what to preserve and what to borrow. \" In 1936, in order to develop measurement records of the Chinese ancient architecture, Lin Huiyin and her husband climbed the roof of the Temple of Heaven; she became the first woman to attempt the walk on the emperor's palace roof.  In 1937, she discovered the main hall of Foguang Temple near Doucun, Shanxi.  The hall was the only remaining Tang dynasty timber structure known at the time.  As Japan's invasion loomed, Lin Huiyin and her husband had to cut-short their promising restoration work of Beijing's cultural heritage sites in 1937 and abandoned their now famous courtyard residence in Beijing to flee southward along with personnel and materials of the Architectural Department of Northeastern University; their exodus lead them and their children to temporary settlements in the cities of Tianjin, Kunming, and finally Lizhuang in 1940.  After 1949, Lin Huiyin became professor of architecture at Tsinghua University.  Lin was involved in the design of the Chinese national flag, the National Emblem of the People's Republic of China and the Monument to the People's Heroes located in the Tiananmen Square.  Lin designed the floral wreath patterns at the base of the Monument to the People's Heroes.  Lin also took part in the standardization of Beijing city planning.

Overlooked tells the stories of women and others, many of them marginalized, who left indelible marks on society but whose deaths were not reported by The Times.  Many of Chinas ancient architectural treasures crumbled to dust before Lin Huiyin and Liang Sicheng began documenting them in the 1930s.  In China, ancient structures were usually treated like any other buildings rather than protected and studied, as they were in many Western countries.  The husband and wife team were among the first preservationists to operate in China, and by far the best known.  Their efforts have since inspired generations of people to speak out for architecture threatened by the rush toward development.  Becoming Chinas premier architectural historians was no easy feat.  The buildings they wanted to save were centuries old, often in a shambles and situated in remote parts of the country.  In many cases they had to journey in treacherous conditions across the Chinese countryside to reach them.  Exploring Chinas outlying areas during the 1930s meant traveling muddy roads by mule, rickshaw or on foot.  This was a demanding undertaking for both Liang, who walked with a bad limp after a motorcycle accident as a young man, and Lin, who endured tuberculosis for years.  Inns were often squalid and food could be tainted, and there was always a risk of violence by rebels, soldiers and bandits.  Their greatest discovery came on an expedition in 1937, when they dated and meticulously cataloged Foguang Si, or the Temple of Buddhas Light, in Wutai County, Shanxi Province.  This breathtaking wooden temple was built in 857 A. D. , making it the oldest known building in China at the time.  (It is now the fourth-oldest known). ", "article_4": "A number of books have been published recently which reexamine the fascinating life and work of groundbreaking architectural historian and 'Lady of Letters', Lin Huiyin.  Lin Huiyin, (1904-1955), an outstanding female poet and architectural historian from the first half of the 20th century in China, was an erudite generalist who wrote about literature, arts, architecture and philosophy.  The favorite daughter of Mr.  Lin Changmin, a high-rank governor in the Beiyang Government, 16-year-old Lin Huiyin traveled with her father around Europe and the United States in the 1920s.  In 1928, Lin got married in Canada to Mr.  Liang Sicheng, son of China's famous politician and scholar, Liang Qichao.  The couple had met while studying at Pennsylvania University in America.  On returning to China, Lin Huiyin started teaching architecture at Northeast University and then moved to Beijing's Qinghua University.  She co-wrote the famous \"Development Stages of Chinese Architecture\" with her husband Liang Sicheng and another architect.  She also contributed to the design for China's National Emblem and the Hero of the People's Monument in Beijing's Tiananmen Square.  Accompanying her husband to thousands of ancient Chinese architectural sites, most of which were in remote areas, she worked tirelessly to research China's architectural history.  She and her husband lobbied hard to protect many of the old buildings in Beijing at a time when the municipal government was leveling many parts of the city for new construction.  Lin and her husband Liang Sicheng One of Li Huiyin's paintings Lin Huiyin's interests were very extensive and in addition to her work on architecture, she also wrote poems, essays, short stories and plays as well as translating works from English.  She was well known in literary circles as hostess of one of the country's most famous literary salons in her home in Beijing's Zhongbu Hutong.  One of the more sensational parts of Lin Huiyin's life was her affair with romantic poet Xu Zhimo and she remains best known nowadays as an extremely beautiful female poet of the 1930s.  As a symbol of independent women of the time, Lin Huiyin and her western education and fluent English gave her a broader outlook on life than most women of the time.  Despite suffering from phthisis towards the end of her life, she never abandoned her work.  One famous writer recalled once visited to the ailing Lin, \"She looked anything but a sick person and was wearing a horse riding dress.  She still talked so quickly that you couldn't get a word in.  She never talked indirectly, or vaguely, but always straight to the point.  Her criticisms never offended others and I was always amazed by her extraordinary understanding of the arts. \" (CRI June 18, 2004)", "article_5": "Architectural preservation is rarely so thrilling as it was in 1930s China.  As the country teetered on the edge of war and revolution, a handful of obsessive scholars were making adventurous expeditions into the countrys vast rural hinterland, searching for the forgotten treasures of ancient Chinese architecture.  At the time, there were no official records of historic structures that survived in the provinces.  The semi-feudal countryside had become a dangerous and unpredictable place: Travelers venturing only a few miles from major cities had to brave muddy roads, lice-infested inns, dubious food and the risk of meeting bandits, rebels and warlord armies.  But although these intellectuals traveled by mule cart, rickshaw or even on foot, their rewards were great.  Within the remotest valleys of China lay exquisitely carved temples staffed by shaven-headed monks much as they had been for centuries, their roofs filled with bats, their candlelit corridors lined with dust-covered masterpieces.  The two leaders of this small but dedicated group have taken on a mythic status in China today: the architect Liang Sicheng and his brilliant poet wife, Lin Huiyin.  This prodigiously talented couple, who are now revered in much the same way as Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo in Mexico, were part of a new generation of Western-educated thinkers who came of age in the 1920s.  Born into aristocratic, progressive families, they had both studied at the University of Pennsylvania and other Ivy League schools in the United States, and had traveled widely in Europe.  Overseas, they were made immediately aware of the dearth of studies on Chinas rich architectural tradition.  So on their return to Beijing, the cosmopolitan pair became pioneers of the discipline, espousing the Western idea that historic structures are best studied by firsthand observation on field trips.  This was a radical idea in China, where scholars had always researched the past through manuscripts in the safety of their libraries, or at most, made unsystematic studies of the imperial palaces in Beijing.  But with flamboyant bravado, Liang and Lin--along with a half dozen or so other young scholars in the grandly named Institute for Research in Chinese Architecture--used the only information available, following stray leads in ancient texts, chasing up rumors and clues found in cave murals, even, in one case, an old folkloric song.  It was, Liang later wrote, \"like a blind man riding a blind horse. \" Despite the difficulties, the couple would go on to make a string of extraordinary discoveries in the 1930s, documenting almost 2,000 exquisitely carved temples, pagodas and monasteries that were on the verge of being lost forever.  Photographs show the pair scrambling among stone Buddhas and across tiled roofs, Liang Sicheng the gaunt, bespectacled and reserved aesthete, scion of an illustrious family of political reformers (on par with being a Roosevelt or Kennedy in the U. S. ), Lin Huiyin the more extroverted and effervescent artist, often wearing daring white sailor slacks in the Western fashion.  The beautiful Lin was already legendary for the romantic passions she had inspired, leaving a trail of lovelorn writers and philosophers, including the renowned Indian poet Rabindranath Tagore, who once composed a poem in praise of her charms.  (\"The blue of the sky / fell in love with the green of the earth.  / The breeze between them sighs, 'Alas!\") \"Liang and Lin founded the entire field of Chinese historical architecture,\" says Nancy Steinhardt, professor of East Asian art at the University of Pennsylvania.  \"They were the first to actually go out and find these ancient structures.  But the importance of their field trips goes beyond that: So many of the temples were later lost--during the war with Japan, the revolutionary civil war and the Communist attacks on tradition like the Cultural Revolution--that their photos and studies are now invaluable documents. \" The romantic pair, whose letters are suffused with a love of poetry and literature, returned most often to the province of Shanxi (\"west of the mountains\").  Its untouched landscape was the ultimate time capsule from imperial China.  An arid plateau 350 miles from Beijing, cut off by mountains, rivers and deserts, Shanxi had avoided Chinas most destructive wars for over 1,000 years.  There had been spells of fabulous prosperity as late at the 19th century, when its merchants and bankers managed the financial life of the last dynasty, the Qing.  But by the 1930s, it had drifted into impoverished oblivion--and poverty, as the axiom goes, is the preservationists friend.  Shanxi, it was found, resembled a living museum, where an astonishing number of ancient structures had survived.  One of the most significant excursions to Shanxi occurred in 1934, when Liang and Lin were joined by two young American friends, John King Fairbank and his wife, Wilma.  The couples had met through friends, and the Fairbanks became regular guests at the salons hosted by Liang and Lin for Chinese philosophers, artists and writers.  It was an influential friendship: John, a lanky, sandy-haired South Dakotan, would go on to become the founding figure in Sinology in the United States, and an adviser to the U. S.  government on Chinese policy from World War II to the 1970s.  (The prestigious Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies at Harvard University bears his name. ) Wilma was a fine arts major from Radcliffe, a feisty New Englander in the mold of Katharine Hepburn, who would later become an authority on Chinese art in her own right, and play a key role in saving Liang and Lins work from oblivion.  But in the summer of 1934, the Fairbanks were two wide-eyed newlyweds in Beijing, where John was researching his PhD in Chinese history, and they eagerly agreed to meet the Liangs in Shanxi.  The four spent several weeks making forays from an idyllic mountain retreat called Fenyang, before they decided to find the remote temple of Guangsheng.  Today, the details of this 1934 journey can be reconstructed from an intimate photographic diary made by Wilma Fairbank and from her memoir.  The prospect of the 70 miles of travel had at first seemed \"trivial,\" Wilma noted, but it became a weeklong expedition.  Summer rains had turned the road to \"gumbo,\" so the antique Model T Ford they had hired gave out after ten miles.  They transferred their luggage to mule carts, but were soon forced by the soldiers of the local warlord Yan Shinxan, who were building a railroad line along the only roads, to take the back trails, which were traversable only by rickshaw.  (John was particularly uncomfortable being pulled by human beings, and sympathized when the surly drivers complained, \"We have been doing ox and horse work. \") When the tracks became \"bottomless jelly,\" the four were forced to walk, led after dark by a child carrying a lantern.  Liang Sicheng battled on through the mire, despite his near-lame leg, the result of a youthful motorbike accident.  The inns en route were dismal, so they looked for alternative arrangements, sleeping one night in an empty Ming dynasty mansion, others in the homes of lonely missionaries.  All along the route they were surrounded by peasants who stared in wonder at Liang and Lin, unable to conceive of Chinese gentry taking an interest in their rural world.  Often, the histrionic Lin Huiyin would fall into \"black moods\" and complain vociferously about every setback, which astonished the stiff-upper-lipped, WASPish Wilma Fairbank.  But while the diva poet could be \"unbearable,\" Wilma conceded, \"when she was rested she responded to beautiful views and humorous encounters with utter delight. \" The discomforts were instantly forgotten when the exhausted party finally spotted the graceful proportions of the Guangsheng Temple one dusk.  The monks allowed the Fairbanks to sleep in the moonlit courtyard, while the Liangs set up their cots beneath ancient statues.  Next morning, the Liangs marveled at the temples inventive structural flourishes created by a nameless ancient architect, and found a fascinating mural of a theatrical performance from A. D.  1326.  They climbed a steep hill to the Upper Temple, where a pagoda was encrusted in colored glazed tiles.  Behind the enormous Buddhas head was a secret staircase, and when they reached the 13th story, they were rewarded with sweeping views of the countryside, as serene as a Ming watercolor.  The years of field trips would ultimately represent an interlude of dreamlike contentment for Liang and Lin, as their lives were caught in the wheels of Chinese history.  All explorations in northern China were halted by the Japanese invasion in 1937, which forced the couple to flee Beijing with their two young children to ever-harsher and more distant refuges.  (The Fairbanks had left one year earlier, but John returned as a U. S.  intelligence officer during World War II and Wilma soon after. ) There was a moment of hope after the Japanese surrender, when Liang and Lin were welcomed back to Beijing as leading intellectuals, and Liang, as \"the father of modern Chinese architecture,\" returned to the United States to teach at Yale in 1946 and work with Le Corbusier on the design of the United Nations Plaza in New York.  But then came the Communist triumph in 1949.  Liang and Lin initially supported the revolution, but soon found themselves out of step with Mao Zedongs desire to eradicate Chinas \"feudal\" heritage.  Most famously, the pair argued passionately for the preservation of Beijing, then the worlds largest and most intact walled city, considered by many as beautiful as Paris.  Tragically, Mao ordered its 25 miles of fortress walls and many of its monuments destroyed--which one U. S.  scholar has denounced as \"among the greatest acts of urban vandalism in history. \" The rest of their lives have a tragic aura.  Lin Huiyin, who had always been frail, succumbed to a long battle with tuberculosis in 1955, and Liang, despite his international renown, was trapped in 1966 by the anti-intellectual mania of the Cultural Revolution.  The frenzied attack on Chinese tradition meant that Liang was forced to wear a black placard around his neck declaring him a \"reactionary academic authority. \" Beaten and mocked by Red Guards, stripped of his honors and his position, Liang died brokenhearted in a one-room garret in 1972, convinced that he and his wifes lifes work had been wasted.  Miraculously, he was wrong, thanks to the dramatic volte-face of Chinas modern history.  After the death of Mao in 1976, Liang Sicheng was among the first wave of persecuted intellectuals to be rehabilitated.  Lin Huiyins poetry was republished to widespread acclaim, and Liangs portrait even appeared on a postage stamp in 1992.  In the 1980s, Fairbank managed to track down the pairs drawings and photographs from the 1930s, and reunite them with a manuscript Liang had been working on during World War II.  The posthumous volume, An Illustrated History of Chinese Architecture, became an enduring testament to the couples work.  Today, the younger generations of Chinese are fascinated by these visionary figures, whose dramatic lives have turned them into \"cultural icons, almost with demigod status,\" says Steinhardt of the University of Pennsylvania.  The dashing pair have been the subjects of TV documentaries, and Lin Huiyins love life has been pored over in biographies and soap operas.  She is regularly voted the most beautiful woman in Chinese history and will be played in an upcoming feature film by the sultry actress Zhang Ziyi, of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon fame.  \"For Chinese women, Lin Huiyin seems to have it all,\" says Annie Zhou, Lins great-granddaughter, who was raised in the United States.  \"Shes smart, beautiful and independent.  But theres also a nostalgia for her world in the 1920s and 30s, which was the intellectual peak of modern Chinese history. \" \"Since when did historical preservationists get to be so sexy?\" muses Maya Lin, the famous American artist and architect, who happens to be Lin Huiyins niece.  Talking in her loft-studio in downtown Manhattan, Maya pointed through enormous windows at the cast-iron district of SoHo, which was saved by activists in New York in the 1960s and 70s.  \"Theyve become folk heroes in China for having stood up for preservation, like Jane Jacobs here in New York, and they are celebrities in certain academic circles in the United States. \" She recalls being cornered by elderly (male) professors at Yale who raved about meeting her aunt, their eyes lighting up when they spoke of her.  \"Most people in China know more about Liang and Lins personalities and love lives than their work.  But from an architectural point of view, they are hugely important.  If it werent for them, we would have no record of so many ancient Chinese styles, which simply disappeared. \" Since Chinas embrace of capitalism in the 1980s, a growing number of Chinese are realizing the wisdom of Liang and Lins preservation message.  As Beijings wretched pollution and traffic gridlock have reached world headlines, Liangs 1950 plan to save the historic city has taken on a prophetic value.  \"I realize now how terrible it is for a person to be so far ahead of his time,\" says Hu Jingcao, the Beijing filmmaker who directed the documentary Liang and Lin in 2010.  \"Liang saw things 50 years before everyone else.  Now we say, Lets plan our cities, lets keep them beautiful! Lets make them work for people, not just cars.  But for him, the idea only led to frustration and suffering. \" The situation is more encouraging in Liang and Lins favorite destination, Shanxi.  The isolated province still contains around 70 percent of Chinas structures older than the 14th century--and the couples magnum opus on Chinese architecture can be used as a unique guidebook.  I had heard that the most evocative temples survive there, although they take some effort to reach.  The backwaters of Shanxi remain rustic, their inhabitants unused to foreigners, and getting around is still an adventure, even if run-ins with warlords have been phased out.  A renewed search for the temples would provide a rare view back to the 1930s, when China was poised on the knife-edge of history, before its slide into cataclysmic wars and Maoist self-destruction.  Of course, historic quests in modern China require some planning.  Its one of the ironies of history that the province containing the greatest concentration of antiquities has also become one of the most polluted spots on the planet.  Since the 1980s, coal-rich Shanxi has sold its black soul to mining, its hills pockmarked with smelters churning out electricity for the countrys insatiable factories.  Of the worlds most polluted cities, 16 of the top 20 are in China, according to a recent study by the World Bank.  Three of the worst are in Shanxi.  I had to wonder where Liang and Lin would choose as a base today.  As the plane approached Taiyuan, the provincial capital, and dove beneath rust-colored layers of murk, the air in the cabin suddenly filled with the smell of burning rubber.  This once-picturesque outpost, where Liang and Lin clambered among the temple eaves, has become one of Chinas many anonymous \"second-tier\" cities, rung by shabby skyscrapers.  Other Shanxi favorites have suffered in the development craze.  In the grottoes of Yungang, whose caves full of giant carved Buddhas were silent and eerie when Lin sketched them in 1931, riotous tour groups are now funneled through an enormous new imperial-style entrance, across artificial lakes and into faux palaces, creating a carnival atmosphere.  But luckily, there is still a place where Liang and Lin would feel happy --Pingyao, Chinas last intact walled town, and one of its most evocative historic sites.  When the pair was traveling in the 1930s, dozens and dozens of these impressive fortress towns were scattered across the Shanxi plains.  In fact, according to the imperial encyclopedia of the 14th century, there were 4,478 walled towns in China at one time.  But one by one their defenses were knocked down after the revolution as symbols of the feudal past.  Pingyao survived only because authorities in the poor district lacked the resources to topple its formidable fortifications, which are up to 39 feet thick, 33 feet high and topped with 72 watchtowers.  The crenelated bastions, dating from 1370, also enclosed a thriving ancient town, its lane ways lined with lavish mansions, temples and banks dating from the 18th century, when Pingyao was the Qing dynastys financial capital.  A dusty highway now leads to Pingyaos enormous fortress gates, but once inside, all vehicular traffic is forced to stop.  It is an instant step back to the elusive dream of Old China.  On my own visit, arriving at night, I was at first disconcerted by the lack of street lighting.  In the near-darkness, I edged along narrow cobbled alleys, past noodle shops where the cooks were bent over bubbling caldrons.  Street vendors roasted kebabs on charcoal grills.  Soon my eyes adjusted to the dark, and I spotted rows of lanterns illuminating ornate facades with gold calligraphy, all historic establishments dating from the 16th to 18th centuries, including exotic spice merchants and martial arts agencies that had once provided protection for banks.  One half-expects silk-robed kung fu warriors to appear, tripping lightly across the terra-cotta tile roofs a la Ang Lee.  Liang and Lins spirits hover over the remote town today.  Having survived the Red Guards, Pingyao became the site of an intense conservation battle in 1980, when the local government decided to \"rejuvenate\" the town by blasting six roads through its heart for car traffic.  One of Chinas most respected urban historians, Ruan Yisan of Shanghais Tongji University--who met Lin Huiyin in the early 1950s and attended lectures given by Liang Sicheng--arrived to halt the steamrollers.  He was given one month by the state governor to devise an alternative proposal.  Ruan took up residence in Pingyao with 11 of his best students and got to work, braving lice, rock-hard kang beds with coal burners beneath them for warmth, and continual bouts of dysentery.  Finally, Ruans plan was accepted, the roads were diverted and the old town of Pingyao was saved.  His efforts were rewarded when Unesco declared the entire town a World Heritage site in 1997.  Only today is it being discovered by foreign travelers.  The towns first upscale hotel, Jings Residence, is housed inside the magnificent 18th-century home of a wealthy silk merchant.  After an exacting renovation, it was opened in 2009 by a coal baroness named Yang Jing, who first visited Pingyao 22 years ago while running an export business.  Local craftsmen employed both ancient and contemporary designs in the interior, and the chef specializes in modern twists on traditional dishes, such as the local corned beef served with cats ear-shaped noodles.  Many Chinese are now visiting Pingyao, and although Prof.  Ruan Yisan is 82 years old, he returns every summer to monitor its condition and lead teams on renovation projects.  I met him over a banquet in an elegant courtyard, where he was addressing fresh-faced volunteers from France, Shanghai and Beijing for a project that would now be led by his grandson.  \"I learned from Liang Sichengs mistakes,\" he declared, waving his chopsticks theatrically.  \"He went straight into conflict with Chairman Mao.  It was a fight he couldnt win. \" Instead, Ruan said, he preferred to convince government officials that heritage preservation is in their own interest, helping them improve the economy by promoting tourism.  But, as ever, tourism is a delicate balancing act.  For the moment, Pingyao looks much as it did when Liang and Lin were traveling, but its population is declining and its hundreds of ornate wooden structures are fragile.  \"The larger public buildings, where admission can be charged, are very well maintained,\" Ruan explained.  \"The problem is now the dozens of residential houses that make up the actual texture of Pingyao, many of which are in urgent need of repair. \" He has started the Ruan Yisan Heritage Foundation to continue his efforts to preserve the town, and he believes a preservation spirit is spreading in Chinese society--if gradually.  The hotelier Yang Jing agrees: \"At first, most Chinese people found Pingyao too dirty,\" she said.  \"They certainly didnt understand the idea of a 'historic hotel, and would immediately ask to change to a bigger room, then leave after one night.  They wanted somewhere like a Hilton, with a big shiny bathroom. \" She added with a smile: \"But it has been slowly changing.  People are tired of Chinese cities that all look the same. \" Poring over Liang and Lins Illustrated History, I drew up a map of the couples greatest discoveries.  While Shanxi is little visited by travelers, its rural villages seem to have fallen off the charts entirely.  Nobody in Pingyao had even heard of the temples I spoke about, although they were included on detailed road charts.  So I was forced to cajole wary drivers to take me to visit the most sacred, forgotten spots.  Some, like the so-called Muta, Chinas tallest wooden pagoda dating from 1056, were easy to locate: The highway south of Datong runs alongside it, so it still rises gracefully over semi-suburban farmland.  Others, like the Guangsheng Temple, which Liang and Lin visited with the Fairbanks in 1934, involved a more concerted effort.  It lies in the hills near Linfen, now one of the most toxic of Shanxis coal outposts.  (In 2007, Linfen had the honor of being declared \"the worlds most polluted city. \") Much of the landscape is now completely disguised by industry: Mountains are stripped bare, highways are clogged with coal trucks.  Back in 1934, Lin Huiyin had written, \"When we arrived in Shanxi, the azure of the sky was nearly transparent, and the flowing clouds were mesmerizing. . . .  The beauty of such scenery pierced my heart and even hurt a little. \" Today, there are no hints of azure.  A gritty mist hangs over everything, concealing all views beyond a few hundred yards.  Its a haunted landscape where you never hear birds or see insects.  Here, the silent spring has already arrived.  Finally, the veil of pollution lifts as the road rises into the pine-covered hills.  The Lower Temple of Guangsheng is still announced by a bubbling emerald spring, as it was in 1934, and although many of the features were vandalized by Japanese troops and Red Guards, the ancient mural of the theatrical performance remains.  A monk, one of 20 who now live there, explained that the Upper Temple was more intact.  (\"The Red Guards were too lazy to climb there!\") I counted 436 steps up to the hill crest, where the lovely 13-story pagoda was still gleaming with colored glazed tiles.  Another monk was meditating cross-legged, as a cassette recorder played Om Mani Padme Hum.  I was determined to find the \"secret\" stairway.  After making endless inquiries, I convinced a guard to wake the abbot from his afternoon nap and got a key.  He led me into the pagoda and opened a grille to the second level, now followed by a couple of other curious monks.  It was pitch black, so I used the light from my iPhone to peer behind an enormous grinning Buddha.  Sure enough, there were worn stone steps leading up.  Wilma described the staircases unique design: \"We groped our way up in single file.  At the top of the first flight, we were startled to find that there were no landings.  When you bumped your head against a blank wall you knew you had come to the end of one flight of stairs.  You had to turn around there and step over empty space onto the first step of the next flight. \" I eagerly pressed ahead--but was soon blocked by another padlocked grille, whose key, the guard remembered, was kept by a government official in the faraway capital, no doubt in his desk drawer.  Still, as I crouched in the darkness, I could glimpse that the ancient architect really had not put a landing, for reasons we will never know.  Liang and Lins greatest triumph came three years later.  Their dream had always been to find a wooden temple from the golden age of Chinese art, the glorious Tang dynasty (A. D.  618-907).  It had always rankled that Japan claimed the oldest structures in the East, although there were references to far more ancient temples in China.  But after years of searching, the likelihood of finding a wooden building that had survived 11 centuries of wars, periodic religious persecutions, vandalism, decay and accidents had begun to seem fantastical.  (\"After all, a spark of incense could bring down an entire temple,\" Liang fretted. ) In June 1937, Liang and Lin set off hopefully into the sacred Buddhist mountain range of Wutai Shan, traveling by mule along serpentine tracks into the most verdant pocket of Shanxi, this time accompanied by a young scholar named Mo Zongjiang.  The group hoped that, while the most famous Tang structures had probably been rebuilt many times over, those on the less-visited fringes might have endured in obscurity.  The actual discovery must have had a cinematic quality.  On the third day, they spotted a low temple on a crest, surrounded by pine trees and caught in the last rays of sun.  It was called Foguang Si, the Temple of Buddhas Light.  As the monks led them through the courtyard to the East Hall, Liang and Lins excitement mounted: A glance at the eaves revealed its antiquity.  \"But could it be older than the oldest wooden structure we had yet found?\" Liang later wrote breathlessly.  Today, Wutai Shans otherworldly beauty is heightened by a blissful lack of pollution.  From winding country roads that seemed to climb forever, I looked down at immense views of the valleys, then stared up in grateful acknowledgment of the blue sky.  The summer air was cool and pure, and I noticed that many of the velvety green mountains were topped with their own mysterious monasteries.  The logistics of travel were also reminiscent of an earlier age.  Inside the rattling bus, pilgrims huddled over their nameless food items, each sending a pungent culinary odor into the exotic mix.  We arrived at the only town in the mountain range, a Chinese version of the Wild West, where the hotels seem to actually pride themselves on provincial inefficiency.  I took a room whose walls were covered in three types of mold.  In the muddy street below, dogs ran in and out of stores offering cheap incense and \"Auspicious Artifacts Wholesale. \" I quickly learned that the sight of foreigners is rare enough to provoke stares and requests for photographs.  And ordering in the restaurants is an adventure all its own, although one menu provided heroic English translations, evidently plucked from online dictionaries: Tiger Eggs with Burning Flesh, After the Noise Subspace, Delicious Larry, Elbow Sauce.  Back at my hotel, guests smoked in the hallways in their undershirts; on the street below, a rooster crowed from 3 a. m.  until dawn.  I could sympathize with Lin Huiyin, who complained in one letter to Wilma Fairbank that travel in rural China alternated between \"heaven and hell. \" (\"We rejoice over all the beauty and color in art and humanity,\" she wrote of the road, \"and are more than often appalled and dismayed by dirt and smells of places we have to eat and sleep. \") In the morning, I haggled with a driver to take me the last 23 miles to the Temple of Buddhas Light.  It is another small miracle that the Red Guards never made it to this lost valley, leaving the temple in much the same condition as when Liang and Lin stumbled here dust-covered on their mule litters.  I found it, just as they had, bathed in crystalline sunshine among the pine trees.  Across an immaculately swept courtyard, near-vertical stone stairs led up to the East Hall.  At the top, I turned around and saw that the view across the mountain ranges had been totally untouched by the modern age.  In 1937, when monks heaved open the enormous wooden portals, the pair was struck by a powerful stench: The temples roof was covered by thousands of bats, looking, according to Liang, \"like a thick spread of caviar. \" The travelers gazed in rapture as they took in the Tang murals and statues that rose \"like an enchanted deified forest. \" But most exciting were the designs of the roof, whose intricate trusses were in the distinctive Tang style: Here was a concrete example of a style hitherto known only from paintings and literary descriptions, and whose manner of construction historians could previously only guess.  Liang and Lin crawled over a layer of decaying bat corpses beneath the ceiling.  They were so excited to document details such as the \"crescent-moon beam,\" they didnt notice the hundreds of insect bites until later.  Their most euphoric moment came when Lin Huiyin spotted lines of ink calligraphy on a rafter, and the date \"The 11th year of Ta-chung, Tang Dynasty\"--A. D.  857 by the Western calendar, confirming that this was the oldest wooden building ever found in China.  (An older temple would be found nearby in the 1950s, but it was far more humble. ) Liang raved: \"The importance and unexpectedness of our find made this the happiest hours of my years of hunting for ancient architecture. \" Today, the bats have been cleared out, but the temple still has a powerful ammonia reek--the new residents being feral cats.  Liang and Lins discovery also had a certain ominous poignancy.  When they returned to civilization, they read their first newspaper in weeks --learning to their horror that while they were enraptured in the Temple of Buddhas Light, on July 7 the Japanese Army had attacked Beijing.  It was the beginning of a long nightmare for China, and decades of personal hardship for Liang and Lin.  In the agonizing years to come, they would return to this moment in Shanxi as the time of their greatest happiness.  \"Liang and Lins generation really suffered in China,\" says Hu Jingcao, director of the eight-part Chinese TV series on Liang and Lin.  \"In 1920s and 30s, they led such beautiful lives, but then they were plunged into such misery. \" Liang Sicheng outlived Lin by 17 years, and saw many of his dreams shattered as Beijing and many historical sites were destroyed by thoughtless development and rampaging Maoist cadres.  \"How could anyone succeed at that time?\" asked Hu Jingcao.  In the depths of the Sino-Japanese war in 1941, lying in her sickbed, Lin Huiyin had written a poem for an airman friend killed in combat: Lets not talk about who wronged you.  It was the age, hopeless, unweighable.  China has yet to move forward; dark night Waits its daybreak.  It could stand as an elegy for herself and her husband.  ********** Back in Beijing, I had one last pilgrimage to make.  Liang and Lins courtyard home in the 1930s is now a site that has become a contested symbol of the pairs complex legacy.  As the world knows, the Chinese capital is one of the worlds great planning disasters.  Even the better-educated taxi drivers talk with nostalgia of the plan Liang Sicheng once offered that would have made it a green, livable city.  (He even wanted to turn the top of the walls into a pedestrian park, anticipating the High Line in New York by six decades. ) According to activist He Shuzhong, founder of the Beijing Cultural Heritage Protection Center, the publics new fascination with Liang and Lin reflects a growing unease that development has gone too far in destroying the past: \"They had a vision of Beijing as a human-scale city,\" he said, \"which is now nothing but a dream. \" From the relative calm of the Peninsula Hotel near the Forbidden City, I walked for 20 minutes along an avenue of gleaming skyscrapers toward the roaring din of the Second Ring Road, built on the outline of the city walls destroyed by Mao.  (On the evening before the wrecking balls arrived, Liang sat on the walls and wept. ) Hidden behind a noodle bar was the entrance to one of the few remaining hutongs, or narrow lane ways, that once made Beijing such an enchanting historical bastion.  (The American city planner Edmund Bacon, who spent a year working in China in the 1930s, described Old Beijing as \"possibly the greatest single work of man on the face of the earth. \") Number 24 Bei Zong Bu was where Liang and Lin spent some of their happiest days, hosting salons for their haute-bohemian friends, which included the Fairbanks--discussing the latest news in European art and Chinese literature, and the gossip from Harvard Square.  The future challenges for Chinese preservationists are inscribed in the story of this site.  In 2007, the ten families who occupied the mansion were moved out, and plans were made to redevelop the area.  But an instant outcry led Liang and Lins house, although damaged, to be declared an \"immovable cultural relic. \" Then, in the lull before Chinese New Year in 2012, a construction company with links to the government simply moved in and destroyed the house overnight.  When the company was slapped with a token $80,000 fine, outrage flooded social media sites, and even some state-owned newspapers condemned the destruction.  Preservationists were at least heartened by the outcry and described it as Chinas \"Penn Station moment,\" referring to the destruction of the New York landmark in 1966 that galvanized the U. S.  preservation movement.  When I arrived at the address, it was blocked off by a high wall of corrugated iron.  Two security guards eyed me suspiciously as I poked my head inside to see a construction site, where a half-built courtyard house, modeled on the ancient original, stood surrounded by rubble.  In a typically surreal Chinese gesture, Liang and Lins home is now being recreated from plans and photographs as a simulacrum, although no official announcements have been made about its future status as a memorial.  Despite powerful obstacles, preservationists remain cautiously optimistic about the future.  \"Yes, many Chinese people are still indifferent to their heritage,\" admits He Shuzhong.  \"The general public, government officials, even some university professors only want neighborhoods to be bigger, brighter, with more designer stores! But I think the worst period of destruction is over.  The protests over Liang and Lins house show that people are valuing their heritage in a way they werent five years ago. \" How public concern can be translated into government policy in authoritarian China remains to be seen--the sheer amount of money behind new developments, and the levels of corruption often seem to be unstoppable--but the growing number of supporters shows that historic preservation may soon be based on more than just hope.  ********** On my return to Manhattan, Maya Lin recalled that it wasnt until she was 21 that her father told her about her celebrated aunt.  He admitted that his \"adoration\" of his older sister, Lin Huiyin, had made him invert the traditional Chinese favoritism for sons, and place all his hopes and attention on her.  \"My whole life was framed by my fathers respect for Lin Huiyin,\" she marveled.  The artist showed me a model for a postmodern bell tower she is designing for Shantou University, in Guangdong province, China.  Whereas Liang Sicheng and Lin Huiyin never had the opportunity to solely design any great buildings, the newly rich China has become one of the worlds hotbeds of innovative contemporary architecture.  \"You could say that Lins passion for art and architecture flows through me,\" Maya said.  \"Now Im doing what she wanted to. \" Chinese Architecture: Art and Artifacts Buy"}}

He is also the co-founder of the metal bands Divine Heresy, Asesino, and Brujeria.  Cazares popularized the use of digital amp modelling processors, as well as the use of seven and eight-string guitars in metal music. Cazares met singer Burton C.  Bell in 1989 and started a group under the name Ulceration, which was renamed to their current name Fear Factory in the following year with Raymond Herrera on drums.  The band's first album, Soul of a New Machine, was dedicated to Cazares' mother, Natividad, and older brother, Joey.  Before starting Fear Factory, Cazares was in the grindcore band Excruciating Terror, which he quit after one month.  He co-founded the Mexican death/grind side-project Brujeria, formed in 1989 with members of Faith No More, Fear Factory, among other well-known bands.  When Fear Factory split up (temporarily) in 2002, Cazares returned to Brujeria, and released what was supposed to be the first of 13 Demoniaco Brujeria records (one for each member of Brujeria).  He formed the band Asesino the same year, it featured himself with Static-X bassist Tony Campos on bass and vocals, and Emilio Marquez on drums.  Fear Factory reformed later that year without Cazares.  In 2005, Cazares was chosen as a team captain by Roadrunner A&R Monte Conner for the Roadrunner United album for which he wrote four songs and contributed with other Roadrunner Records artists.  Cazares formed Divine Heresy in 2005, who released their debut album Bleed the Fifth in August 2007.  The band got signed to Roadrunner Records and Century Media, and included Tim Yeung (All That Remains, Hate Eternal, Nile, Vital Remains, Morbid Angel) on drums, Thomas Cummings on vocals and (later on) Joe Payne (Nile) on bass.  Cummings was terminated from the band in 2008 and was replaced by Travis Neal. Their second album Bringer of Plagues was released on July 28, 2009.  Cazares in 2008 In 2009, Cazares rejoined Fear Factory and has released four albums with them since.  Divine Heresy has been inactive due to Cazares' commitment to Fear Factory and several departures that took place. Cazares has voiced a minor character in the adult swim TV show Metalocalypse.  In January 2019, Cazares announced his divorce from Jennifer Pagan Cazares on Twitter. Starting in August 2021, Cazares toured with Soulfly as their guitar player. He continues to play with Soulfly for their 35-date tour from February through March of 2022. On April 7, 2009, Cazares and ex-bandmate Burton C.  Bell announced the reconciliation of their friendship, and the formation of a new project with Byron Stroud (Strapping Young Lad) on bass and Gene Hoglan (Death, Strapping Young Lad, Dethklok) on drums.  On April 28, this project was revealed to actually be a new version of Fear Factory, minus founding member Raymond Herrera and longtime member Christian Olde Wolbers.  Bell, when asked why Herrera and Wolbers were not included, stated that \"Fear Factory's like a business and I'm just reorganizing. . . We won't talk about [their exclusion]. Cazares is often identified by his fast alternate picking rhythm guitar technique, timing palm muted triplets and syncopated sixteenth notes with double bass drumming.  This has led to a distinctive \"machine-gun\" style identifiable in the music of Fear Factory.  In previous Fear Factory albums, Cazares did not play any guitar solos in Fear Factory for stylistic reasons, but can be heard playing them in his other bands.  However, the band's 2010 album, Mechanize, has several lead parts and solos. For the longest time, Cazares was endorsed by Ibanez guitars, specifically custom-made 7-string models with Seymour Duncan Blackouts pickups installed.  They were usually detuned a whole step (A,D,G,C,F,A,D; from Obsolete on) to allow for even lower registers.  His main guitar in Asesino is an Ibanez prototype 8-string guitar (standard tuning F#,B,E,A,D,G,B,E) loaded with 2 Seymour Duncan Blackout 8 active pickups.  Before using Ibanez guitars, his main instrument was a black custom shop ESP M 6-string guitar with a single EMG 81 in the bridge, detuned to B tuning.  This can be seen in the video for the song \"Replica\".  His first known Ibanez 7-string is an Ibanez Universe UV7SBK \"Silver Dot\", with a modified pickguard to fit a single passive pickup and a volume knob.  He was also known to have an Ibanez Universe UV777BK with similar modifications, except with an EMG 7-string prototype instead of a passive pickup.  In January 2015, Ibanez announced a signature model for Dino Cazares, the DCM100.  It is based on the Ibanez RGD platform, including the 26. 5in scale, but features a mahogany body, maple neck with bubinga strip, offset dot inlays, Lo-Pro Edge tremolo, and a single Seymour Duncan Retribution pickup.  This guitar makes Cazares one of only 4 Ibanez signature artists to have a signature 7-string guitar.  After being with the company for 22 years, he switch endorsement from Ibanez to Ormsby Guitars, a company based in Perth, Australia.  He announced the partnership in January 2019, as well as a line of signature models, two of these being revealed at the 2019 Winter NAMM Show.  In the early days, his guitar tone derived from a modified Marshall JCM800 head with scooped mids and high treble settings to produce the thrashy, chugging tone which has been so influential to the metal genre.  After it was stolen, he switched to the Line 6 POD Pro with a Mesa/Boogie tube power amp.  This setup was used to record Digimortal.  Cazares later endorsed the Line 6 Vetta II HD, as well as a POD X3 Pro processor into a Mesa/Boogie tube power amp and Mesa/Boogie oversized Rectifier 4x12 cabinets.  When playing live, Cazares mostly uses the speaker cabinets for monitoring, or does not use them at all, since his signal is also run into the venue's PA.  In 2011, Cazares replaced the POD X3 Pro for the POD HD Pro.  He also replaced his Mesa/Boogie tube power amp for a Matrix GT800FX 800W solid state power amp, and his Mesa/Boogie Rectifier 4x12 for a custom cabinet built by David Laboga.  Sometime in 2012 or 2013, Cazares eventually switched from Line6 to Fractal Audio, making use of their Axe-FX II.  This was short lived, as he would soon switch to using a Kemper Profiling Amp, an amplifier that could \"profile\" other guitar amps, allowing him to get a tone similar to previous albums.  With Divine Heresy, he used an old Marshall Valvestate VS100 head, Marshall JCM800, and a Peavey 5150 head boosted with an Ibanez TS-9.  In 2007, Cazares switched from EMG active pickups to Seymour Duncan AHB-1 Blackout active pickups, which he helped design with Duncan.  In 2014, Seymour Duncan announced the Blackout Retribution pickups, which are a signature set of pickups designed with less output and more treble than a standard Blackout set. A detailed gear diagram of Dino Cazares' 2001 Fear Factory guitar rig is well-documented. Asesino  Fear Factory  Studio albums  EP  Demo  Compilations  Brujeria  Studio albums  EPs  !Demoniaco!

Bell quit the seminal industrial-metal band to focus on his goth project Ascension of the Watchers, and founding guitarist Dino Cazares took sole control of the ship, with the two hurling barbs at each other in the press following the split.  Since then, the question has hung in the air: Who will be Fear Factory's new vocalist? Cazares has said that he intends to reveal the identity of Burton's replacement in early 2023, around the time that the band is set to hit the road again.  In the meantime, he recently appeared on The Jasta Show podcast and shared his dream pick for the job.  \"The No.  1 guy would be Mike Patton,\" the guitarist told the Hatebreed frontman, as transcribed by Metal Injection.  \"If Mike Patton said, 'Hey, I'm singing for you guys,' [I'd say] 'OK. ' There's no hesitation at all, whatsoever.  He's one of those guys that can do it all, and you know it's gonna be exciting, charismatic -- you know it's gonna be interesting every night. \" As cool as it might be to see Patton singing for Fear Factory, don't get your hopes up.  Between Dead Cross' imminent new album, II, and Mr.  Bungle live dates in December, the man of a thousand voices -- who is still recovering from a mental health crisis that sidelined him over the last couple years -- has his slate pretty full. ", "article_2": "FEAR FACTORY's Dino Cazares is playing guitar for SOULFLY on the Max Cavalera-fronted band's current U. S.  tour which kicked off on August 20 at Launchpad in Albuquerque, New Mexico.  The 33-date trek will conclude in Tempe, Arizona on September 25.  Max and Dino discussed their expectations for the tour in a four-minute video that was filmed during the pre-tour rehearsals in Phoenix, Arizona and has just been uploaded to the SOULFLY YouTube channel.  Max said (as transcribed by BLABBERMOUTH. NET): \"What I'm looking most [forward to on] this tour with Dino, apart from everything that we've been through, I think it's a celebration of our passion for metal, and our roads meet up again, this time in the form of a tour.  And I think it's really cool because we have a lot of the similar fans -- a lot of FEAR FACTORY fans are SOULFLY fans; they like both bands anyway.  So it's almost like it's gonna be a little bit of a dream come true for all these fans to see the both of us on a stage jamming [and] ripping.  And for me, as a Dino fan, before he even got here [to our rehearsal space], I was trying to imagine how sick the songs are gonna sound with that crunchy Dino sound on some of the stuff that has never really sounded this aggressive -- just like machine-tight riffing, just make the songs tighter.  And he learned everything like the records, which is amazing.  So we're playing stuff like 'Fire', 'Bleed' and 'Boom' the way it's on the record, which we never did before.  And apart from that, [I'm] also just looking forward to having him on the road and telling stories and joking around, 'cause we do that.  It's professional -- we love being professional -- but you've also gotta enjoy what you do; you've gotta have fun with it.  And the whole crew tried to really welcome Dino into the SOULFLY camp.  I think it's really cool.  He told me even the SOULFLY tribe, all the fans embraced him into our camp, into our tribe.  And to me, it's gonna be a unique opportunity.  'Cause he's in FEAR FACTORY, so, of course, he's not joining SOULFLY.  But I really think this is a special thing we're doing.  And who knows what's gonna come out of this? But it's gonna be amazing.  The shows are gonna be amazing.  And I'm very, very much looking forward to showcasing everything we've been working [on] here.  It's gonna be just a very, very special SOULFLY tour -- [more] different than any other tour we've ever had. \" Added Dino: \"What I'm really most excited about is all of it.  From our history that we've had since the first time I met him.  Actually, playing these songs and hanging out with him, all these memories are going through my mind.  Being alongside, next to my brother and playing these riffs, it's gonna be killer.  I can't wait for that.  'Cause a lot of times, over the years, he's invited me on stage to play a song or two -- usually 'Eye For An Eye' -- but now I'm gonna be able to do a whole set with him, which is really killer.  I can't wait to see the smiles on kids' faces, to see me and him jamming together.  And I'm really, really thankful that they've welcomed me into their family.  I say that now, but I've always been a part of the family.  But just being here and being in Arizona and rehearsing with everybody and just how warm everybody is and how they all take care of each other and we all take care of each other as well, and it's just really good to be here.  And I can't wait to get out there and for those kids to see our styles collide.  It's gonna be killer. \" When his addition to SOULFLY's touring lineup was first announced, Cazares said in a statement: \"The first time I met Max in 1991, I knew we were going to be longtime friends.  I was standing at the bar, he grabbed my arm and yelled 'Papa Capado. ' I was like 'who the [email protected]#% are you? He said 'I'm Max' and from there we just hit it off.  That same night I played him the FEAR FACTORY demo tape on his cassette Walkman in his hotel room while we were attending a music convention in Los Angeles.  He liked it so much that he wouldn't give it back, so I had to wrestle him and take it out of his Walkman, haha.  It was my only copy.  Max told Monte Conner, the A&R director from Roadrunner Records, that we had a new demo that he needed to check out, so our manager at the time sent our demo to Monte after many labels turned us down.  The rest is history.  \"Over the past 30 years, I've guested on a few of Max's projects and jumped on stage whenever and wherever I could.  Now it's a great honor to be doing this tour alongside Max as the second guitarist.  It's going to be amazing for all the fans to see the two of us playing a selection of SOULFLY songs and a few familiar extras.  \"Much respect to Max and his family -- thank you for always making me feel at home with the SOULFLY Tribe.  Let's do this!!!! Um Dois Tres Quatro\".  Although longtime SOULFLY guitarist Marc Rizzo's departure from the band wasn't officially announced until August 7, it was widely speculated that he was out of the group two days earlier when it was revealed that Dino would play guitar for SOULFLY on the current tour.

He is often called \"the richest man in Rome. \" Crassus began his public career as a military commander under Lucius Cornelius Sulla during his civil war.  Following Sulla's assumption of the dictatorship, Crassus amassed an enormous fortune through real estate speculation.  Crassus rose to political prominence following his victory over the slave revolt led by Spartacus, sharing the consulship with his rival Pompey the Great.  A political and financial patron of Julius Caesar, Crassus joined Caesar and Pompey in the unofficial political alliance known as the First Triumvirate.  Together, the three men dominated the Roman political system, but the alliance did not last long, due to the ambitions, egos, and jealousies of the three men.  While Caesar and Crassus were lifelong allies, Crassus and Pompey disliked each other and Pompey grew increasingly envious of Caesar's spectacular successes in the Gallic Wars.  The alliance was restabilized at the Luca Conference in 56 BC, after which Crassus and Pompey again served jointly as consuls.  Following his second consulship, Crassus was appointed as the governor of Roman Syria.  Crassus used Syria as the launchpad for a military campaign against the Parthian Empire, Rome's long-time eastern enemy.  Crassus' campaign was a disastrous failure, ending in his defeat and death at the Battle of Carrhae.  Crassus' death permanently unraveled the alliance between Caesar and Pompey, since his political influence and wealth had been a counterbalance to the two greater militarists.  Within four years of Crassus' death, Caesar crossed the Rubicon and began a civil war against Pompey and the optimates. Marcus Licinius Crassus was a member of the gens Licinia, an old and highly respected plebeian family in Rome.  He was the second of three sons born to the eminent senator and vir triumphalis Publius Licinius Crassus (consul 95 BC, censor 89 BC).  This line was not descended from the wealthy Crassi Divites, although often assumed to be.  The eldest brother, Publius (born c.  116 BC), died shortly before the Italic War, and Crassus' father and younger brother were either slain or took their own lives in Rome, in winter 87-86 BC, when being hunted down by the supporters of Gaius Marius, following their victory in the Bellum Octavianum. Crassus had the unusual distinction of marrying his wife Tertulla after she had been widowed by his brother.  There were three main branches of the house of the Licinii Crassi in the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, and many mistakes in identifications and lines have arisen owing to the uniformity of Roman nomenclature, erroneous modern suppositions, and the unevenness of information across the generations.  In addition, the Dives cognomen of the Crassi Divites means rich or wealthy, and since Marcus Crassus, the subject here, was renowned for his enormous wealth, this has contributed to hasty assumptions that his family belonged to the Divites.  But no ancient source accords him or his father the Dives cognomen; in fact, we are explicitly informed that his great wealth was acquired rather than inherited, and that he was raised in modest circumstances. Crassus' grandfather of the same name, Marcus Licinius Crassus (praetor c.  126 BC), was facetiously given the Greek nickname Agelastus (the unlaughing or grim) by his contemporary Gaius Lucilius, the inventor of Roman satire, who asserted that he smiled once in his whole life.  This grandfather was son of Publius Licinius Crassus.  The latter's brother, Gaius Licinius Crassus (consul 168 BC), produced the third line of Licinii Crassi of the period, the most famous of whom was Lucius Licinius Crassus, the greatest Roman orator before Cicero and the latter's childhood hero and model.  Marcus Crassus was also a talented orator and one of the most energetic and active advocates of his time. After the Marian purges and the subsequent sudden death of Gaius Marius, the surviving consul Lucius Cornelius Cinna (father-in-law of Julius Caesar) imposed proscriptions on those surviving Roman senators and equestrians who had supported Lucius Cornelius Sulla in his 88 BC march on Rome and overthrow of the traditional Roman political arrangements.  Cinna's proscription forced Crassus to flee to Hispania. He stayed in Spain from 87 to 84 BC.  Here, he recruited 2,500 men (an understrength legion) from his father's clients settled in the area.  Crassus used his army to extort money from the local cities to pay for his campaigns, even being accused of sacking Malaca. After Cinna's death in 84 BC, Crassus went to the Roman province of Africa and joined Metellus Pius, one of Sulla's closest allies, but did not stay there for long because of disagreements with Metellus.  He sailed his army to Greece and joined Sulla, \"with whom he stood in a position of special honor. \" During Sulla's civil war, Crassus and Pompey fought a battle in the plain of Spoletium (Spoleto), killed about 3,000 of the men of Papirius Carbo, the leader of the Marian forces, and besieged Carrinas, a Marian commander. During the decisive battle outside the Colline Gate, Crassus commanded the right flank of Sulla's army.  After almost a day of fighting, the battle was going poorly for Sulla; his own center was being pushed back and was on the verge of collapse when he got word from Crassus that he had comprehensively crushed the enemy before him.  Crassus wanted to know whether Sulla needed assistance, or whether his men could retire.  Sulla told him to advance on the enemy's center, and used the news of Crassus' success to stiffen the resolve of his own troops.  By the following morning, the battle was over, and the Sullan army emerged victorious, making Sulla the master of Rome.  Sulla's victory, and Crassus' contribution to it, put Crassus in a key position.  Sulla was as loyal to his allies as he was cruel towards his enemies, and Crassus had been a very loyal ally. Marcus Licinius Crassus' next concern was to rebuild the fortunes of his family, which had been confiscated during the Marian-Cinnan proscriptions.  Sulla's proscriptions, in which the property of his victims was cheaply auctioned off, found one of the greatest acquirers of this type of property in Crassus: indeed, Sulla was especially supportive of this, because he wished to spread the blame as much as possible among those unscrupulous enough to do so.  Sulla's proscriptions ensured that his survivors would recoup their lost fortunes from the fortunes of wealthy adherents to Gaius Marius or Lucius Cornelius Cinna.  Proscriptions meant that their political enemies lost their fortunes and their lives; that their female relatives (notably, widows and widowed daughters) were forbidden to marry, remarry or remain married; and that, in some cases, their families' hopes of rebuilding their fortunes and political significance were destroyed.  Crassus is said to have made part of his money from proscriptions, notably the proscription of one man whose name was not initially on the list of those proscribed but was added by Crassus, who coveted the man's fortune. Crassus' wealth is estimated by Pliny at approximately 200 million sesterces.  Plutarch, in his Life of Crassus, says the wealth of Crassus increased from less than 300 talents at first, to 7,100 talents. This represented 229 tonnes of gold, or about 7. 4 million troy ounces, worth about US$13. 7 billion at November 2021 gold prices, accounted right before his Parthian expedition, most of which Plutarch declares Crassus got \"by fire and war, making the public calamities his greatest source of revenue. \" Some of Crassus' wealth was acquired conventionally, through slave trafficking, production from silver mines, and speculative real estate purchases.  Crassus bought property that was confiscated in proscriptions and by notoriously purchasing burnt and collapsed buildings.  Plutarch wrote that, observing how frequent such occurrences were, he bought slaves \"who were architects and builders. \" When he had over 500 slaves, he bought houses that had burnt and the adjacent ones \"because their owners would let go at a trifling price. \" He bought \"the largest part of Rome\" in this way, buying them on the cheap and rebuilding them with slave labor.  The first ever Roman fire brigade was created by Crassus.  Fires were almost a daily occurrence in Rome, and Crassus took advantage of the fact that Rome had no fire department, by creating his own brigade--500 men strong--which rushed to burning buildings at the first cry of alarm.  Upon arriving at the scene, however, the firefighters did nothing while Crassus offered to buy the burning building from the distressed property owner, at a miserable price.  If the owner agreed to sell the property, his men would put out the fire; if the owner refused, then they would simply let the structure burn to the ground.  After buying many properties this way, he rebuilt them, and often leased the properties to their original owners or new tenants. Crassus befriended Licinia, a Vestal Virgin, whose valuable property he coveted.  Plutarch says \"And yet, when he was further on in years, he was accused of criminal intimacy with Licinia, one of the vestal virgins, and Licinia was formally prosecuted by a certain Plotius.  Now, Licinia was the owner of a pleasant villa in the suburbs, which Crassus wished to get at a low price, and it was for this reason that he was forever hovering about the woman and paying his court to her, until he fell under the abominable suspicion.  And, in a way, it was his avarice that absolved him from the charge of corrupting the vestal, and he was acquitted by the judges.  But he did not let Licinia go until he had acquired her property. \" After rebuilding his fortune, Crassus' next concern was his political career.  As a wealthy man in Rome, an adherent of Sulla, and a man who hailed from a line of consuls and praetors, Crassus' political future was apparently assured.  His problem was that, despite his military successes, he was eclipsed by his contemporary Pompey the Great.  Crassus' rivalry with Pompey and his envy of Pompey's triumph would influence his subsequent career. Crassus was elected praetor in 73 BC and pursued the cursus honorum.  During the Third Servile War, or Spartacus' revolt (73-71 BC), Crassus offered to equip, train, and lead new troops at his own expense, after several legions had been defeated and their commanders killed in battle.  Crassus was sent into battle against Spartacus by the Senate.  At first, he had trouble both in anticipating Spartacus' moves and in inspiring his army to strengthen their morale.  When a segment of his army fled from battle, abandoning their weapons, Crassus revived the ancient practice of decimation - i. e.  executing one out of every ten men, with the victims selected by drawing lots.  Plutarch reports that \"many things horrible and dreadful to see\" occurred during the infliction of punishment, which was witnessed by the rest of Crassus' army. Nevertheless, according to Appian, the troops' fighting spirit improved dramatically thereafter, since Crassus had demonstrated that \"he was more dangerous to them than the enemy. \" Afterwards, when Spartacus retreated to the Bruttium peninsula in the southwest of Italy, Crassus tried to pen up the slave armies by building a ditch and a rampart across the peninsula of Rhegium in Bruttium, \"from sea to sea. \" Despite this remarkable feat, Spartacus and part of his army still managed to break out.  On the night of a heavy snowstorm, they sneaked through Crassus' lines and made a bridge of dirt and tree branches over the ditch, thus escaping. Some time later, when the Roman armies led by Pompey and Varro Lucullus were recalled to Italy in support of Crassus, Spartacus decided to fight rather than find himself and his followers trapped between three armies, two of them returning from overseas action.  In this last battle, the battle of the Silarius river, Crassus gained a decisive victory, and captured six thousand slaves alive.  During the fighting, Spartacus attempted to personally kill Crassus, slaughtering his way toward the general's position, but he succeeded only in killing two of the centurions guarding Crassus. Spartacus himself is believed to have been killed in the battle, although his body was never recovered.  The six thousand captured slaves were crucified along the Via Appia by Crassus' orders.  At his command, their bodies were not taken down afterwards, but remained rotting along Rome's principal route to the south.  This was intended as an abject lesson to anyone who might think of rebelling against Rome in the future, particularly of slave insurrections against their owners and masters, the Roman citizens.  Crassus effectively ended the Third Servile War in 71 BC.  In Plutarch's account, Crassus \"had written to the Senate that they must summon Lucullus from Thrace and Pompey from Spain, but he was sorry now that he had done so, and was eager to bring the war to an end before those generals came.  He knew that the success would be ascribed to the one who came up with assistance, and not to himself. \" He decided to attack a splinter group of rebels, and after this, Spartacus withdrew to the mountains.  Pompey had arrived from Hispania with his veterans and was sent to provide reinforcements.  Crassus hurried to seek the final battle, which he won.  Pompey arrived in time to deal with the disorganized and defeated fugitives, writing to the Senate that \"indeed, Crassus had conquered the slaves, but that he himself had extirpated the war. \" \"Crassus, for all his self-approval, did not venture to ask for the major triumph, and it was thought ignoble and mean in him to celebrate even the minor triumph on foot, called the ovation,\" nor did he wish to be honored for subduing slaves.  In Plutarch's account, Pompey was asked to stand for the consulship.  Crassus wanted to become his colleague and asked Pompey for his assistance.  As said in the Life of Crassus, \"Pompey received his request gladly (for he was desirous of having Crassus, in some way or other, always in debt to him for some favor), eagerly promoted his candidature, and finally said in a speech to the assembly that he should be no less grateful to them for the colleague than for the office which he desired. \" However, in office, they did not remain friendly.  They \"differed on almost every measure, and by their contentiousness, rendered their consulship barren politically and without achievement. \" Crassus displayed his wealth by realizing public sacrifices to Hercules, entertaining the populace at 10,000 tables and distributing sufficient grain to last each family three months, an act that had the additional ends of performing a previously made religious vow of a tithe to the demigod Hercules and also to gain support among the members of the popular party.  In Appian's account, when Crassus ended the rebellion, there was a contention over honors between him and Pompey.  Neither men dismissed their armies, with both being candidates for the consulship.  Crassus had been praetor as the law of Sulla required.  Pompey had been neither praetor nor quaestor, and was only 34 years old, but he had promised the plebeian tribunes to restore much of their power, that had been taken away by Sulla's constitutional reforms.  Even when they were both chosen consuls, they did not dismiss their armies stationed near the city.  Pompey said that he was awaiting the return of Metellus for his Spanish triumph; Crassus said that Pompey ought to dismiss his army first.  In the end, Crassus yielded first, offering Pompey his hand. In 65 BC, Crassus was elected censor with another conservative, Quintus Lutatius Catulus Capitolinus, himself son of a consul.  During that decade, Crassus was Julius Caesar's patron in all but name, financing Caesar's successful election to become pontifex maximus.  Caesar had formerly been the priest of Jupiter, or flamen dialis, but had been deprived of office by Sulla.  Crassus also supported Caesar's efforts to win command of military campaigns.  Caesar's mediation between Crassus and Pompey led to the creation of the First Triumvirate in 60 BC, consisting of Crassus, Pompey, and Caesar (who became consul in 59 BC).  This coalition would last until Crassus' death.  In 54 BC, Crassus looted the Jewish Temple treasury. In 55 BC, after the Triumvirate met at the Lucca Conference in 56 BC, Crassus was again consul with Pompey, and a law was passed assigning the provinces of the two Hispanias and Syria to Pompey and Crassus, respectively, for five years. Crassus received Syria as his province, which promised to be an inexhaustible source of wealth.  It might have been, had he not also sought military glory and crossed the Euphrates in an attempt to conquer Parthia.  Crassus attacked Parthia not only because of its great source of riches, but because of a desire to match the military victories of his two major rivals, Pompey the Great and Julius Caesar.  The king of Armenia, Artavazdes II, offered Crassus the aid of nearly 40,000 troops (10,000 cataphracts and 30,000 infantrymen) on the condition that Crassus invade through Armenia so that the king could not only maintain the upkeep of his own troops but also provide a safer route for his men and Crassus. Crassus refused, and chose the more direct route by crossing the Euphrates, as he had done in his successful campaign in the previous year.  Crassus received directions from the Osroene chieftain Ariamnes, who had previously assisted Pompey in his eastern campaigns. Ariamnes was in the pay of the Parthians and urged Crassus to attack at once, falsely stating that the Parthians were weak and disorganized.  He then led Crassus' army into desolate desert, far from any water.  In 53 BC, at the battle of Carrhae (modern Harran, in Turkey), Crassus' legions were defeated by a numerically inferior Parthian force.  Crassus' legions were primarily heavy infantry, but were not prepared for the type of swift, cavalry-and-arrow attack in which Parthian troops were particularly adept.  The Parthian horse archers devastated the unprepared Romans with hit-and-run techniques and feigned retreats with the ability to shoot as well backwards as they could forwards. Crassus refused his quaestor Gaius Cassius Longinus' plans to reconstitute the Roman battle line, and remained in the testudo formation to protect his flanks until the Parthians eventually ran out of arrows.  However, the Parthians had stationed camels carrying arrows to allow their archers to continually reload and relentlessly barrage the Romans until dusk.  Despite taking severe casualties, the Romans successfully retreated to Carrhae, forced to leave many wounded behind to be later slaughtered by the Parthians.  \"The torture of Crassus,\" 1530s, Louvre Subsequently, Crassus' men, being near mutiny, demanded he parley with the Parthians, who had offered to meet with him.  Crassus, despondent at the death of his son Publius in the battle, finally agreed to meet the Parthian general Surena; however, when Crassus mounted a horse to ride to the Parthian camp for a peace negotiation, his junior officer Octavius suspected a Parthian trap and grabbed Crassus' horse by the bridle, instigating a sudden fight with the Parthians that left the Roman party dead, including Crassus. A story later emerged to the effect that, after Crassus' death, the Parthians poured molten gold into his mouth in symbolic mockery of his thirst for wealth. It has also been documented that the severed head of Crassus was used as a prop in the Parthian adaptation of the Euripides play The Bacchae.  The account given in Plutarch's biography of Crassus also mentions that, during the feasting and revelry in the wedding ceremony of Artavazdes' sister to the Parthian king Orodes II's son and heir Pacorus in the Armenian capital of Artashat, Crassus' head was brought to Orodes II. Both kings were enjoying a performance of Euripides' Greek tragedy The Bacchae when a certain actor of the royal court, named Jason of Tralles, took the head and sang the following verses (also from the Bacchae): We bring from the mountain A tendril fresh-cut to the palace A wonderful prey. Crassus' head was thus used in place of a prop head representing Pentheus and carried by the character of Agave. Also according to Plutarch, a final mockery was made ridiculing the memory of Crassus, by dressing up a Roman prisoner, Caius Paccianus, who resembled him in appearance, in women's clothing, calling him \"Crassus\" and \"imperator,\" and leading him in a spectacular show of a final, mock \"triumphal procession,\" putting to ridiculous use the traditional symbols of Roman triumph and authority. 115 BC - Crassus is born in Rome, second of three sons of Publius Licinius Crassus (cos.  97 BC, cens.  89 BC); 97 BC - Father is consul of Rome; 87 BC - Crassus flees to Hispania from Marian forces; 84 BC - Joins Sulla against Marius; 82 BC - Commands the victorious right wing of Sulla's army at the Colline Gate, the decisive battle of the civil war, fought on Kalends of November; 78 BC - Sulla dies in the spring; 73 BC - Revolt of Spartacus, probable year Crassus was praetor (it's possible for him to have done so between 75 and 73 BC); 72 BC - Crassus is given special command of the war against Spartacus following the ignominious defeats of both consuls; 71 BC - Crassus destroys the remaining slave armies in the spring, and is elected consul in the summer; 70 BC - Consulship of Crassus and Pompey; 65 BC - Crassus is censor with Quintus Lutatius Catulus; 63 BC - Catiline conspiracy; 59 BC - First Triumvirate formed, with Caesar as consul; 56 BC - Conference at Lucca; 55 BC - Second consulship of Crassus and Pompey, with Crassus leaving for Syria in November; 54 BC - Campaign against the Parthians; 53 BC - Crassus dies in the Battle of Carrhae.

", "article_1": "Marcus Licinius Crassus, (born c.  115 bc--died 53), politician who in the last years of the Roman Republic formed the so-called First Triumvirate with Julius Caesar and Pompey to challenge effectively the power of the Senate.  His death led to the outbreak of the Civil War between Caesar and Pompey (49-45).  Crassus fled from Rome when Gaius Marius captured the city in 87.  As a young officer, he supported Lucius Cornelius Sulla during the civil war (83-82) between Sulla and the followers of Marius, returning to Rome to help Sulla seize power in 82.  The hostility between Pompey and Crassus probably originated in Sullas clear preference for Pompey.  Crassus held the praetorship c.  73, and in 72-71 he put down the slave uprising led by Spartacus, although Pompey managed to take the credit.  Crassus and Pompey cooperated to pressure the Senate to elect them to the consulship for 70; once in office they overthrew parts of the Sullan constitution.  During the 60s, while Pompey was scoring military victories abroad, Crassus was building a political following at Rome.  He used his great wealth--derived largely from the sale of property confiscated by Sulla--to extend credit to indebted senators.  The young Julius Caesar was helped in this fashion in 62.  In 65 Crassus served as censor.  In 60 Crassus joined with Pompey and Caesar to form the so-called First Triumvirate.  Crassus entered this informal coalition partly to effect passage of laws helpful to his business ventures in Asia.  From 58 to 56 he supported efforts to neutralize Pompeys power.  He and Pompey were reconciled at a meeting of the three leaders at Luca, Etruria, in 56, and in the following year they were both again made consuls.  As governor of Syria in 54, Crassus attempted to gain military glory by embarking on an unwarranted invasion of Parthia, to the east.  He was defeated and killed at the Battle of Carrhae (see Carrhae, Battle of) in southern Anatolia. ", "article_2": "Marcus Licinius Crassus (115-53 BCE) was perhaps the richest man in Roman history and in his eventful life he experienced both great successes and severe disappointments.  His vast wealth and sharp political skills brought him two consulships and the kind of influence enjoyed only by a true heavyweight of Roman politics.  A mentor to Julius Caesar in his early career, Crassus would rise to the very top of state affairs but his long search for a military triumph to match his great rival Pompey would, ultimately, bring about his downfall.  Early Success Crassus was the son of Publius Licinius Crassus, who was consul in 97 BCE and a commander in Iberia, even gaining a triumph for his victories in Lusitania in 93 BCE.  In 87 BCE, on the losing side against the forces of Gaius Marius and Cornelius Cinna, he committed suicide and the young Crassus fled to Spain.  Following Cinna's death, Crassus sided with Sulla against Marius, and, as one of his most able commanders, helped him gain control of Italy.  Following victory, Crassus now also seized the opportunity to vastly increase his personal wealth from the confiscation of the assets of declared enemies of the state (proscription) which included property, riches and a huge number of slaves.  Remove Ads Advertisement In private life Crassus was married to Tertulla and he had two sons, one of whom shared his name and the other - Publius Licinius Crassus - fought with him in Parthia.  Marcus Licinius Crassus the younger enjoyed some military success, notably achieving the highest Roman military honour of killing an enemy king.  Crassus senior was embroiled in a scandal when he was accused of getting too familiar with a Vestal virgin, one Licinia.  Crassus was acquitted, though, on the grounds that really he had only been interested in getting a lower property price for one of his development schemes and, as Plutarch put it, his reputation for respectability was saved by his reputation for avarice.  He was not known as a mean man, rather, he was known as generous to his friends and his popularity with the people not only came from his offers of free parties and grain but also his polite manner and lack of snobbery.  Crassus was also a good orator, no doubt a skill he honed via his many court cases and helped by his love of philosophy.  Plutarch mentions that even Cicero would think twice before engaging in legal argument with Crassus.  Remove Ads Advertisement The Spartacus Rebellion According to Plutarch, Crassus accumulated the vast sum of 7,100 talents.  The slave rebellion of the early 70s BCE led by Spartacus, the Thracian gladiator, would present Crassus, made praetor in 73 BCE, with an opportunity to flex his military muscle and gain further prestige with the Roman people.  The slave army, numbering between 70,000 and 120,000, was a serious threat and had already defeated two separate Roman armies and two consuls.  Now they were ravaging the southern Italian countryside and it was Crassus who was entrusted with finally removing this thorn from Rome's heel.  In 71 BCE he unsuccessfully attempted to corner Spartacus in Bruttium where his lieutenant Mummius rashly disregarded Crassus' orders and openly attacked the slave army with two legions, was routed and even forced to abandon arms.  In response to this setback Crassus employed the ancient punishment of decimation on a 500-man section of Mummius' force, where one in ten legionaries were killed by their fellows in full view of the whole army.  With eight legions at his disposal Crassus cornered Spartacus at Lucania, finally defeated the slave army, and crucified 6,000 of the survivors along the Appian Way.  However, some of the prestige for suppressing the slave rebellion was also claimed by Crassus' great rival Pompey who, returning from Spain, mopped up those slaves who had escaped the battle.  Further, back in Rome, it was Pompey who was given the honour of a triumph (in recognition of his other military successes) whilst Crassus was given the lesser ovation.  Splashing his cash, though, Crassus won favour by hosting a long round of lavish celebratory feasts for the people of Rome and in response to Pompey's popular title of 'Great', Crassus would ask dismissively 'Why, how big is he?'

Marcus Licinius Crassus, Louvre Carole Raddato (CC BY-SA) Political Manoeuvres - The Triumvirate Settling their differences following the Spartacus episode, Pompey and Crassus pressurised the Senate and were made consuls in 70 BCE, an opportunity Crassus made full use of to further increase his wealth and influence.  The pair overhauled Rome's political structure, overturning Sulla's constitution and expelling 64 senators.  Politically, though, Crassus again lost ground to Pompey following the latter's string of military victories, notably his spectacular eradication of the Mediterranean pirates in just three months and the swift defeat Mithridates VI in the East.  Made censor in 65 BCE, Crassus' two most significant policies of granting citizenship to the Transpadanes (in the part of Cisalpine Gaul north of the river Po) and annexing Egypt both failed and he was forced to resign from the position.  Also, his backing of Catiline failed to secure this dangerous and unscrupulous schemer the consulship of 65 or 64 BCE and the Senate, instead, went for the more conservative Cicero.  According to Suetonius in his biography of Caesar and a lost work by Cicero (quoted in secondary sources), Crassus had actually planned in 65 BCE, in collusion with Caesar, Publius Sulla and Lucius Autronius, to make himself dictator by purging the Senate of opposition but the conspirators inexplicably lost their nerve at the last moment.  The story is rejected as a fiction by most modern scholars.  Remove Ads Advertisement Crassus continued to pull strings behind the political scenes, largely functioning as a patron of younger men such as Julius Caesar, whose debts Crassus guaranteed in 62 BCE.  Caesar also persuaded Crassus to settle his differences with Pompey so that both would support Caesar's bid to become consul, which he achieved in 59 BCE.  In return, Caesar passed a law which cancelled one third of the money owed by public contractors (publicani) in Asia, a move which further increased Crassus' now legendary personal fortune.  According to Plutarch, Crassus had accumulated the vast sum of 7,100 talents, had extensive real estate interests, owned silver mines, possessed a huge number of slaves, and, of course, he was able to fund his own army.  The three men now formed an open alliance known as the First Triumvirate but it was at times an uneasy one.  When Caesar left for Gaul, Crassus found a new protege in P.  Clodius Pulcher but he turned out to be a dangerous and unreliable ally.  In 56 BCE Crassus did warn Caesar that Cicero planned to politically isolate him from Crassus and Pompey.  To reinforce their alliance, Crassus met Caesar at Ravenna and then all three met together at Luca.  The plan was for Crassus and Pompey to be made consuls once more with the former given a 5-year command in Syria and the latter given the same position in Spain.  In turn, they would both call for a renewal of Caesar's command allowing him another 5-year term as governor in Gaul and the consequent opportunity to expand his army.  All going according to plan, Crassus left for Syria in 55 BCE where he was set on a lucrative invasion of Parthia.  Disaster in Parthia Crassus' initial stay in Syria proved successful as he extorted enormous riches from the local population and won several military victories in 54 BCE.  Crossing the Euphrates in 53 BCE, and accompanied by his son P.  Licinius Crassus as a cavalry commander, the elder Crassus was confident of more success.  However, already deserted by the Armenian king Artavasdes II and having lost his son in an overly-aggressive earlier attack, Crassus himself was defeated near Carrhae.  Without sufficient cavalry and logistical support, hampered by the campaign's lack of planning in the harsh desert terrain, and suffering a little local treachery, the legions were unable to adequately face the 10,000 skilled mounted archers of Orodes II, the Parthian king.  Consequently, the Romans were encircled, trapped and forced to surrender arms and their Eagle standards (a point which would rankle with Rome until their retrieval by Augustus).  According to legend, Crassus was captured alive and killed by having molten gold poured down his throat, symbolic of his unquenchable thirst for wealth.  Remove Ads Advertisement With the removal of Crassus from the political game to control Rome, Pompey and Caesar were left to fight out a bloody civil war which would lay the foundations for a complete overhaul of Roman politics and, ultimately, open the doors to dictatorship and the Imperial age.  Conclusion Crassus was one of the old school politicians of Republican Rome.  Hugely successful in his early years and acquiring vast wealth, he was, perhaps, left behind the times when Rome edged towards the new era of Imperial politics and a time when military prowess and might came to count far more than mastery of politics.  Unable to match the victories of Pompey and Julius Caesar, Crassus died in his attempt to conquer Parthia, in what was his last and fateful throw of the political dice. ", "article_3": "Return to Gold At age sixty, Marcus Licinius Crassus was the oldest member of the first triumvirate and the wealthiest, having made his fortune in slaves and the acquisition of property, either from proscribed citizens or, owning a brigade to fight fires, distraught owners whose houses were burning.  Yet, his vexation that he was less esteemed than his rivals Pompey and Caesar was mollified only when the governorship of Syria fell to him in 55 BC.  Now, relates Plutarch in his Life of Crassus, \"he would not consider Syria nor even Parthia as the boundaries of his success\" (XVI. 2).  In 53 BC, Crassus bridged the Euphrates and attacked the Parthians, even though \"He had no complaint to bring against them nor had the war been assigned to him; but he heard that they were exceedingly wealthy and expected that Orodes would be easy to capture\" (Dio, XL. 12).  But then, after this initial foray, he withdrew to winter quarters in Syria in preparation for the next campaign.  Asked by the Parthian ambassador the reason for this unprovoked war, Crassus boasted that he would tell him in Seleucia, the western capital of the empire, to which the envoy \"burst out laughing and said, pointing to the palm of his upturned hand: 'O Crassus, hair will grow there before thou shalt see Seleucia'\" (Plutarch, Life of Crassus, XVIII. 2; Dio, XL. 16).  Instead of approaching Seleucia by way of the Tigris river, where supplies could be provided by boat, Crassus allowed himself to be treacherously guided into the desert in pursuit of the Parthian general Surenas and was surrounded by his cavalry at the Battle of Carrhae.  The confined soldiers were showered with volleys of arrows \"which fractured armour, and tore their way through every covering alike, whether hard or soft\" (Plutarch, XXIV. 4).  Crassus, himself, was killed when he was enticed to parlay with Surenas, his head and hand sent to Orodes II, where, relates Plutarch (XXXIII), the head was held up by an actor as Euripedes' Bacchae was being performed before the king.  Dio relates a different end, although equally inglorious.  \"And the Parthians, as some say, poured molten gold into his mouth in mockery; for though a man of vast wealth, he had set so great store by money as to pity those who could not support an enrolled legion from their own means, regarding them as poor men\" (XL. 27).  In the Attic Nights (III. 9), Aulus Gellius relates the curious story of the Seian Horse, which signified a possession that invariably brings bad luck. ", "article_4": "REG [at a meeting of the Peoples Front of Judea]: All right, but apart from the sanitation, the medicine, education, wine, public order, irrigation, roads, the fresh water system, and public health, what have the Romans ever done for us? ATTENDEE: Brought peace? --\"Monty Pythons Life of Brian. \" Illustration by Tom Bachtell One of the most successful politicians of the first century before the Christian era was Marcus Licinius Crassus, who was reputedly not only the richest man in Rome but also, by one accounting, the eighth-richest man who has ever lived.  His fortune was pegged (by Pliny the Elder) at upward of two hundred million sesterces.  Most of those millions were in real estate, some of it acquired in a manner strikingly like the operations of health-insurance companies a couple of millennia later.  Crassus had his own private fire department, and if your house caught fire his representatives would offer to buy it on the spot, at a one-time-only, fire-sale price that would fall rapidly as the flames climbed.  If you said yes, youd get a few sesterces, after which Crassus firefighters would do their thing.  If you said no, youd end up with a pile of ashes.  (No public option being available, few owners were in a position to quibble. ) \"Rome had in very truth become the city where everything was for sale,\" the classicist Edith Hamilton wrote.  Crassus eagerly deployed his wealth in the service of his political ambitions.  He funded charitable enterprises, used interest-free loans to put influential citizens in his debt, provided the less affluent with sustenance, and peopled his payroll with the best political operatives money could buy.  He eventually got himself elected consul, the citys highest office, in which, the chroniclers tell us, he did a perfectly adequate job.  Crassus may not have had Pompeys military genius or Caesars supreme eloquence, but he was not without political talent.  According to Plutarch, Romans \"looked upon him as a diligent and careful man, ready to help and succor his fellow-citizens.  Besides, the people were pleased with his courteous and unpretending salutations and greetings, for he never met any citizen, however humble and low, but he returned him his salute by name. \" On the other hand, the great historian notes, \"the many virtues of Crassus were darkened by the one vice of avarice. \" But without the avarice he wouldnt have had the money, and without the money he wouldnt have had the consulship.  Or a prime spot in \"Plutarchs Lives. \" Even by the differing standards of their respective eras, Michael Bloomberg is a nicer guy than Marcus Crassus.  Its hard to imagine Mayor Mike crucifying six thousand miscreants up and down the length of Broadway, as his Roman counterpart did to Spartacus defeated rebels along the Via Appia.  But theres no denying that our esteemed mayor (and he is esteemed) is a very rich man who is where he has been for the past eight years, and where he will remain for the next four--City Hall--because, like Crassus, hes as rich as Croesus.  How rich? Well, according to the latest Forbes 400 list, Michael Bloombergs net worth is $17. 5 billion.  Thats shorthand for seventeen thousand five hundred million dollars.  Thats a stack of hundred-dollar bills twelve miles high.  \"What the labor--relations board doesnt know wont hurt it. \" Facebook Twitter Email Shopping Bloomberg isnt the eighth-richest man who ever lived--just the eighth-richest American alive right now, Forbes reckons--but he is by far the richest person in the city he governs.  The Times reports that he will have personally spent well over a hundred million dollars getting reelected this year, noting, \"He has now spent more of his own money than any other individual in United States history in the pursuit of public office. \" But even thats not the bottom line, not really.  Bloomberg isnt just the citys biggest getter; hes also the citys--and the nations--biggest giver.  Last year, he showered two hundred and thirty-five million dollars in cash on organizations that do all kinds of good works in fields like health, education, and the arts.  Good works are a good thing.  When it comes to political power, though, Bloombergs giving has been a powerful strategic asset to Bloombergs getting.  Five hundred-plus of the twelve hundred-plus recipients of the Mayors personal largesse are based in the city.  The world of nonprofits and charity dinners and patronage of the arts includes a large swath of the citys power elite.  One may note that the Mayor had the support, tacit or open, of that elite when he contrived to overturn the law, twice approved by the voters, that would have barred him from a third term.  One may also note that he enjoys similar support from the citys most prominent black pastors, whose churches and causes benefit from what the Times calls his \"unusual combination of city money, private philanthropy, political appointments and personal attention,\" even though his opponent (for the record, that would be the current city comptroller, Bill Thompson) is African-American.  In broad outline, New Yorkers know all this.  We know that were bought and paid for.  We know that there is something unseemly, even humiliating, about submitting ourselves to be ruled by the richest man in town.  We know that the muscling aside of term limits, whatever the laws merits, was a travesty.  We know that the Mayors campaign this time has been puzzlingly, pettily negative.  Yet we will, most of us, troop to the polls on Tuesday and pull the lever for Mayor Mike.  The truth is that Michael Bloomberg has been a very good mayor.  The record is mixed, of course, but the mixture is largely positive.  Crime is down.  Public education is better, owing mainly to the Mayors takeover of the system.  The racial rancor of Giuliani Time is gone.  People are healthier and longer-lived, and it would be rash to suggest that the Mayors nanny-state initiatives--his smoking bans, his banishment of trans fats, his posted calorie counts--have had nothing to do with this happy development.  He has fought the good fight for congestion pricing and gun control.  His plans for a West Side football coliseum were thwarted, thank God, and his new stadiums for the Yankees and the Mets cost the city a bundle and are unfriendly to fans of modest means, but his bike lanes are terrific and his transformation of Times Square into a peoples piazza was visionary, fun, and cheap.  The Mayor has ruled us well, but he has infantilized us.  We are a little too much like the passive Romans of Crassus day, when the institutions of the old republic were giving way to a despotic (and competent) imperium.  \"People got used to the idea of them,\" Edith Hamilton wrote of Crassus and his fellow-triumvirs, Pompey and Caesar, \"and when four years later their powerful organization was completed and they began to act openly, honored and honorable patriots could find excellent reasons for acquiescing in their running the city.  Indeed, it seemed exceedingly probable that if they did not do so there would be nobody to run it. \" If Bloomberg had been satisfied with two terms, he would be leaving office a beloved legend, a municipal god.  Hell get his third, but well give it to him sullenly, knowing that while it probably wont measure up to his first two--times are hard, huge budget gaps are at hand--itll probably be good enough.  The Pax Bloombergiana will endure a while longer.  But then what? Will we have forgotten how to govern ourselves?", "article_5": "The death of Crassus (Marcus Licinius Crassus) is a classic Roman object lesson in greed.  Crassus was a wealthy Roman businessman of the first century BCE, and one of the three Romans who made up the first Triumvirate, along with Pompey and Julius Caesar.  His death was an ignominious failure, he and his son and most of his army slaughtered by the Parthians at the Battle of Carrhae.  The cognomen Crassus means roughly \"stupid, greedy, and fat\" in Latin, and in the aftermath of his death, he was vilified as a stupid, greedy man whose fatal flaw led to public and private disaster.  Plutarch describes him as an avaricious man, stating that Crassus and his men died as a result of his single-minded pursuit of wealth in central Asia.  His folly not only killed his army but destroyed the triumvirate and demolished any hope of future diplomatic relations between Rome and Parthia.  Leaving Rome In the mid-first century BCE, Crassus was the proconsul of Syria, and as a result, he had become enormously wealthy.  According to several sources, in 53 BCE, Crassus proposed that he act as general to wage a military campaign against the Parthians (modern Turkey).  He was sixty years old, and it had been 20 years since he had participated in a battle.  There was no very good reason to attack the Parthians who had not attacked the Romans: Crassus was primarily interested in gaining the wealth of Parthia, and his colleagues in the Senate hated the idea.  Efforts to stop Crassus included the formal announcement of bad omens by several tribunes, particularly C.  Ateius Capito.  Ateius went so far as to attempt to have Crassus arrested, but the other tribunes stopped him.  Finally, Ateius stood at the gates of Rome and performed a ritual curse against Crassus.  Crassus ignored all these warnings and set out on the campaign which was to end with the loss of his own life, as well as a large part of his army and his son Publius Crassus.  Death in the Battle of Carrhae As he prepared to go to war against Parthia, Crassus turned down the offer of 40,000 men from the king of Armenia if he would cross the Armenian lands.  Instead, Crassus chose to cross the Euphrates and travel overland to Carrhae (Harran in Turkey), on the advice of a treacherous Arab chief called Ariamnes.  There he engaged in battle with the numerically inferior Parthians, and his infantry found they were no match for the barrage of arrows fired by the Parthians.  Crassus ignored advice to reconsider his tactics, preferring to wait until the Parthians ran out of ammunition.  That didn't happen, in part because his enemy used the \"Parthian shot\" tactic, of turning around in their saddles and firing arrows while riding away from the battle.  Crassus' men finally demanded that he negotiate an end to the battle with the Parthians, and he headed off to the meeting with the general Surena.  The parley went awry, and Crassus and all of his officers were killed.  Crassus died in a scuffle, possibly killed by Pomaxathres.  Seven Roman eagles were also lost to the Parthians, a great humiliation to Rome, making this a defeat on the order of Teutoberg and Allia.  Mockery and Outcome Although none of the Roman sources could have seen how Crassus died and how his body was treated after death, a rich set of myths are written about that.  One myth said the Parthians poured molten gold into his mouth, to show the futility of greed.  Others say the general's body remained unburied, cast among the undistinguished heaps of corpses to be torn apart by birds and beasts.  Plutarch reported that the winning general, the Parthian Surena, sent Crassus' body to the Parthian King Hyrodes.  At a wedding party of Hyrodes' son, Crassus's head was used as a prop in a performance of Euripides' \"The Bacchae. \" Over time, the myth grew and was elaborated, and the upshot of the gory details was the death of any possibility of diplomatic reconciliation with Parthia for the next two centuries.  The Triumvirate of Crassus, Caesar, and Pompey was dissolved, and without Crassus, Caesar and Pompey met in battle at the Battle of Pharsalus after crossing the Rubicon.  As Plutarch says: \"before he went upon his Parthian expedition, [Crassus] found his possessions to amount to seven thousand one hundred talents; most of which, if we may scandal him with a truth, he got by fire and rapine, making his advantages of the public calamities. \" He died in pursuit of wealth from Asia.

His career was nothing short of stellar.  Through his military exploits, shrewd and often morally dubious entrepreneurship, and a vast network of patronage Crassus was able to climb to the top of the Roman political hierarchy.  His wealth and influence made Crassus one of the three pillars of the First Triumvirate along with Caesar and Pompei.  However, his fateful quest for prestige in the East not only resulted in his demise but also undermined the very foundation of the Republic, setting off a chain of events that would eventually result in its collapse.  Marcus Licinius Crassus \"Humble\" Beginnings Bust of Marcus Licinius Crassus, 1st century AD, Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, Copenhagen, via ancientrome. ru Marcus Licinius Crassus was born in 115 BC, in the Roman province of Iberia (modern-day Spain).  According to the first-century historian Plutarch, the Crassus family was not excessively wealthy, and the young boy grew up in relatively modest surroundings.  Plutarch might be right, as Crassus family could not measure up to the prestigious patrician lineages such as gens Julia or Aemilia.  Crassus father, Publius Licinius Crassus, was of a humble plebeian background.  But it would be wrong to consider the future triumvir a simple man with no connections.  Crassus senior was a consul in 97 BC, held a military command and in 93 BC was given a rare honor - a triumph.  This series of events produced a perfect setting to \"nurture\" an ambitious Roman aristocrat.  Alas, in 83 BC, Crassus senior died during the political struggle that would define the future of the Roman Republic.  Publius chose poorly and backed Lucius Cornelius Sulla in his struggle against Gaius Marius.  With his political patron defeated, Crassus senior disappeared from history.  He was either killed in the purges or committed suicide.  Young Crassus fate would have been equally grim had he not fled to Spain.  Building A Fortune An insula, late 2nd - early 3rd century, Roman port of Ostia, via Ostia Antica The relative security of Spain, separated by the sea from the battlegrounds of Italy, not only allowed Crassus to survive but to flourish.  It was in Spain that Marcus Licinius Crassus would begin his rise to power.  Using the wealth of his estate, and the family connections, he started to build an army for Sulla.  It was this army that would play a crucial part in bringing the civil war between Marius and Sulla to a close.  With Sulla triumphant, Crassus could finally share in his patrons glory.  More importantly, Crassus got an opportunity to vastly increase his personal wealth, being the recipient of the assets taken from the victims of Sullas proscriptions.  Are you enjoying this article?

Those confiscated assets became the core of his real-estate empire, built in the years following the war.  High-value properties acquired in the aftermath of the war were sold for a bargain price to Crassus allies, solidifying his political ties with the most affluent men of the Republic.  It also provided him with a capital, which he invested in one of the most morally dubious enterprises in Rome: real-estate management.  By the time of Crassuss rise, Rome had become the most important city in the Mediterranean.  The growth of the Republics capital was accompanied by the ever-increasing influx of new inhabitants, coming in search of jobs and a better life.  To accommodate all the newcomers, cheap multi-story residential buildings (insulae) were built.  As with everything mass-constructed, the insulae were of poor quality, prone to collapse, and more importantly, a fire hazard.  According to Plutarch, Crassus paid special attention to fire-damaged buildings that he would buy for a bargain from their terrified owners.  Once in possession of the real estate, he would rebuild it using his slave workforce and then rent and sell it for greater profit.  In such a way Marcus Licinius Crassus soon acquired a large part of Rome.  Crassus And Spartacus Mosaic showing a fight between the gladiators Astyanax and Kalendio, 3rd century AD, National Archaeological Museum, Madrid Aside from the real-estate business, Crassus enjoyed another valuable commodity of the period - slaves.  Considered more valuable than mines or agrarian lands (which he also owned), slaves were the lifeblood that kept the Republic alive.  They fulfilled various duties: they could work as hard laborers or be used as teachers, doctors, stewards, or architects.  Although certain high-profile individuals were treated rather well (some of them better than low-class freemen), for most of the workforce life was relentlessly harsh.  This social injustice led to several slave revolts.  But no revolt was as serious and dangerous as the revolt of Spartacus in 73 BC.  A former gladiator, Spartacus was able to exploit the absence of the Roman legions, which were occupied elsewhere.  Following a series of Roman defeats at the hands of Spartacus and his growing army, the Senate appointed Marcus Licinius Crassus to tackle this military and political crisis that was spinning out of control.  Recognizing this rare opportunity, Crassus amassed a large force of 10 legions, taking personal command.  This was a calculated risk, as the victory over Spartacus in 71 BC brought him the much-desired military prestige.  Although Crassus defeated Spartacus on the field of battle and saved Italy, he was not awarded a coveted triumph.  Instead, the Senate honored him with a lesser celebration - an ovatio.  The triumph went to a man who gave the revolt a final blow - Pompey.  The Benefactor Of The Republic The Rostra, from where orator would address the people, Foro Romano, Rome, via Digitales Forum Romanum For a Roman, to be a wealthy man or a competent general was not enough.  Those qualities were more than welcome, but a model Roman aristocrat had to be above all an educated man, and a fine orator.  Marcus Licinius Crassus was not an exception.  A charismatic speaker, Crassus knew how to approach common people, using a portion of his wealth to improve the lives of Romes citizens.  Besides providing grain to the citizens of Rome, he funded temples, keeping a good relationship with priests and their gods.  This was not done out of sheer generosity.  Like any other Roman politician, Crassus depended on the will of the people.  If he kept the populus happy and satisfied, in return he could count on their support.  The same applied to his fellow aristocrats.  Roman political life was a complex labyrinth.  To reach the top of this political hierarchy, and to remain in that place, the rich and powerful had to keep a number of clients who depended on their patron.  Supporting a promising client and helping him reach a powerful position could enhance a patrons status and allow him to collect favors later.  Sometimes, the result of such a relationship could be a formidable alliance.  This is exactly what happened between Crassus and Julius Caesar.  Recognizing his potential, Crassus paid Caesars debts and took the young man under his wings to groom him.  His calculation paid off since Caesar would later use his influence to boost the political career of his mentor.  The Road To Triumvirate Vignette with profiles of the three Triumvirs, Raphael Morghen after Giovanni Battista Mengardi, 1791-94, The British Museum, London The mentorship of Julius Caesar resulted in a lifelong friendship between the two powerful men.  However, in Roman political life, not everyone could be a friend.  The roots of Crassus rivalry with Pompey went back to the Spartacus revolt when it was Pompey, and not Crassus, who was given the honor of a triumph.  Determined not to be outmaneuvered again, Crassus used his most important asset, his vast fortune, and hosted several large feasts to win the favor of the populace.  Crassus was able to cash in his military victory and, thus, held the consulship together with Pompey in 70 BC.  Surprisingly, the two rivals found a common ground and reshaped the political structure of Rome together.  Despite his wealth and status, Crassus was unable to impose his will on the Senate.  His reforms were rejected, and his attempt to secure the consulship for his protege, notorious senator Catiline, failed.  To make matters worse, while Crassus was suffering political defeats, his rival Pompey was gaining military accolades.  Fresh from his spectacular elimination of Mediterranean piracy, Pompey achieved a swift victory over the Pontic kingdom in the East.  It would be Crassus erstwhile pupil that would bring two rivals together.  Recognizing the potential of pulling their resources, Caesar approached the two men in 60 BC.  The result was an open alliance known as the First Triumvirate, which allowed the three grandees to take joint control of the state.  The alliance was an uneasy one, but it gave Crassus the much-wanted opportunity to rule.  The opportunity that would eventually lead him to his doom.  The Fateful Expedition And Crassus Death Coin issued during the governorship of Marcus Licinius Crassus in Syria, 54 BC, via vcoins. com Through the influence of the Triumvirate, its three members were given three respective commands.  While Caesar got Gaul, and Pompey got Spain, Crassus got the most prestigious of them all.  In 55 BC, Crassus was sent to the East, to Syria, the freshly annexed province bordering the powerful kingdom of Parthia.  From Romes perspective, the East was more developed, more prosperous, and thus more attractive than any Western province.  The region was filled with cities, linked by a vast road network, and rich in resources.  This made it an attractive target for a potential Roman invasion.  And starting with Crassus, the vaunted East became a place of doom for many Roman rulers and commanders.  For Marcus Licinius Crassus, the first year in Syria proved to be a lucrative one.  He was able to acquire the vast wealth of the region and, what is more important, achieved several military victories.  It is difficult to say if those initial successes encouraged Crassus to embark on his fateful adventure, or if the powerful Roman planned to cross the Euphrates from the very beginning.  In 53 BC, Crassus legions crossed into the territory of the Parthian kingdom.  The Death of Marcus Licinius Crassus, Lancelot Blondeel, 16th century, Groeninge Museum, Bruges Was it hubris, an attempt to secure a rapid victory, or was it a result of a wrong assessment? It is difficult to say.  What is known, is that Crassus expedition was doomed to failure from the very onset.  Lacking the cavalry to counter the mighty Parthian cataphracts and mounted archers, the Roman army found itself under constant attack and with no supplies incoming.  Considering the harsh conditions of the desert, the expedition could not stand a chance.  Losing his son in the initial attack, Crassus was forced to give a battle near Carrhae (modern-day Harran in Turkey).  His army was encircled, decimated, and forced to surrender.  The final blow to the pursuer of military glory was the loss of the eagle standards (they would be retrieved decades later by Augustus).  The reckless commander, Marcus Licinius Crassus, fell into captivity and was killed by a Parthian general.  The infamous story of Crassus being executed by having molten gold poured down his throat is probably a rumor.  But it could have been a fitting end for Romes wealthiest man.  The Legacy Of Marcus Licinius Crassus Crassus sacks the Temple in Jerusalem, Giambattista Pittoni, 1743, Gallerie dellAcademia, Venice Marcus Licinius Crassus was a fascinating man.  The chaos that engulfed the Roman Republic, he saw as an opportunity to amass enormous wealth.  By using shrewd and often morally dubious practices, Crassus became a master of Rome.  A skilled orator and politician, Crassus knew how to approach people, both the populus and the Roman grandees.  When he reached the very top of the socio-political ladder of the fledgling Republic, there was one thing that eluded the man who had it all - military prestige.  The problem was aggravated by the martial accolades of his main rival Pompey, but also the successes of his erstwhile protege Caesar.  Thus, jealousy put Crassus on a path of no return.  The sudden demise of Marcus Licinius Crassus in the East was a blow to Roman prestige.  The emerging world powers ambitions were checked, albeit briefly.  Rome could and would retaliate, and this pattern would repeat many times, centuries after the Crassus death.  What Rome could not do, was to rein in the ambitions of the powerful men.  With Crassus removed from the political arena, his two allies were put on a collision course, which would plunge the Republic into a bloody civil war.  Its outcome would topple down the old order, and usher in the Imperial era.  Instead of being remembered as a successful politician, businessman, and commander, the name of Marcus Licinius Crassus would be immortalized as a synonym for the dangers of unchecked ambition, hubris, and greed.

[citation needed] He then adapted The Bear P. O. V.  (Cesar for Best Director, 1988) in the heart of select locations of the Dolomites, Germany, Canada and Austria.  He then shot in Vietnam the adaptation of Marguerite Duras's autobiographical novel, The Lover (1992), recreating the atmosphere of colonial Indochina.

There he will drive for six hours to Olgii and the set of his new film, a 1960s-set steppes epic.  It's a monthly commute, one the 69-year-old has been making for three years since he started pre-production on the film, likely to be finished next year (\"No fatigue! It's like love! You climb mountains, you cross oceans\").  When he arrives, there will be no need to freshen up: a 75lb wolf will lacquer him in saliva the second he steps from the car.  This is Cloudy, one-time alpha male of the 30-strong pack.  \"We have a very extraordinary relationship,\" says Annaud, face full of affection.  \"With the new king, Parker, there is not the same love. \" Last week they were shooting a scene which required a wolf in a hole.  The task, naturally, fell to Parker.  \"But he was very frightened.  And all the other wolves were thinking: 'Is our new king weak or brave?' The prime minister [Parker's deputy] offered to go first, but after much hesitation he got into the hole, peed in it and got out, very proud.  All the courtiers were licking his face.  Cloudy was witnessing the circus and I could see him thinking: 'Yeah.  I've been there.  Don't trust them! Next day they will kill you. '\" He grins at the brutality.  \"This is their strength! This is why a pack of five will decimate 1,000 sheep.  When a new guy comes to the king to challenge him he ends up either dead or the new king.  And the former has one leg left.  It is the same in Cannes. \" He gestures round the dining room of the Majestic hotel: \"A cruel and fragile world of ambition.  Where your fate can be decided in a few seconds.  You get thousands of lickings and then you lose a leg. \" Secret malice aside, Annaud is a classic wolf in sheep's clothing.  He bleats sweetly and softly; the friendliest of men, topped with a shaggy fleece of silver curls.  He conducts himself with such charm and delicacy, you can't imagine him baring fangs.  But he would hate to be mistaken for livestock.  \"There are some jobs - like a civil servant - where your life is not in danger every minute.  You'll never get the lickings or the fights.  Wolves have to fight for their lives every day.  It's the life of a warrior.  People who choose film are in danger every day.  Otherwise your life is eating, sleeping, getting fat and being eaten. \" He doesn't weary of the lupine lifestyle? \"No.  I know that people who smile also have a knife at their back.  When you experience success you become a public enemy; when it's failure you give people so much pleasure.  It's sort of sad at first and then you see it's the rule of life.  I love it, it's my world.  But yes, if my movie gets a bad review my friends are very happy and they're still my friends.  This is human. \" That's the thing about Annaud: he's a beast with battle scars, a wolf who knows how it feels to be a sacrificial lamb.  He won an Oscar for his first film, Black and White in Colour, shot in west Africa in 1976, then flip-flopped round the globe and between epochs with Quest for Fire (1981), The Name of the Rose (1986), The Bear (1988), The Lover (1991), Enemy at the Gates (2001) and Black Gold (2011).  But it was his 1997 film, Seven Years in Tibet, starring Brad Pitt as a real-life Austrian mountaineer who befriended the young Dalai Lama, which became both his most successful (taking $131m worldwide) and most contentious.  The Chinese authorities issued Arnaud with a permanent ban on entering the country.  He was shocked, upset.  He repented and, somehow, succeeded so much he's gone from persona non grata to adopted son, entrusted with China's most heartfelt homegrown movie yet.  Brad Pitt as Heinrich Harrer in Seven Years in Tibet, the film that caused Annaud to be barred from entering China.  Photograph: David Appleby/AP Wolf Totem (budget $32m) is based on a 2004 novel by Lu Jiamin, which sold over 20m copies and is now the second most-read book in the country (after Mao's Little Red Book).  It's a semi-autobiographical saga about a student from Peking dispatched to Mongolia to teach nomadic shepherds, who share a deep bond with wolves the government wants to cull.  But the student succumbs to the way of the wolf, too; the book is half Confucian critique, half ecological call-to-arms.  Today, Annaud is especially fired by these themes (\"I feel very honoured to help try stop the degradation of the world\"), but it is the \"soul-brotherhood\" he feels with Lu that was the real clincher, he thinks.  Lu went to Mongolia in 1969, the same year Annaud was sent to teach film in Cameroon as part of his military service.  Arrnaud says the key tension in his films is between his Western intellectual origins and the emotional life of nature.  \"I do the same movie over and over.  I hide it - I change period, location, hero. \" Still, though, I'm slightly baffled.  There was a long search for a director, after all - initially they'd been hoping to release in time for the Beijing Olympics.  Why him? \"They said a Chinese director can't say these things; that it's too sensitive.  They didn't want an American.  I'm sort of neutral.  And I have made a lot of films with animals. \" There's something more, too; I think it's contrition.  \"I offended China with Seven Years and it's quite something that after this we have decided not to speak about it.  I'm very grateful; it says a lot about China today. \" Yet it must be strange to be working in a country in which he is unable to discuss a piece of work in which he invested so much? Annaud ducks.  We place too much emphasis on verbal communication, he says, both on and off screen.  If your heart is true, that shines through.  \"Movies that are built on dialogue are TV shows.  Or radio shows on which you have a camera that shows the person who speaks.  Film was created silent and the good ones didn't even inter-titles.  \"When there is empathy you don't need language.  So many successful couples don't speak the same language.  In Africa I spent four hours driving in the forest with the tribe chief.  We didn't share a language.  And I loved him.  I understood him better than I did my friends at film school. \" But surely without words there's a lot of projection? That's OK, thinks Annaud.  It's all about the core feeling.  \"The rest is detail, furnishings. \" Shooting with people who don't speak French or English forces him to focus on essentials.  He prefers the mood, too, anyway, in the east.  \"When I go to Paris my heart sinks.  I feel people aren't happy.  They understand that their country is not what it was; that the lives of their children are not going to be as good as theirs.  China is just the opposite.  We still have a vision of China as very rigid, with officials who are like puppets.  It's just the opposite! Under the uniform they are living creatures, full of joy! The new China is like Spain after Franco.  Or America in the 1970s.  People know they are going to run the world. \" He's nearly at the bottom of his coffee cup.  We talk about animals some more.  I'm surprised when he insists they feel glee.  \"Of course! When they see that the big male who's been giving them shit for a few years now is limping at the back and begging for food. \" How can he tell? \"The glittering eyes and the behaviour of the neck.  It tells the truth. \" People would rely less on therapy, he thinks, if they could accept their own innate bestiality.  Annaud - the most civilised barbarist - is a good ad for what he advocates.  He felt so happy, he says, reading about pigeons one day and clocking himself in the description.  \"Oh! I'm trying to be big in front of a pigeon female who pretends not to see me.  You feel more humble when you accept this.  OK! I'm just a pigeon!\" He flaps off happily, back to his wolves, tail wagging. ", "article_2": "Jean-Jacques Annaud (born October 1, 1943 in Juvisy-sur-Orge, France) directed French movies like Black and White in Color (1977), Quest For Fire (1982), The Lover (1992) from the 1984 autobiographical novel by Marguerite Duras, English language films like In the Name of the Rose (1986) with Sean Connery from the 1980 novel by Umberto Eco, Seven Years in Tibet (1997) with Brad Pitt from the 1952 memoir by Heinrich Harrer, Enemy at the Gates (2001) with Jude Law and Ralph Fiennes. ", "article_3": "In his 1997 film \"Seven Years in Tibet,\" French director Jean-Jacques Annaud didnt mince words about the Chinese Communist Party.  The based-on-a-true-story movie, starring Brad Pitt as an Austrian mountaineer who befriends the adolescent Dalai Lama in the years before Chinas 1950 invasion of the plateau, ended with several blunt title cards: \"One million Tibetans have died as a result of the Chinese occupation of Tibet.  Six thousand monasteries were destroyed,\" read one.  Said the next: \"In 1959, the Dalai Lama was forced to flee to India.  He still lives there today, trying to promote a peaceful resolution with the Chinese.  In 1989, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. \" The movie so rankled Beijing that not only was the film banned in China but Annaud, Pitt and his costar, David Thewlis, were also declared personae non gratae and unwelcome to enter the country.  And to this day, Beijing continues to be extremely touchy about Tibet and the Dalai Lama (whom they regard as a separatist; China even protested President Obamas recent meeting with the exiled spiritual leader).  Advertisement But somewhat surprisingly, Annauds Chinese exile has ended.  Not only has he been allowed back into the country, but he has made a new film here -- a $40-million, 3-D adaptation of the Chinese novel \"Wolf Totem\" that arrived in mainland theaters just in time for the Chinese New Year holiday last week.  The movie, which has earned $32 million so far, will roll out in France next, and Sony has distribution rights in the United States and a number of other markets.  The story, set during the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s, centers on a young Beijing intellectuals fascination with the wolves he encounters when hes sent to teach Mandarin to minority nomadic herders in the majestic, scenic grasslands of Inner Mongolia.  On one hand, the wildlife drama is a natural for Annaud, who has previously made compelling stars of vicious fauna in his films \"The Bear\" and the tiger story \"Two Brothers. \" But the bleak, semi-autobiographical novel by Jiang Rong -- a democracy activist who was jailed after the Tiananmen Square massacre -- is fraught with potential political tripwires.  Unexpectedly approved by censors, the book, published in 2004, became a bestseller.  The story, in part, is a denunciation of ecologically disastrous government \"modernization\" schemes.  But like \"Seven Years,\" it is also a critique of majority Han Chinese chauvinism vis-a-vis ethnic minorities.  Unlike in Annauds Tibet film, the Communist cadres in \"Wolf\" arent arrogantly stomping on Buddhist mandalas or mowing down monks with firearms.  But when they order the local herdsmen to snatch wolf cubs from their dens and kill them, and foolishly try to introduce farming and industry to the steppe, they hardly come off as benevolent, much less intelligent, leaders.  Annaud said he was as surprised as anyone to be approached by Jiang and a Chinese production team about adapting the book for the big screen.  \"I was aware of the novel and had read some excerpts in the French press.  But I remember saying to myself, this was something Id love to do, but of course its not going to be for me,\" recalled Annuad, 71, who said the book reminded him of his own sojourn in the 1960s as a young man to Cameroon, where he witnessed misguided and destructive agricultural \"development\" programs implemented by French agronomists.  Reminding Jiang and his colleagues of Chinas official reception for \"Seven Years,\" the director said: \"Those charming people just smiled and said, well, we have changed, China has changed.  . . .  We dont know how to do what you do.  Therefore, we need you. \" Annaud said he was never asked to apologize for or renounce \"Seven Years. \" \"This is the -- should I say -- the Oriental politeness: You dont talk about things that may put your partner in an uneasy position,\" Annaud said.  \"So, no, we dont talk about it. \" The director still stands by \"Seven Years,\" adding, diplomatically and carefully, that he sees a common thread between that work and \"Wolf Totem. \" \"I am pleased that I had this positive feeling for this minority of China.  I think the beauty of China . . .  is that it is a country of diverse culture.  I think we all have to learn together and respect each other.  This is one of the messages of this 'Wolf Totem.  It is respecting people who speak a different language and have different ways of living.  It is important for all of us. \" Though \"Wolf\" can certainly be read in a political fashion, it is first and foremost a story of man and nature that required extraordinary preparation and logistical feats starting in 2008.  Actual shooting lasted 160 days over a year and a half, from mid-2012 to late 2013.  The production team spent years finding, raising and training a group of wolves in China under the direction of Canada-based trainer Andrew Simpson.  Annaud said he and his crew drove nearly 25,000 miles in a four-wheel drive searching for the perfect unspoiled landscapes.  But nature didnt always cooperate.  When snow failed to materialize for one epic blizzard scene, the production had to rent 18 large trucks and send them 1,200 miles away to get snow.  In the course of filming, the mercury dipped as low as minus-30 degrees, with winds of 50 mph; his cinematographer lost feeling in his feet and has never recovered.  \"It was madness,\" Annaud said.  A meticulously choreographed seven-minute sequence -- which sees a pack of wolves attacking an equine herd during a night snowstorm -- took six weeks to film using a complex mix of live wolves and horses, puppet animals, drones, cranes, a 500-foot blue screen and CGI.  \"It combined all of the most difficult things -- shooting with animals, shooting at night, shooting in the blizzard, shooting with two species that hate each other.  So that was, on paper, a very complicated scene.  Plus we had to make sure that no animal would get in danger,\" said Annaud, showing off his elaborate storyboards for the sequence.  \"Its exciting because it requires all the tricks in the book.  I love it; its a challenge. \" Post-production movie magic was needed to digitally remove trainers and fences from the shots, but a vast majority of the action is real, enhanced in three dimensions.  \"What I wanted was the real interconnection.  If you put a pack of wolves and a herd of horses running together, you get intense expressions from the wolves.  In their eyes, they are woooo,\" said Annaud, making the sound of a crazed beast.  \"Doing it in the computer gives you a cartoonish emotion.  The goal for me was 98. 5% real shots. \" Asked whether censors insisted he remove anything from the script or the film, Annaud said authorities raised questions about three scenes -- including the killing of the wolf cubs -- but that he was allowed to retain them.  The movie is an official Chinese-French co-production, and its backers have high hopes that visual spectacle and the conservation theme will entice audiences beyond the mainland.  Annaud says previews in France have been enthusiastic but calls the entire endeavor \"a daring experiment. \" \"I found the book very universal,\" says Annaud.  \"It would be great if this story can move people around the world. \" julie. makinen@latimes. com", "article_4": "Highest Rated: 100% Black and White in Color (1976) Lowest Rated: 11% Black Gold (2011) Birthday: Oct 1, 1943 Birthplace: Draveil, Essonne, France Pioneering French director Jean-Jacques Annaud has often seemed as much anthropologist as filmmaker, taking great pains to faithfully create the disparate cultures that have driven his films.

He was a very popular figure on stage, radio and in films, during the 1950s and 1960s. Blanche was born in an artistic family, mainly of stage actors--including his father Louis Blanche--and his uncle, Emmanuel Blanche, who was a painter.  He completed his secondary schooling at fourteen, the youngest in France to do so at the time. In the 1940s and 1950s, Blanche was part of Robert Dhery's theatrical company Les Branquignols, with whom he played in the film Ah! Les belles bacchantes, starring Robert Dhery, Colette Brosset (Dhery's then-wife), and Louis de Funes; directed by Jean Loubignac in 1954. [citation needed] Blanche teamed up with Pierre Dac to form a comic duo best remembered for Le Sar Rabindranath Duval, a sketch about a phony and nonsensical Indian clairvoyant and guru (1957).  They also created a popular and equally nonsensical radiophonic series, loosely based on a highly improbable espionage and conspiration plot, Malheur aux barbus, which was broadcast on Paris Inter in 213 episodes from 1951 to 1952.  The same plot and characters were revived on Europe 1 in a series called Signe Furax, enjoying no less than 1,034 daily episodes between 1956 and 1960.  Both broadcasts were phenomenal audience successes in the pre-television era. [citation needed] Blanche was also renowned for broadcasting phone pranks, in which he entertained listeners by making the most improbable situations sound plausible. [citation needed] He wrote poems, and the lyrics of 673 songs. [citation needed] On stage, he acted in Tartuffe and Neron and, in 1955, Chevalier du Ciel, an operetta by Luis Mariano at the Gaite-Lyrique theatre. [citation needed] Blanche also enjoyed a successful cinematographic career, both as an actor and scriptwriter.  He appeared as a hard-headed German colonel (\"Obersturmfuhrer Schulz\") opposite Brigitte Bardot in Babette s'en va-t-en guerre (1959).  He was one of the favourite actors of French filmmaker Georges Lautner, and played Maitre Folace (a shady solicitor counselling a colourful gangster mob) in Les Tontons flingueurs (1963).  Blanche also appeared in Boris Vassilief's Les Barbouzes (1964). [citation needed] He delighted in parodying classical music, adapting famous works such as Schubert's \"Die Forelle\" (The Trout) into a crazy and slightly risque piece about a 16-year-old romantic girl obsessed with Schubert's song to the point of giving birth to a live trout while performing it on her piano.  Similarly, he turned Beethoven's 5th Symphony into a lengthy and quite repetitive musical glorification of the clothes peg and its fictitious inventor, Jeremie-Victor Opdebec. Blanche died at the age of 52, from a heart attack with a background of untreated Type 1 diabetes. [citation needed] He is buried in Eze cemetery.

Earlier in his career, Bertrand was Minister of Health from 2005 to 2007 in Dominique de Villepin's government under President Jacques Chirac, then served as Minister of Labour, Social Affairs and Solidarity from 2007 to 2009 and as Minister of Labour, Employment and Health from 2010 to 2012. He played a leading role in Nicolas Sarkozy's presidential campaign in 2007.  He was a member of Union for a Popular Movement, later The Republicans, until 11 December 2017, when he announced that was \"definitively leaving\" the party after Laurent Wauquiez was elected the leader of the party. Bertrand was born on 21 March 1965 in Chalons-sur-Marne, in the Marne departement, of the Champagne-Ardenne region of France.  He studied at the University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne, where he obtained a master's degree in public law, then a Diplome d'Etudes Superieures Specialisees (DESS) in local administration.  Bertrand began his professional life as an insurance agent. Early beginnings  At the age of sixteen, Bertrand volunteered for the Rally for the Republic (RPR) and quickly went into politics.  In 1992, Bertrand led the campaign for the 'no' to the Maastricht Treaty in his department, the Aisne in the region of Picardy.  He was at the time assistant to the mayor of Saint-Quentin, Aisne.  He was one of the pioneers of the 'Saint-Quentin beach', an event similar to Paris-Plage.  From 1997 to 2002, he was parliamentary assistant to Jacques Braconnier, Senator for the Aisne, and he was elected to the National Assembly on 16 June 2002 for the 18th legislature (2002-2007), representing the second constituency of the Aisne Department.  In 2003, Alain Juppe, President for the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP), put him in charge of leading the debate and explaining the subject of pensions reform during a \"Tour of France\".  He was chosen to defend this draft bill in the National Assembly.  At the same time he was part of the 'Club de la boussole,' a group of deputies who declared their loyalty to then-President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin. During this period, Bertrand received favourable attention in the right-wing political milieu.  On 31 March 2004, when Raffarin appointed his third government, Bertrand was named Junior Health Minister for Health Insurance.  Under his Senior Minister, Philippe Douste-Blazy, he led the reform on health insurance.  Later on, he pronounced himself strongly in favour of a European Constitution for the referendum on 29 May 2005.  After the majority of the French electorate answered \"no\" to the referendum, Raffarin resigned as Prime Minister.  Under his successor Dominique de Villepin, Bertrand became the Senior Minister for Health, when Douste-Blazy was reappointed Foreign Affairs Minister.  His mandate as Health Minister was marked by the chikungunya epidemic and the law against smoking in public places, ratified in 2004.  Bertrand announced his support to UMP presidential candidate Nicolas Sarkozy on 29 September 2006.  He was named Sarkozy's official spokesperson on 15 January 2007.  He quit the government on 26 March to devote himself fully to the campaign.  On 18 May 2007, he was named Minister of Labour, Social Affairs and Solidarity in the Prime Minister Francois Fillon's government.  On 19 June 2007 Bertrand was appointed Minister of Labour, Social Affairs and Solidarity in Fillon's second government after the first one had handed in its resignation the day before.  He later served as Minister of Labour, Employment and Health from 2010 to 2012. Following the 2012 French legislative election, Bertrand announced his candidacy for the post the UMP parliamentary group's chair.  Having been endorsed by Francois Fillon, he lost an internal vote against Christian Jacob. In the 2015 regional elections, Bertrand won over Marine Le Pen and became the president of the Regional Council of Hauts-de-France. Amid the Fillon affair, in March 2017, Bertrand joined Valerie Pecresse, Christian Estrosi and others in calling for Alain Juppe to replace Francois Fillon as the party's candidate in the 2017 French presidential election. In 2020, Bertrand publicly expressed interest in challenging incumbent President Emmanuel Macron in the 2022 French presidential election. By early 2021, Betrand was widely tipped by French and international media to be the center-right's candidate. According to 2021 polls, he would be in 3rd position behind Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen.  At the party's 2021 congress, however, he only came in fourth after Eric Ciotti, Valerie Pecresse and Michel Barnier; he subsequently endorsed Pecresse. In the 2021 regional elections, Bertrand was re-elected.  He obtained 52. 37 percent of the vote in the Hauts-de-France region, against 25. 65 percent for Sebastien Chenu of the National Rally. Domestic policy  Bertrand is considered as representative of France's moderate right. In 2013, Bertrand led a group of fellow UMP politicians who joined forces with Europe Ecology - The Greens in trying to force a constitutional review of a new law introduced by the Socialist Party which expanded government powers to monitor phone and Internet connection data.  However, in a blow to the campaign, UMP parliamentary group leader Christian Jacob later wrote to his colleagues that the group would not seek a legal review. In 2014, Xavier Bertrand advocated a \"rewrite\" or \"repeal\" of the law opening marriage to same-sex couples, indicating to Valeurs actuelles: \"I can't resign myself to seeing the rules of filiation turned upside down to this extent.  I am against adoption by homosexual couples, PMA assisted reproductive technology and of course GPA surrogacy. \" He reiterated his opposition to same-sex marriage in 2017. Ahead of the 2022 elections, Bertrand defends liberal economic positions.  According to Marianne magazine, he intends to position himself on the right of Emmanuel Macron.  In particular, he wants to cut production taxes by half, believing that the measures undertaken in this direction by the government are insufficient.  This project, which would represent a loss of 33 billion euros for the state, would be compensated \"in particular by efforts on public spending\"; it provides for a postponement of two years of the retirement age and a reform of the unemployment insurance system that would result in a tightening of the conditions of compensation for the unemployed. Has also promised the \"re-industrialisation\" of France and quotas on immigration. He has also run on an anti-technocratic message. In July 2014, Bertrand defended President Francois Hollande's decision to push ahead with delivery of a Mistral-class amphibious assault ship to Russia in defiance of calls by key allies, despite the Russo-Ukrainian War; the deal was later called off. During his presidential campaign in 2021, Bertrand argued that France should reassert itself by leaving NATOs integrated command. Bertrand married Emmanuelle Gontier, advisor on human resources, on 11 July 1998.  They have three children, two of whom are twins.  He has been a member of the Grand Orient of France since 1995.", "article_1": "Xavier Bertrand, a one-time insurance salesman from the French provinces, established himself as a leading contender for next years presidential election, after his centre-right bloc out-performed rivals in regional votes at the weekend.  The results shook up the political landscape, turning the 2022 election from what had been seen by many observers as a two-horse race between President Emmanuel Macron and far-right leader Marine Le Pen into a three way contest.

Bertrand, who is derided by some foes as an overweight provincial politician, on Sunday handsomely defeated the far right in the north, a Le Pen stronghold where crime and the decline of local industry top voter concerns, to be re-elected leader of the region.  He said his party provided the strongest bulwark against the far right, earlier proclaiming to have \"smashed the jaws of the Front National\", referring to the old name of Le Pens party often associated with its anti-Semitic, xenophobic past.  An IPSOS/Sopra Steria poll late on Sunday showed Bertrands popularity climbing nationwide.  It projected he would win 18% of the first round presidential vote, up several points on previous polls and narrowing the gap on Macron and Le Pen.  \"Of course there is no certainty of a duel between Macron and Le Pen (in 2022),\" one government source said.  Disunity Frances mainstream parties struggled to recover after Macron dynamited the traditional left-right divide in 2017.  Sundays votes showed the old system making a tentative return.  Deep rifts run through the conservatives and Bertrand, once nicknamed \"floc floc\" for the sound his rubber-soled shoes made on parliaments stone floor, must first persuade his own side he is the man for the centre-right ticket in 2022 - a task made more difficult after he quit the Les Republicains party in 2017.  A moderate among the centre-rights ranks, Bertrand is disliked in particular by allies of Sarkozy, the former president under whom he served as labour minister and who still holds sway over Les Republicains.  Two other centre-right presidential aspirants, Laurent Wauquiez and Valerie Pecresse, were both re-elected to their regional presidency seats.  Asked on Monday about her intention to run, Pecresse said she would take time to reflect over the summer.  Wauquiez left no doubt his ambitions for the Elysee Palace remained intact.  Bertrand paints himself as a common-sense man with his feet planted in provincial France, from where so much of the anti-Macron anger over his perceived disconnect with common folk percolates up from.  \"He needs to make the centre-right electorate who left us for Macron want to vote for him,\" said one Les Republicains lawmaker.  \"But hes not the most glamorous of candidates, and that matters somewhat. \" Voter discontent with the wider political class drove two in every three voters to abstain in Sundays vote.  \"Its the cry of a France from which we demand more each day yet receives nothing but contempt and indifference in return,\" Bertrand told his supporters. ", "article_2": "On Sunday, Bertrand cruised to victory in the first round of a regional election in northern France | Francois Presti/AFP via Getty Images Press play to listen to this article Voiced by Amazon Polly BRETEUIL, France -- Xavier Bertrand is used to being underestimated: The former insurance salesman has been belittled for most of his life.  Now he may be on his way to disrupting Frances next presidential election.  On Sunday, Bertrand -- a two-time minister who says he was sneered at because he was a \"provincial oaf, whod never been to an elite school\" -- cruised to victory in the first round of a regional election in northern France, knocking out rivals from Marine Le Pens National Rally and President Emmanuel Macrons La Republique en Marche (LREM).  In a hardscrabble region that has become a bastion for the far-right, Bertrands crushing victory over the National Rally rival dealt a blow to Le Pen, proving that her allies could be defeated by a conservative.  And it forced the rest of the French political class to take note of Bertrand, whose bid for the presidency, announced in March, has until now failed to garner much attention.  But with a victory in his pocket, Bertrand -- who as an MP was nicknamed \"floc floc\" because of the sound his rubber shoes made on the marbled floors of the National Assembly -- now looks like he could create trouble for either frontrunner in the presidential race.  Macron and Le Pen are neck and neck in the polls ahead of the presidential election next year.  While Bertrands chances of beating them are thin, he could create trouble by peeling off enough voters to stop them from reaching the runoff round.  On Sunday evening, when the regional election results were announced, Bertrand took no prisoners.  \"We smashed the jaws of the National Front, their inflammatory words and pointless proposals,\" he said.  Polls suggest Bertrand would get 14 percent of the vote in the presidential election, less than Le Pen and Macron, and be knocked out at the first round.  But could a resounding victory in the north change the narrative? Family man At a meeting in the village of Breteuil in the Hauts-de-France region, Bertrand worked his audience with the confidence of a seasoned politician, reeling off a list of local measures to boost jobs and tackle crime.  His brand is conservatism with a welfare twist.  He also took a dig at technocrats who \"are walking calculators but cant add up\" and at lENA, the elite administrative school that produced most of Frances presidents, including Macron.  Its an institution that teaches everything except \"common sense,\" Bertrand told his audience.  Breteuil is Yellow Jackets territory and Bertrand knows it.  In 2018, locals in hi-vis vests were demonstrating against rising taxes in the parking lot of the nearby supermarket.  \"People you know,\" Bertrand told the audience.  Xavier Bertrand at a rally in the village of Breteuil, Hauts-de-France | Clea Caulcutt for POLITICO Bertrands secret weapon is exactly what made him a loser in Paris.  His short stature, his past as a provincial mayor, his low-brow cultural tastes.  Voters say they can relate to him.  \"He is a simple man, close to the people,\" said Sylvie Debuysere, a funeral parlor owner.  \"There are two worlds in France: The world of the elite and the rest.  He speaks to the rest. \" \"I didnt believe in him when he was a candidate the first time round,\" said Lionel Gauchy, who owns a small car parts factory.  \"But he keeps his word, and we saw him out in the field every day. \" Ahead of the presidential election, Bertrand hopes he can tap into Frances dissatisfaction with its elites.  National Rally in retreat But Bertrands victory may have less to do with his popular brand of conservatism and more to do with whats happening inside the National Rally.  In the nearby village of Montdidier, the far-right partys vote has melted away, from 43 percent in the last regional election to 22 percent last Sunday.  \"People vote for Marine Le Pen for the presidential election, but not for the local elections,\" said business owner Lionel Swaenepoel.  \"We dont know the little guys running as candidates. \" There is also unease with the direction the party has been taking.  \"People are fed up, thats why they didnt vote,\" said Swaenepoel.  \"Marine Le Pen isnt aggressive enough, unlike her father.  We dont give a fig about her party manifesto, about her economic program, we want her to kick the migrants out. \" \"She is moving away from the fundamental values of the party,\" said retired electrician Jean-Pascal Devaux.  \"When I listen to her, she sounds almost left-wing and shes far too soft on crime and on immigration. \" Since her defeat to Macron in 2017, Le Pen has been seeking to bring the party more into the mainstream, dumping unpopular policies and toning down her attacks on Islam and immigration in order to woo traditional conservative voters.  But the risk was always that this shift would put off the historic base of the party.  If true, this is good news for Bertrand, although it is also possible they will return to Le Pen come crunch time.  \"There are reasons why they are falling out of love [with Le Pen],\" said Bertrand confidently.  \"But maybe its also because we deliver. \" \"And there are lots of studies that show that the French dont want the Macron vs.  Le Pen duel,\" he added.  Bertrand certainly doesnt want it.  Conservative leadership race Bertrand first has to convince his camp, the center-right Les Republicains (LR), that he is the right man for the job.  Many do not like him, in particular his former boss Nicolas Sarkozy, who still holds a lot of influence over the conservative camp.  Bertrand insists he is running as a candidate whatever happens in an attempt to squash any competing bids within the conservative party.  With only 10 months to go until the election, the LR is dawdling over whether to hold primaries or let party grandees chose a candidate.  Rivals include Valerie Pecresse, who is running for the presidency of the greater Paris region, and the senator Bruno Retailleau.  \"Floc floc\" still has a long way to go before he can challenge the two favorites in the race.  For a start theres the second round of the regional election coming up this weekend.  But theres one twist he will particularly savor on the treacherous path to the Elysee: On Sunday, Macron, officially a resident of Le Touquet in the Hauts-de-France, is expected to vote for Bertrand. ", "article_3": "French politician Xavier Bertrand campaigns for his reelection as President of Region Hauts-de-France.  Jean Catuffe | Getty Images News | Getty Images There's a new face in French politics who could pose a serious challenge to President Emmanuel Macron and his re-election ambitions.  Xavier Bertrand, a politician from the center-right Les Republicains party, won Sunday's regional vote with around 52% of support in the northern region of Hauts-de-France.  He beat the candidate from the far right, who got around 26% of the votes, according to exit polls published by France's interior ministry.  \"The National Front was stopped, and we have strongly pushed it back,\" Bertrand said during a victory speech on Sunday in relation to the far-right party, which was renamed National Rally in 2018.  In Sunday's regional vote, marked by a very high level of abstentions, Bertrand's party experienced strong support across the country.  On the other hand, Marine Le Pen's National Rally and La Republique en Marche, of the incumbent Macron, failed to win in any of the regions.  watch now Bertrand also said Sunday that the result gave him the strength to meet the needs of all French people, hinting at his aspirations of becoming president at elections next year.  Les Republicains has yet to choose who will lead its presidential campaign, but after Sunday's vote, Bertrand is well placed to win the nomination.  \"He is currently the best placed among potential right-wing candidates in the first round of the presidential election,\" Eric Mengus, associate professor at H. E. C.  Paris Business School, said via email.  \"Yet, the nomination (within Les Republicains) is still open and will take place only in the fall,\" Mengus added.  Bertrand has seen his popularity levels increase over the past few weeks, currently polling 16% among the main candidates for next year's presidential election.  Le Pen is first in the same poll with 26% of the support, followed by Macron at 25%, according to a poll of polls.  watch now \"This regional election is definitely bad news both for Ms Le Pen and for President Macron and it may create a positive dynamic for right-wing candidates,\" Mengus also said.  Bertrand served as labor minister and later as a health minister during the presidency of Nicolas Sarkozy, between 2007 and 2012.  He began his career in insurance and uses his provincial roots to show he is not an elite member of society.  Speaking on Sunday, Bertrand said his priority was helping the middle class.  Bertrand has, if selected by his party, until April 2022 to win enough support to battle it out in the second round of the presidential election.  \"Le Pen's poor performance is bitter-sweet for Macron.  It robs her of momentum before next year's presidential election and will re-ignite criticisms of her within her own movement.  But Macron also knows that he would beat Le Pen more easily next April than a candidate of a revived traditional or centre-right [party], such as Xavier Bertrand,\" Mujtaba Rahman, managing director at consultancy firm Eurasia Group, said in a note on Sunday night.  watch now", "article_4": "Les Republicains candidates for the 2022 presidential election Michel Barnier, Valerie Pecresse, Philippe Juvin, Eric Ciotti and Xavier Bertrand (from left) took part in their first televised debate Monday, hosted by news channel LCI.  French right-wing presidential candidates vying to clinch the nomination for the Republicans party took aim at President Emmanuel Macron on Monday in the first of several televised debates they hope will energise their flagging campaigns.  Advertising Read more More than 100,000 card-carrying members of the party, which traces its roots back to post-war leader Charles de Gaulle, will choose their nominee at a congress on December 4.  Five candidates took part in three hours of debate on Monday night that saw broad consensus on traditional right-wing themes such as immigration, delinquency and radical Islam--as well as the perceived inadequacies of Macron.  Former EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier called security \"the main failure of this presidential term\", while regional leader Valerie Pecresse accused the 43-year-old head of state of \"burning up our cash\" with his management of the Covid-19 crisis.  Xavier Bertrand, seen by the Republicans rank-and-file as the most credible candidate before the debate, blamed Macron for the emergence of far-right pundit Eric Zemmour whose radical rhetoric has shaken up the presidential race.  \"French people want to turn the page on Macron because hes failed.  Im convinced Im the one who can beat him.  Its not the extremes that can beat him,\" Bertrand concluded.  Polls currently suggest that none of the Republicans (LR) candidates will make it past the first round of the two-stage election in what would mark another crushing setback for a party which counts de Gaulle, Jacques Chirac and Nicolas Sarkozy as past presidents.  Macron is widely seen as the favourite to win next April, though analysts warn that the election remains highly unpredictable.  Part of the problem for the Republicans is the number of defections of senior figures over the last five years to Macrons centrist camp, while Zemmour is also seen as draining conservatives away from the party, analysts say.  Sarkozy, who remains popular among right-wing voters, has been convicted twice this year, effectively ending any chances he has of attempting another comeback after a first failed try five years ago.  Momentum In the run-up to the debate, Barnier had benefited from a flurry of positive headlines about his chances of clinching the nomination for LR, with some media reports referring to him as favourite.  Supporters had promoted the 70-year-old as a possible \"French Joe Biden\"--a moderate, grey-haired statesman capable of uniting his divided political family.  In one of few clashes, he was attacked by Pecresse and Bertrand over his proposal for a moratorium on immigration, which he revealed would mean merely reductions in the number of visas granted to foreigners, rather than zero immigration.  \"My friends are pretending to not understand my moratorium,\" he complained.  >> How the French 'great replacement theory conquered the far right Of the three leading candidates, Bertrand, the moderate head of the northern Hauts-de-France region, is seen by 54 percent of LR members as \"in a position to win the presidency\", according to a poll released Monday.  Only 26 percent saw Barnier as best placed, and 16 percent favoured Pecresse, the head of the greater Paris region.  But Bertrand publicly quit the party in 2017 and had intended to shun the primary and run as an independent, only to relent last month under pressure.  Analysts say this could count against him in the nominating process, whereas Barnier is seen as having shown loyalty to the party over a decades-long career that has taken him from his home in the French Alps to Paris and then Brussels.  In 2017, the party suffered humiliation and disappointment when its presidential candidate, Francois Fillon, became embroiled in multiple financial scandals which saw the hardline former prime minister eliminated in the first round.

After World War II, he served three times as Prime Minister. First ministry (11 September 1948 - 28 October 1949)  Changes: 12 January 1949 - Maurice Petsche succeeds Queuille as Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs.  13 February 1949 - Robert Lecourt succeeds Marie as Vice President of the Council and Minister of Justice. Third ministry (10 March - 11 August 1951) ", "article_1": "I was planning to come and visit the Resistance Museum anyway but I was further drawn here by an advert about an exhibition of photographs of the resistance camps during the Second World War.  The [Correze] Departmental Museum of the Resistance is an unprepossessing building in a fairly nondescript side street in the small village of Neuvic, in fact despite signs pointing the way it is relatively easy to miss it.  Stepping inside, the member of staff explained that the museum was split into 3 areas.  The ground floor off to the left contained the photograph collection I had come to see and the remainder of that floor was dedicated to the Statesman Henri Queuille.  He was a local doctor who between the wars held various ministerial appointments and who became Prime Minister on three occasions after WW2.  The whole of the upstairs was the other reason for my visit, displays about the Resistance activity in the Haute Correze and the Gorges of the Haute Dordogne during the latter stages of the Second World War.  Back to earth, at least on the Ground Floor, were the black and white photograph, the existence of which must have posed a unique threat at the time to the Maquisards depicted, capture stark images of several of the freedom fighters and the conditions in which they lived in the various makeshift camps around the area.  Grainy faces stare back at the camera with a kind of haunted look that seems typical of the era.  Sharing the floor, the various displays about Henri Queuille go into great detail about his life, positions of state, honours he was awarded etc.  interesting in itself but learning about him wasnt the reason I had come.  Climbing the stairs to the first floor you encounter a vast amount of detail about the Resistance Activity in the area during the latter stages of the War, principally after the occupation of the Vichy controlled areas.  Detailed display boards on the walls cover many subjects and these are supplemented by a Free Audio tour, the kind that has numbered symbols in different areas that equate to the different sound clips on the device - one picks up the recorder at the Information Desk by the entrance and the soundtrack is available in at least English and French.  There are photographs, models, memorabilia, uniforms, maps and display cases of weapons and ammunition.  Separate to this I found one particular exhibit fascinating, a period radio which on demand played snippets of a BBC broadcast during the war featuring General de Gaulle as well as different coded messages to different Resistance Groups, all heralded by the now familiar opening bars of 'Beethovens Fifth.  Equally on one wall there were two maps side by side, one showing the location of the various landings/supply drops and the other the location of the different acts of sabotage carried out at the time, the sheer scale of which were eye-opening given that these just depicted events in the Correze.  There is also a wealth of detail about the multiple organisations that comprised 'the Resistance - the Armee Secret (AS) and the Francs-Tireurs et Partisans (FTP) amongst them for example, and people and their positions within them.  I was so pleased I made the trip, it was a fascinating and eye-opening insight into the clandestine world of the Maquis and their fight against oppression and occupation.

When his father, a chemist, died in 1895, the Queuilles moved to Tulle where the teenager attended the lycee starting in 1896.  The young graduate studied medicine in Paris, where he made friends with Maurice Bedel and Georges Duhamel, before moving back to his home town in 1908.  In 1910, he married Margueritte Gratadour de Sarrazin, with whom he had two children - Suzanne and Pierre.  He rapidly rose in politics: member of the town council in 1912, mayor and general councillor of the Correze department the following year, and member of Parliament in 1914.  During the First World War, his service as a doctor with various ambulances on the Eastern Front earned him the Croix de Guerre 14-18.  A moderate member of the Radical Party, he entered the government of Alexandre Millerand in July 1920 as Undersecretary for Agriculture.  Recognised by his peers, he held many ministerial portfolios (Agriculture, Health, Post, Public Works, Supplies), being appointed minister nineteen times between 1920 and 1940.  He was the main driving force behind French agricultural policy between the wars (creation of rural engineering, creation and organisation of agricultural education, technical development of the countryside, etc. ); he notably presided over the Federation Nationale de la Mutualite et de la Cooperation Agricole (National Federation of Reciprocity and Agricultural Cooperation).  He nationalised the railways and created the SNCF (French National Railway Company), and headed the Office National des Mutiles, Combattants, Victimes de Guerre et Pupilles de la Nation (1937).  In 1939 he published Le Drame agricole: un aspect de la crise economique.  A staunch supporter of the Republic who worked with the Socialists, he became close with Edouard Herriot, but refused to vote to hand over full powers to Marechal Philippe Petain on 10 July 1940.  He was then removed from his functions as mayor of Neuvic.  His son Pierres membership in the Resistance made his contacts with Free France easier.  Hettier de Boislambert convinced him to leave for the United Kingdom.  He reached London in April-May 1943, along with Astier de la Vigerie, Daniel Mayer and Jean-Pierre Levy, despite his distrust of de Gaulle.  In May, he sent out a call to the French peasantry over the BBC, and was then appointed President of the landing commission in charge of developing the measures to be taken upon the Liberation of France.  Two months later, the Vichy government issued a decree stripping Henri Queuille of his French nationality and his mandate as Senator.  In August, he left for Algiers, where de Gaulle, bringing together the political parties, brought him into the Comite Francais de Liberation Nationale (CFLN - French Committee of National Liberation) in November 1943.  Queuille asked to be relieved of his functions in September 1944, when the government moved to Paris, to return to his political career.  He was elected mayor in October 1945, then member of Parliament in the legislative elections of 1946.  The war memoirs written by this recipient of the Medaille de la Resistance were published in Journal 1939/1945.  Loyal to Edouard Herriot, he headed the government of the 4th Republic between July 1948 and June 1954.  He was President of the Council (Premier) three times, curbing social unrest, the rise of Gaullism and government instability, applying a policy people called \"immobilism\"; he did not hesitate when it came to using force (October-November 1948) and postponing elections.  But this policy enabled the Republic to survive.  His foreign policy activities led to the signature of a Franco-Vietnamese agreement in March 1949, practically recognising the colonys independence, made France a member of the Atlantic Alliance and implemented the Marshall Plan the following month.  Defeated in the legislative elections of 1958, Henri Queuille returned to life in local politics.  He transformed his town into a leisure resort, set up an agricultural high school and a technical school.  Pursuing work on his memoirs that he had started in 1944, he gathered archives, documents, eye-witness accounts and objects from the Second World War and the Resistance, thus comprising the main collection of the Museum that bears his name.

For the social networking service, see Ablo Virgil Abloh ( ; September 30, 1980 - November 28, 2021) was an American fashion designer and entrepreneur.  He was the artistic director of Louis Vuitton's menswear collection beginning in 2018, and was given increased creative responsibilities across the LVMH brand in early 2021. Abloh was also the chief executive officer of the Milan-based label Off-White, a fashion house he founded in 2013.  A trained architect, Abloh, who also worked in Chicago street fashion, entered the world of international fashion with an internship at Fendi in 2009, alongside American rapper Kanye West.  Abloh assumed the role of Creative Director at Donda, West's creative agency in 2010.  In 2013, Abloh founded Off-White.  The first African-American to be artistic director at a French luxury fashion house when he joined LVMH in 2018, Abloh was named by Time magazine as one of the 100 most influential people in the world that year. Abloh's design aesthetic which bridged streetwear and luxury clothing was described as transformative by The New York Times. According to The Wall Street Journal, he reached a level of global fame unusual for a designer, and as an inspirational figure, according to the BBC. Virgil Abloh was born on September 30, 1980, in Rockford, Illinois, to Ghanaian immigrant parents. His mother was a seamstress and his father managed a paint company. From his mother, he learned how to sew.  Abloh was raised in Rockford, where he attended Boylan Catholic High School, graduating in 1998. He graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2002 with a Bachelor of Science degree in civil engineering. He received his Master of Architecture at the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) in 2006. When Abloh was attending IIT, there was a building on campus under construction designed by the architect Rem Koolhaas (who had also worked on runway collections for Prada).  Koolhaas's building helped spark his interest in fashion. Abloh was further inspired by Crown Hall, a modernist masterpiece designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. Abloh's master's thesis project involved a design for a Chicago skyscraper, which curved in the direction of Lake Michigan, as if leaning toward the rising sun. While studying architecture, he also designed T-shirts and wrote on fashion and design for a well-known blog, The Brilliance. Abloh first met popular musician Kanye West while working on his designs at a Chicago print shop. 2009-2013: Rise to prominence  After getting his architecture degree, Abloh interned at Fendi in the same class as rapper Kanye West in 2009. Placed in the company's Rome, Italy office, the two began a collaborative relationship. During his work with the rapper and designer, Abloh caught the eye of the Louis Vuitton CEO, Michael Burke. Later that year, Abloh and West's artistic partner, Don C, launched a retail store, called the RSVP Gallery, located in Chicago. The store became known for carrying a mixture of fashion apparel, and for its reflection of Abloh's style on his design for the store interior. A year later, West appointed Abloh the creative director of his creative agency, Donda. In 2011, West asked him to serve as the artistic director for the 2011 Jay-Z/West album Watch the Throne. In 2012, Abloh designed the cover art for WZRDs self-titled debut. In 2012, Abloh launched his first company, Pyrex Vision. He purchased deadstock clothing from Ralph Lauren for $40, screen-printed designs on them and sold them for prices upward of $550. He closed the company down a year later as he did not intend it to be a commercial enterprise, but an artistic experiment. 2013-2017: Off-White and mainstream success  In a large part streetwear is seen as cheap.  What my goal has been is to add an intellectual layer to it and make it credible --Abloh on the inspiration behind founding high-end streetwear label, Off-White. Abloh founded his first fashion house and second business overall in 2013 with the high-end streetwear brand Off-White, designing a logo inspired by Ben Kelly. Based in Milan, Italy, the company was described by Abloh as \"the gray area between black and white as the color off-white\" to investors and fashion critics. During the launch of his brand, he received help from the New Guards Group, who also assisted many other designers and brands, such as Palm Angels, Heron Preston, and Marcelo Burlon. Abloh said his first Off-White collection was inspired by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe's floating glass home, Farnsworth House, and presented it with references to the Baroque artist Caravaggio and the early 20th century German design studio The Bauhaus. The brand lead generated widespread attention for his apparel beginning in Paris, then expanding to China, Japan, and the United States. The clothing line can be identified through its use of quotation marks, zip-ties, capital letters, and barricade tape. He launched the company's women's wear line in 2014 and showed the collections at Paris Fashion Week. His line was selected as a finalist for the LVMH Prize, an industry award, but lost to Marques'Almeida and Jacquemus. Abloh launched his first concept store for Off-White in Tokyo, Japan, where he started the company's furniture arm, Grey Area. Through Abloh's re-designing he exercised his self-made rule of only editing the shoes 3% of the way because he was intrigued by still maintaining the original design of the shoe. 2013-2018: Off-White and collaborations  By the end of 2018, an index of sales and consumer sentiment ranked Off-White as the hottest label in the world, surpassing Gucci. Virgil also partnered up with the Swedish furniture company IKEA to design furniture for apartments and houses as well as easy to carry tote bags with the word sculpture imprinted in the middle. The collection was named Markerad, which is a Swedish word meaning \"clear-cut; crisp; pronounced\", and was released in 2019. Virgil envisioned that the collection would include practical furniture featuring contemporary designs. In 2017, he was asked to design a new collection in conjunction with Nike entitled \"The Ten\" and he re-designed a variety of the company's best-selling shoes. Abloh worked towards fulfilling his vision for the IKEA collection by sketching out drafts of generic pieces of furniture, while adding his own aesthetics to the designs by using a doorstop to level out furniture items. Abloh worked on designs for chairs, coffee tables, beds, storage cabinets, mirrors, and carpets apart of his collaboration with IKEA. Abloh used quotation marks to convey detachment from society and social norms. During the rise in neo-nationalism in 2017 Abloh worked with conceptual artist Jenny Holzer to create a line emphasizing the positive aspects of immigration, cultural integration, and globalization. In December 2017, he worked with Holzer again to design T-shirts for Planned Parenthood in response to the Women's March on Washington. Abloh incorporated the LV logo in his debut menswear collection for the brand.  On March 25, 2018, Abloh was named artistic director of Louis Vuitton's menswear ready wear line, making him the first person of African descent to lead the brand's menswear line, as well as one of the few black designers at the helm of a major French fashion house. Upon his acceptance of the position, he stated, \"It is an honor for me to accept this position.  I find the heritage and creative integrity of the house are key inspirations and will look to reference them both while drawing parallels to modern times\". Abloh showed his first collection for Louis Vuitton at the 2018 Men's Fashion Week at the Palais-Royal gardens in Paris. Rihanna was the first well known person to wear Abloh prior to this watershed show. Playboi Carti, Steve Lacy, A$AP Nast, Dev Hynes, and Kid Cudi walked the runway for Abloh's debut Vuitton show. Abloh was in high demand thereafter for his designs, creating an original outfit designed for Serena Williams to wear throughout the 2018 US Open, a collaboration with Nike. On June 5, 2018, Abloh released a special collaboration with the luggage manufacturer Rimowa, a transparent suitcase in a limited edition. In March 2019, Abloh collaborated with Ikea to start making furniture for millennials, ranging from cabinets, rugs, coffee tables, and chairs.  Abloh incorporated different elements of style, such as his quotation marks around certain words and putting it on different articles of clothing, and in this case different types of furniture. For example, Abloh created a \"Door Stop Interruption\" on a chair by adding a doorstop on one of the chair legs to make it elevated.  One of Abloh's most popular items is the Frakta Bag.  It is beige with the text \"SCULPTURE\" imprinted on the side. In March 2019 Abloh teamed up with SSENSE to release a workout collection.  This collection contained a variety of workout clothes ranging from; matching leggings and sports bras, athletic sweaters, and crop tops.  The collection incorporated some of Abloh's signature designs by including the Off-White yellow sign wrapping around the waist of the pants and bottom of the sports bras. Abloh also included a three-dimensional addition of his four-way arrows, creating a cross, on the front of the tops and pants. \"I now have a platform to change the industry .  .  .  Were designers, so we can start a trend, we can highlight issues, we can make a lot of people focus on something or we can cause a lot of people to focus on ourselves.  .  .  Im not interested in (the latter).  Im interested in using my platform as one of a very small group of African-American males to design a house, to sort of show people in a poetic way.  -- Virgil Abloh (2018) Abloh was featured in conversation with his friend and frequent collaborator Takashi Murakami on the cover of the fall 2018 issue of Cultured magazine. In 2019, Abloh was appointed to the board of directors of The Council of Fashion Designers of America.  The council seeks to promote the American fashion industry. Abloh created a custom Off-White gown and veil for Hailey Bieber's wedding day.  On the veil, he included his famous quotation marks design around the words \"till death do us part\". In July 2021, LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton announced it would be taking a 60% stake in Off-White, with founder Abloh, then the creative director of menswear for Louis Vuitton, retaining the remaining 40%. At the same time, Abloh was given greater creative control across the LVMH brand. Abloh worked frequently with Japanese artist Takashi Murakami.  Abloh was given a solo art show in Murakami's Kaikai Kiki art gallery in Tokyo, Japan.  On numerous occasions, their artwork has been showcased together such as the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago and Murakami's shop Oz Zingaro in Tokyo. In 2018, Abloh and Murakami collaborated on a series of exhibitions at Gagosian Gallery's outposts in London, Paris, and Beverly Hills. In 2019, Abloh was introduced the MCA speech campaign for the era for the CTA's Red Line train wrap. Abloh's first solo art exhibition occurred at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago in 2019. After Chicago, Virgil Abloh: Figures of Speech traveled to the High Museum of Art, the Institute of Contemporary Art/Boston, and Qatar Museums, as part of the Qatar-USA 2021 Year of Culture. The exhibition was intended to offer a mid-career retrospective of Abloh's endeavors in art, design and music. From July 1, 2022 - January 29, 2023, The Brooklyn Museum will be displaying Figures of Speech.  Brooklyn's edition of the exhibition will be fully devoted to Ablohs work, spanning two decades of the artists practice, including collaborations with artist Takashi Murakami, musician Kanye West, and architect Rem Koolhaas, among others; material from his fashion label Off-White; and items from Louis Vuitton, where he served as the first Black menswear artistic director.  This particular version of the installation will also offer a space for gathering and performances, and is designed to counter the historical lack of space afforded to Black artists and Black people in cultural institutions. Abloh's interest in music led him to DJing beginning in his teens.  He DJ'd at house parties throughout high school and college. His influences included DJ's A-Trak, Benji B, and Gilles Peterson. Over the years, Abloh gained recognition as a DJ and started playing shows internationally.  He played at Hi Ibiza and was also booked for the 2019 edition of the Tomorrowland festival. Abloh released his first single \"Orvnge\" with German DJ/producer Boys Noize in January 2018. In June 2019, Abloh was named to a DJ residency at Wynn Las Vegas's XS Nightclub, with Wynn also agreeing to open an Off-White store. In May 2019 Pioneer, maker of DJ consoles, announced its collaboration with Abloh in design of its transparent CDJ-2000NXS2 and DJM-900NXS2 models. The consoles were displayed at Chicago's Museum of Contemporary Art in the Figures of Speech Exhibition. In June 2020, Abloh designed the original cover for Pop Smoke album, Shoot for the Stars, Aim for the Moon.  The original cover came under heavy criticism from fans.  On July 2, a new cover, designed by Ryder Ripps, was revealed along with the album's release. Abloh also worked on album art for artists Lil Uzi Vert, Kid Cudi, and Westside Gunn. In 2021, he launched a new monthly two-hour internet radio show on Worldwide FM, \"Imaginary Radio\" c/o Virgil Abloh.  The show featured DJ sets and interviews with musicians and other creatives; early guests included artists like electronic artist Omar-S and Alex Sowinski of BadBadNotGood. He previously had a show on Apple Music 1 called \"TELEVISED RADIO\".  Five episodes were released between 2018 and 2020. Abloh noted that one of his principles is that a new design can be created by changing an original by only three percent. He described his approach as being \"ironic detachment\" and that Duchamp's precedent \"gives him the grounds to copy and paste, to take and to re-apply. \" This philosophy caused Abloh to be accused of plagiarism and appropriation. The originality of Off-White's logo design with its alternating parallel diagonal lines has been contested by a number of parties, including Ben Kelly, who popularized this graphic in the early 1980s. Fashion blog Diet Prada has compared several of Abloh's designs, from chairs to apparel, with existing designs. Abloh's FW 2019 collection was based on his \"ultimate muse,\" Michael Jackson.  The launch occurred one week prior to the release of Leaving Neverland at the Sundance Film Festival. In response, Louis Vuitton announced they would not produce any items that directly featured Michael Jackson elements. Abloh also received criticism in early 2019 when images of his Off-White team suggested a lack of cultural diversity at his head office. In 2019, LVMH recorded a 20% growth in sales that were in part attributed to his appointment. However, in December 2019 Abloh predicted that streetwear would die in 2020 as people moved to vintage clothing. On the March 2020 launch of his collaboration with Japanese streetwear designer Nigo, Abloh retracted his earlier comments clarifying that he was only riffing, describing himself as a novice. During the George Floyd protests in mid-2020, Abloh attracted criticism after posting on social media a screenshot showing that he had made a $50 donation to Miami-based art collective (F)empower to go towards protesters' legal costs, adding that he was \"crazy inspired\". He later said on Instagram that \"I can understand your frustration if you think my contributions were limited to $50. . .  [that is] purely false when it comes to the total.  I have donated $20,500 to bail funds and other causes related to this movement\", and continued, \"I will continue to donate more and will continue to use my voice to urge my peers to do the same\". Abloh also subsequently stated that the looting of businesses during the George Floyd protests was an example of why streetwear \"is dead\". In 2020, he established the Virgil Abloh \"Post-Modern\" Scholarship Fund.  Abloh raised $1 million for the scholarships which will be managed by the Fashion Scholarship Fund to assist Black students. In July 2020, Abloh's brand Off-White launched a fundraising program called \"I Support Young Black Businesses\" that sold Hoodies and T-Shirts with \"I Support Young Black Businesses\" written on them. All of those proceeds went to an organization called Chicago CRED, aimed to diminish gun violence. Also that year, with Nike he finished the redesign and renovations of the Boys and Girls Club facility in East Garfield Park, Chicago. Abloh spent significant amounts of his time to mentor and provide mentoring resources to young designers. Abloh received his first major award in 2011 when his work designing the cover art for American rappers Jay-Z and Kanye West's collaborative album Watch the Throne was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Recording Package. In 2015, Abloh (for Off-White) was one of the finalists for the LVMH Prize.  Abloh was the only American designer to be nominated for the award that year.  Abloh's Charlie Hebdo-inspired \"War is Not Over!\" tees as well as his toppers from his fall 2015 women's collection gained him the most traction. He received the Urban Luxe award at the 2017 British Fashion Awards. He also won International designer of the Year at the GQ Men of the Year awards in 2017. Abloh's Off-White Air Jordan \"the Ten\" collaboration won 2017's Shoe of the Year and he received the nod for Accessory Designer of the Year. Abloh was listed as one of Time magazine's 100 most influential people in the world in 2018, one of two designers named that year. In the Time issue, Japanese artist Takashi Murakami wrote that Abloh's impressive achievements led to his listing. In December 2018, Abloh was honored as a leading innovator by Ebony Power 100. Abloh was also nominated for 2019 Menswear Designer of the Year. Abloh lived in Chicago with his wife, Shannon, and their two children. In 2019, Abloh was diagnosed with cardiac angiosarcoma, a type of cancer, though he kept the diagnosis private.  He died on November 28, 2021, at the age of 41, in Chicago. LVMH with the family's permission paid tribute to Abloh at their planned November 30 spin-out fashion show in Miami, with a theme of \"Virgil was here\".  Kanye West, Kim Kardashian, Rihanna, ASAP Rocky, Bella Hadid, Pharrell Williams, Tahar Rahim, Venus Williams, Joe Jonas, Ricky Martin, Jeremy Pope, 21 Savage, Joan Smalls, and Bernard Arnault attended the tribute.  Louis Vuitton dedicated its window-displays worldwide, also using the dedication \"Virgil was here\". Abloh's private funeral took place on December 6, 2021, in Chicago, with Drake; Rihanna; Kanye West; Kim Kardashian; Kid Cudi; Tyler, the Creator; ASAP Rocky; Frank Ocean; Vic Mensa; Lauryn Hill; Don C; and Jerry Lorenzo in attendance amongst his family and other close friends.", "article_1": "1st-century-BC Roman poet This article is about the ancient Roman poet.  For the grammarian, see Virgilius Maro Grammaticus .  For other uses, see Virgil (disambiguation) Publius Vergilius Maro ( Classical Latin: ['pu:bliUs wer'gIliUs 'maro:]; traditional dates 15 October 70 - 21 September 19 BC), usually called Virgil or Vergil ( VUR-jil) in English, was an ancient Roman poet of the Augustan period.  He composed three of the most famous poems in Latin literature: the Eclogues (or Bucolics), the Georgics, and the epic Aeneid.  A number of minor poems, collected in the Appendix Vergiliana, were attributed to him in ancient times, but modern scholars consider his authorship of these poems as dubious. Virgil's work has had wide and deep influence on Western literature, most notably Dante's Divine Comedy, in which Virgil appears as the author's guide through Hell and Purgatory. Virgil has been traditionally ranked as one of Rome's greatest poets.  His Aeneid is also considered a national epic of ancient Rome, a title held since composition. Birth and biographical tradition  Virgil's biographical tradition is thought to depend on a lost biography by the Roman poet Varius.  This biography was incorporated into an account by the historian Suetonius, as well as the later commentaries of Servius and Donatus (the two great commentators on Virgil's poetry).  Although the commentaries record much factual information about Virgil, some of their evidence can be shown to rely on allegorizing and on inferences drawn from his poetry.  For this reason, details regarding Virgil's life story are considered somewhat problematic.: 1602 According to these accounts, Publius Vergilius Maro was born in the village of Andes, near Mantua[i] in Cisalpine Gaul (northern Italy, added to Italy proper during his lifetime). Analysis of his name has led some to believe that he descended from earlier Roman colonists.  Modern speculation, however, ultimately is not supported by narrative evidence from either his own writings or his later biographers.  Macrobius says that Virgil's father was of a humble background, though scholars generally believe that Virgil was from an equestrian landowning family who could afford to give him an education.  He attended schools in Cremona, Mediolanum, Rome, and Naples.  After briefly considering a career in rhetoric and law, the young Virgil turned his talents to poetry. According to Robert Seymour Conway, the only ancient source which reports the actual distance between Andes and Mantua is a surviving fragment from the works of Marcus Valerius Probus.  Probus flourished during the reign of Nero (AD 54-68). Probus reports that Andes was located 30 Roman miles from Mantua.  Conway translated this to a distance of about 45 kilometres or 28 miles. Relatively little is known about the family of Virgil.  His father reportedly belonged to gens Vergilia, and his mother belonged to gens Magia. According to Conway, gens Vergilia is poorly attested in inscriptions from the entire Northern Italy, where Mantua is located.  Among thousands of surviving ancient inscriptions from this region, there are only 8 or 9 mentions of individuals called \"Vergilius\" (masculine) or \"Vergilia\" (feminine).  Out of these mentions, three appear in inscriptions from Verona, and one in an inscription from Calvisano. Conway theorized that the inscription from Calvisano had to do with a kinswoman of Virgil.  Calvisano is located 30 Roman miles from Mantua, and would fit with Probus's description of Andes. The inscription, in this case, is a votive offering to the Matronae (a group of deities) by a woman called Vergilia, asking the goddesses to deliver from danger another woman, called Munatia.  Conway notes that the offering belongs to a common type for this era, where women made requests for deities to preserve the lives of female loved ones who were pregnant and were about to give birth.  In most cases, the woman making the request was the mother of a woman who was pregnant or otherwise in danger.  Though there is another inscription from Calvisano, where a woman asks the deities to preserve the life of her sister. Munatia, the woman whom Vergilia wished to protect, was likely a close relative of Vergilia, possibly her daughter.  The name \"Munatia\" indicates that this woman was a member of gens Munatia, and makes it likely that Vergilia married into this family. Other studies claim that today's consideration for ancient Andes should be sought in the area of Castel Goffredo. According to the commentators, Virgil received his first education when he was five years old and later went to Cremona, Milan, and finally Rome to study rhetoric, medicine, and astronomy, which he would abandon for philosophy.  From Virgil's admiring references to the neoteric writers Pollio and Cinna, it has been inferred that he was, for a time, associated with Catullus's neoteric circle.  According to Servius, schoolmates considered Virgil extremely shy and reserved, and he was nicknamed \"Parthenias\" (\"virgin\") because of his social aloofness.  Virgil also seems to have suffered bad health throughout his life and in some ways lived the life of an invalid.  According to the Catalepton, he began to write poetry while in the Epicurean school of Siro in Naples.  A group of small works attributed to the youthful Virgil by the commentators survive collected under the title Appendix Vergiliana, but are largely considered spurious by scholars.  One, the Catalepton, consists of fourteen short poems,: 1602 some of which may be Virgil's, and another, a short narrative poem titled the Culex (\"The Gnat\"), was attributed to Virgil as early as the 1st century AD. Eclogues in the 5th-century Vergilius Romanus Page from the beginning of thein the 5th-century The biographical tradition asserts that Virgil began the hexameter Eclogues (or Bucolics) in 42 BC and it is thought that the collection was published around 39-38 BC, although this is controversial.: 1602 The Eclogues (from the Greek for \"selections\") are a group of ten poems roughly modeled on the bucolic (that is, \"pastoral\" or \"rural\") poetry of the Hellenistic poet Theocritus, which were written in dactylic hexameter.  After defeating the army led by the assassins of Julius Caesar in the Battle of Philippi (42 BC), Octavian tried to pay off his veterans with land expropriated from towns in northern Italy, which--according to tradition--included an estate near Mantua belonging to Virgil.  The loss of Virgil's family farm and the attempt through poetic petitions to regain his property have traditionally been seen as his motives in the composition of the Eclogues.  This is now thought to be an unsupported inference from interpretations of the Eclogues.  In Eclogues 1 and 9, Virgil indeed dramatizes the contrasting feelings caused by the brutality of the land expropriations through pastoral idiom but offers no indisputable evidence of the supposed biographic incident.  While some readers have identified the poet himself with various characters and their vicissitudes, whether gratitude by an old rustic to a new god (Ecl.  1), frustrated love by a rustic singer for a distant boy (his master's pet, Ecl.  2), or a master singer's claim to have composed several eclogues (Ecl.  5), modern scholars largely reject such efforts to garner biographical details from works of fiction, preferring to interpret an author's characters and themes as illustrations of contemporary life and thought.  The ten Eclogues present traditional pastoral themes with a fresh perspective.  Eclogues 1 and 9 address the land confiscations and their effects on the Italian countryside.  2 and 3 are pastoral and erotic, discussing both homosexual love (Ecl.  2) and attraction toward people of any gender (Ecl.  3).  Eclogue 4, addressed to Asinius Pollio, the so-called \"Messianic Eclogue\", uses the imagery of the golden age in connection with the birth of a child (who the child was meant to be has been subject to debate).  5 and 8 describe the myth of Daphnis in a song contest, 6, the cosmic and mythological song of Silenus; 7, a heated poetic contest, and 10 the sufferings of the contemporary elegiac poet Cornelius Gallus.  Virgil is credited[by whom?] in the Eclogues with establishing Arcadia as a poetic ideal that still resonates in Western literature and visual arts, and setting the stage for the development of Latin pastoral by Calpurnius Siculus, Nemesianus and later writers. Georgics, by Late 17th-century illustration of a passage from the, by Jerzy Siemiginowski-Eleuter Sometime after the publication of the Eclogues (probably before 37 BC),: 1603 Virgil became part of the circle of Maecenas, Octavian's capable agent d'affaires who sought to counter sympathy for Antony among the leading families by rallying Roman literary figures to Octavian's side.  Virgil came to know many of the other leading literary figures of the time, including Horace, in whose poetry he is often mentioned, and Varius Rufus, who later helped finish the Aeneid.  At Maecenas's insistence (according to the tradition) Virgil spent the ensuing years (perhaps 37-29 BC) on the long didactic hexameter poem called the Georgics (from Greek, \"On Working the Earth\") which he dedicated to Maecenas.  The ostensible theme of the Georgics is instruction in the methods of running a farm.  In handling this theme, Virgil follows in the didactic (\"how to\") tradition of the Greek poet Hesiod's Works and Days and several works of the later Hellenistic poets.  The four books of the Georgics focus respectively on: raising crops; raising trees; livestock and horses; beekeeping and the qualities of bees.  Well-known passages include the beloved Laus Italiae of Book 2, the prologue description of the temple in Book 3, and the description of the plague at the end of Book 3.  Book 4 concludes with a long mythological narrative, in the form of an epyllion which describes vividly the discovery of beekeeping by Aristaeus and the story of Orpheus' journey to the underworld.  Ancient scholars, such as Servius, conjectured that the Aristaeus episode replaced, at the emperor's request, a long section in praise of Virgil's friend, the poet Gallus, who was disgraced by Augustus, and who committed suicide in 26 BC.  The tone of the Georgics tone wavers between optimism and pessimism, sparking critical debate on the poet's intentions,: 1605 but the work lays the foundations for later didactic poetry.  Virgil and Maecenas are said to have taken turns reading the Georgics to Octavian upon his return from defeating Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC. pietas of Aeneas, who carries his aged father and leads his young son A 1st-century terracotta expressing theof Aeneas, who carries his aged father and leads his young son The Aeneid is widely considered Virgil's finest work, and is regarded as one of the most important poems in the history of Western literature (T.  S.  Eliot referred to it as 'the classic of all Europe'). The work (modelled after Homer's Iliad and Odyssey) chronicles a refugee of the Trojan War, named Aeneas, as he struggles to fulfill his destiny.  His intentions are to reach Italy, where his descendants Romulus and Remus are to found the city of Rome.  Virgil worked on the Aeneid during the last eleven years of his life (29-19 BC), commissioned, according to Propertius, by Augustus. The epic poem consists of 12 books in dactylic hexameter verse which describe the journey of Aeneas, a warrior fleeing the sack of Troy, to Italy, his battle with the Italian prince Turnus, and the foundation of a city from which Rome would emerge.  The Aeneid's first six books describe the journey of Aeneas from Troy to Rome.  Virgil made use of several models in the composition of his epic;: 1603 Homer, the pre-eminent author of classical epic, is everywhere present, but Virgil also makes special use of the Latin poet Ennius and the Hellenistic poet Apollonius of Rhodes among the various other writers to which he alludes.  Although the Aeneid casts itself firmly into the epic mode, it often seeks to expand the genre by including elements of other genres such as tragedy and aetiological poetry.  Ancient commentators noted that Virgil seems to divide the Aeneid into two sections based on the poetry of Homer; the first six books were viewed as employing the Odyssey as a model while the last six were connected to the Iliad. Book 1[ii] (at the head of the Odyssean section) opens with a storm which Juno, Aeneas's enemy throughout the poem, stirs up against the fleet.  The storm drives the hero to the coast of Carthage, which historically was Rome's deadliest foe.  The queen, Dido, welcomes the ancestor of the Romans, and under the influence of the gods falls deeply in love with him.  At a banquet in Book 2, Aeneas tells the story of the sack of Troy, the death of his wife, and his escape, to the enthralled Carthaginians, while in Book 3 he recounts to them his wanderings over the Mediterranean in search of a suitable new home.  Jupiter in Book 4 recalls the lingering Aeneas to his duty to found a new city, and he slips away from Carthage, leaving Dido to commit suicide, cursing Aeneas and calling down revenge in symbolic anticipation of the fierce wars between Carthage and Rome.  In Book 5, funeral games are celebrated for Aeneas's father Anchises, who had died a year before.  On reaching Cumae, in Italy in Book 6, Aeneas consults the Cumaean Sibyl, who conducts him through the Underworld where Aeneas meets the dead Anchises who reveals Rome's destiny to his son.  Book 7 (beginning the Iliadic half) opens with an address to the muse and recounts Aeneas's arrival in Italy and betrothal to Lavinia, daughter of King Latinus.  Lavinia had already been promised to Turnus, the king of the Rutulians, who is roused to war by the Fury Allecto and Amata, Lavinia's mother.  In Book 8, Aeneas allies with King Evander, who occupies the future site of Rome, and is given new armor and a shield depicting Roman history.  Book 9 records an assault by Nisus and Euryalus on the Rutulians; Book 10, the death of Evander's young son Pallas; and 11 the death of the Volscian warrior princess Camilla and the decision to settle the war with a duel between Aeneas and Turnus.  The Aeneid ends in Book 12 with the taking of Latinus's city, the death of Amata, and Aeneas's defeat and killing of Turnus, whose pleas for mercy are spurned.  The final book ends with the image of Turnus's soul lamenting as it flees to the underworld. Virgil Reading the Aeneid to Augustus, Octavia, and Livia by Aeneidby Jean-Baptiste Wicar , Art Institute of Chicago Critics of the Aeneid focus on a variety of issues. [iii] The tone of the poem as a whole is a particular matter of debate; some see the poem as ultimately pessimistic and politically subversive to the Augustan regime, while others view it as a celebration of the new imperial dynasty.  Virgil makes use of the symbolism of the Augustan regime, and some scholars see strong associations between Augustus and Aeneas, the one as founder and the other as re-founder of Rome.  A strong teleology, or drive towards a climax, has been detected in the poem.  The Aeneid is full of prophecies about the future of Rome, the deeds of Augustus, his ancestors, and famous Romans, and the Carthaginian Wars; the shield of Aeneas even depicts Augustus's victory at Actium against Mark Antony and Cleopatra VII in 31 BC.  A further focus of study is the character of Aeneas.  As the protagonist of the poem, Aeneas seems to waver constantly between his emotions and commitment to his prophetic duty to found Rome; critics note the breakdown of Aeneas's emotional control in the last sections of the poem where the \"pious\" and \"righteous\" Aeneas mercilessly slaughters Turnus.  The Aeneid appears to have been a great success.  Virgil is said to have recited Books 2, 4, and 6 to Augustus;: 1603 and Book 6 apparently caused the emperor's sister Octavia to faint.  Although the truth of this claim is subject to scholarly skepticism, it has served as a basis for later art, such as Jean-Baptiste Wicar's Virgil Reading the Aeneid.  Unfortunately, some lines of the poem were left unfinished, and the whole was unedited, at Virgil's death in 19 BC.  Virgil's death and editing of the Aeneid  According to the tradition, Virgil traveled to the senatorial province of Achaea in Greece in about 19 BC to revise the Aeneid.  After meeting Augustus in Athens and deciding to return home, Virgil caught a fever while visiting a town near Megara.  After crossing to Italy by ship, weakened with disease, Virgil died in Brundisium harbor on 21 September 19 BC.  Augustus ordered Virgil's literary executors, Lucius Varius Rufus and Plotius Tucca, to disregard Virgil's own wish that the poem be burned, instead ordering it to be published with as few editorial changes as possible.: 112 As a result, the text of the Aeneid that exists may contain faults which Virgil was planning to correct before publication.  However, the only obvious imperfections are a few lines of verse that are metrically unfinished (i. e.  not a complete line of dactylic hexameter).  Some scholars have argued that Virgil deliberately left these metrically incomplete lines for dramatic effect. Other alleged imperfections are subject to scholarly debate. Antiquity  The works of Virgil almost from the moment of their publication revolutionized Latin poetry.  The Eclogues, Georgics, and above all the Aeneid became standard texts in school curricula with which all educated Romans were familiar.  Poets following Virgil often refer intertextually to his works to generate meaning in their own poetry.  The Augustan poet Ovid parodies the opening lines of the Aeneid in Amores 1. 1. 1-2, and his summary of the Aeneas story in Book 14 of the Metamorphoses, the so-called \"mini-Aeneid\", has been viewed as a particularly important example of post-Virgilian response to the epic genre.  Lucan's epic, the Bellum Civile, has been considered an anti-Virgilian epic, disposing of the divine mechanism, treating historical events, and diverging drastically from Virgilian epic practice.  The Flavian poet Statius in his 12-book epic Thebaid engages closely with the poetry of Virgil; in his epilogue he advises his poem not to \"rival the divine Aeneid, but follow afar and ever venerate its footsteps. \" In Silius Italicus, Virgil finds one of his most ardent admirers.  With almost every line of his epic Punica, Silius references Virgil.  Indeed, Silius is known to have bought Virgil's tomb and worshipped the poet. Partially as a result of his so-called \"Messianic\" Fourth Eclogue - widely interpreted later to have predicted the birth of Jesus Christ - Virgil was in later antiquity imputed to have the magical abilities of a seer; the Sortes Vergilianae, the process of using Virgil's poetry as a tool of divination, is found in the time of Hadrian, and continued into the Middle Ages.  In a similar vein Macrobius in the Saturnalia credits the work of Virgil as the embodiment of human knowledge and experience, mirroring the Greek conception of Homer.: 1603 Virgil also found commentators in antiquity.  Servius, a commentator of the 4th century AD, based his work on the commentary of Donatus.  Servius's commentary provides us with a great deal of information about Virgil's life, sources, and references; however, many modern scholars find the variable quality of his work and the often simplistic interpretations frustrating. Mantua me genuit, Calabri rapuere, tenet nunc Parthenope.  Cecini pascua, rura, duces.  (\" The verse inscription at Virgil's tomb was supposedly composed by the poet himself:(\" Mantua gave me life, the Calabrians took it away, Naples holds me now; I sang of pastures, farms, and commanders\" [transl.  Bernard Knox ]) Even as the Western Roman Empire collapsed, literate men acknowledged that Virgil was a master poet - Saint Augustine, for example, confessing how he had wept at reading the death of Dido. The best-known surviving manuscripts of Virgil's works include manuscripts from late antiquity such as the Vergilius Augusteus, the Vergilius Vaticanus and the Vergilius Romanus. Gregory of Tours read Virgil, whom he quotes in several places, along with some other Latin poets, though he cautions that \"we ought not to relate their lying fables, lest we fall under sentence of eternal death\". In the Renaissance of the 12th century, Alexander Neckham placed the \"divine\" Aeneid on his standard arts curriculum, and Dido became the romantic heroine of the age. Monks like Maiolus of Cluny might repudiate what they called \"the luxurious eloquence of Virgil\", but they could not deny the power of his appeal. Dante presents Virgil as his guide through Hell and the greater part of Purgatory in the Divine Comedy. Dante also mentions Virgil in De vulgari eloquentia, as one of the four regulati poetae along with Ovid, Lucan and Statius (ii, vi, 7). In Purgatorio 21, the pilgrim and Virgil encounter the shade of Statius, the author of the Thebaid.  Statius claims that Virgil was his \"mama . . .  and nurse in writing poetry\", as well as wishing that he could have \"lived back there while Virgil was alive\". Virgil does not wish for Statius to know his true identity, and he turns to Dante with \"a look that silently said: 'Be Silent'\". However, Dante smiles \"like one who gives a hint\", at the irony of the situation. Statius misinterprets Dante's laughter for disdain, and Virgil comes forth to reveal himself.  Upon learning his identity, Statius moves to embrace Virgil as a fellow poet; but Virgil says, \"Brother, do not, for you are a shade, and a shade is what you see\", since Statius is a Christian who \"exceeds him in the order of grace\". In Purgatorio 22, Statius claims that not only was Virgil his poetic inspiration but also that \"through you [I became] a Christian\", Statius having read Virgil's words in Eclogue 4 as a prophecy of Christ: \"The age begins anew; justice / returns and the first human time, and a new / offspring comes down from Heaven. The Renaissance saw a number of authors inspired to write epic in Virgil's wake: Edmund Spenser called himself the English Virgil; Paradise Lost was influenced by the example of the Aeneid; and later artists influenced by Virgil include Berlioz and Hermann Broch. The legend of \"Virgil in his basket\" arose in the Middle Ages, and is often seen in art and mentioned in literature as part of the Power of Women literary topos, demonstrating the disruptive force of female attractiveness on men.  In this story Virgil became enamored of a beautiful woman, sometimes described as the emperor's daughter or mistress and called Lucretia.  She played him along and agreed to an assignation at her house, which he was to sneak into at night by climbing into a large basket let down from a window.  When he did so he was hoisted only halfway up the wall and then left trapped there into the next day, exposed to public ridicule.  The story paralleled that of Phyllis riding Aristotle.  Among other artists depicting the scene, Lucas van Leyden made a woodcut and later an engraving. In the Middle Ages, Virgil's reputation was such that it inspired legends associating him with magic and prophecy.  From at least the 3rd century, Christian thinkers interpreted Eclogue 4, which describes the birth of a boy ushering in a golden age, as a prediction of Jesus's birth.  In consequence, Virgil came to be seen on a similar level to the Hebrew prophets of the Bible as one who had heralded Christianity. Relatedly, The Jewish Encyclopedia argues that medieval legends about the golem may have been inspired by Virgilian legends about the poet's apocryphal power to bring inanimate objects to life. Possibly as early as the second century AD, Virgil's works were seen as having magical properties and were used for divination.  In what became known as the Sortes Vergilianae (\"Virgilian Lots\"), passages would be selected at random and interpreted to answer questions. In the 12th century, starting around Naples but eventually spreading widely throughout Europe, a tradition developed in which Virgil was regarded as a great magician.  Legends about Virgil and his magical powers remained popular for over two hundred years, arguably becoming as prominent as his writings themselves. Virgil's legacy in medieval Wales was such that the Welsh version of his name, Fferyllt or Pheryllt, became a generic term for magic-worker, and survives in the modern Welsh word for pharmacist, fferyllydd. The structure known as \"Virgil's tomb\" is found at the entrance of an ancient Roman tunnel (aka grotta vecchia) in Piedigrotta, a district 3 kilometres (1. 9 mi) from the centre of Naples, near the Mergellina harbor, on the road heading north along the coast to Pozzuoli.  While Virgil was already the object of literary admiration and veneration before his death, in the Middle Ages his name became associated with miraculous powers, and for a couple of centuries his tomb was the destination of pilgrimages and veneration. By the fourth or fifth century AD the original spelling Vergilius had been changed to Virgilius, and then the latter spelling spread to the modern European languages. This latter spelling persisted even though, as early as the 15th century, the classical scholar Poliziano had shown Vergilius to be the original spelling. Today, the anglicisations Vergil and Virgil are both considered acceptable. There is some speculation that the spelling Virgilius might have arisen due to a pun, since virg- carries an echo of the Latin word for 'wand' (uirga), Vergil being particularly associated with magic in the Middle Ages.  There is also a possibility that virg- is meant to evoke the Latin virgo ('virgin'); this would be a reference to the fourth Eclogue, which has a history of Christian, and specifically Messianic, interpretations.

Further reading  Collected works Biography Commentary Bibliographies", "article_2": "Summary Virgil was born of peasant stock, and his love of the Italian countryside and of the people who cultivated it colours all his poetry.  He was educated at Cremona , at Milan , and finally at Rome, acquiring a thorough knowledge of Greek and Roman authors, especially of the poets, and receiving a detailed training in rhetoric and philosophy.  It is known that one of his teachers was the Epicurean Siro, and the Epicurean philosophy is substantially reflected in his early poetry but gradually gives way to attitudes more akin to Stoicism .  Virgil was regarded by the Romans as their greatest poet, an estimation that subsequent generations have upheld.  His fame rests chiefly upon the Aeneid , which tells the story of Romes legendary founder and proclaims the Roman mission to civilize the world under divine guidance.  His reputation as a poet endures not only for the music and diction of his verse and for his skill in constructing an intricate work on the grand scale but also because he embodied in his poetry aspects of experience and behaviour of permanent significance.  Virgils life was devoted entirely to his poetry and to studies connected with it; his health was never robust , and he played no part in military or political life.  It is said that he spoke once in the lawcourts without distinction and that his shy and retiring nature caused him to give up any ideas he might have had of taking part in the world of affairs.  He never married, and the first half of his life was that of a scholar and near recluse.  But, as his poetry won him fame, he gradually won the friendship of many important men in the Roman world.  Gradually, also, he became a Roman as well as a provincial .  (The area in which he had spent his youth, the area around the Po River known as the province of Cisalpine Gaul , was not finally incorporated into Italy until 42 bce.  Thus Virgil came, as it were, to Rome from the outside.  The enthusiasm of a provincial for Rome is seen in the first eclogue , one of his earliest poems, in which the shepherd Tityrus tells of his recent visit to the capital and his amazement at its splendours. ) During Virgils youth, as the Roman Republic neared its end, the political and military situation in Italy was confused and often calamitous.  The civil war between Marius and Sulla had been succeeded by conflict between Pompey and Julius Caesar for supreme power.  When Virgil was 20, Caesar with his armies swooped south from Gaul, crossed the Rubicon, and began the series of civil wars that were not to end until Augustus victory at Actium in 31 bce.  Hatred and fear of civil war is powerfully expressed by both Virgil and his contemporary Horace .  The key to a proper understanding of the Augustan Age and its poets lies, indeed, in a proper understanding of the turmoil that had preceded the Augustan peace.  Literary career Some of Virgils earliest poetry may have survived in a collection of poems attributed to him and known as the Appendix Vergiliana, but it is unlikely that many of these are genuine.  His earliest certain work is the Eclogues, a collection of 10 pastoral poems composed between 42 and 37 bce.  Some of them are escapist, literary excursions to the idyllic pastoral world of Arcadia based on the Greek poet Theocritus (flourished c.  280 bce) but more unreal and stylized.  They convey in liquid song the idealized situations of an imaginary world in which shepherds sing in the sunshine of their simple joys and mute their sorrows (whether for unhappy love or untimely death) in a formalized pathos.  But some bring the pastoral mode into touch with the real world, either directly or by means of allegory, and thus gave a new direction to the genre.  The fifth eclogue, on the death of Daphnis, king of the shepherds, clearly has some relationship with the recent death of Julius Caesar; the 10th brings Gallus, a fellow poet who also held high office as a statesman, into the pastoral world; the first and ninth are lamentations over the expulsion of shepherds from their farms.  (It was widely believed in antiquity that these poems expressed allegorically Virgils own loss of his family farm when the veteran soldiers of Antony and Octavian--later the emperor Augustus--were resettled after the Battle of Philippi in 42 bce.  It was thought that he subsequently recovered his property through the intervention of his powerful friends.  However that may be, it is certain that the poems are based on Virgils own experience, whether in connection with his own farm or with those of his friends; and they express, with a poignant pathos that has come to be regarded as specially Virgilian, the sorrow of the dispossessed. ) But one eclogue in particular stands out as having relevance to the contemporary situation, and this is the fourth (sometimes called the Messianic, because it was later regarded as prophetic of Christianity).  It is an elevated poem, prophesying in sonorous and mystic terms the birth of a child who will bring back the Golden Age, banish sin, and restore peace.  It was clearly written at a time when the clouds of civil war seemed to be lifting; it can be dated firmly to 41-40 bce, and it seems most likely that Virgil refers to an expected child of the triumvir Antony and his wife Octavia, sister of Octavian.  But, though a specific occasion may be allocated to the poem, it goes beyond the particular and, in symbolic terms, presents a vision of world harmony, which was, to some extent, destined to be realized under Augustus.  One of the most disastrous effects of the civil wars--and one of which Virgil, as a countryman, would be most intensely aware--was the depopulation of rural Italy.  The farmers had been obliged to go to the war, and their farms fell into neglect and ruin as a result.  The Georgics, composed between 37 and 30 bce (the final period of the civil wars), is a superb plea for the restoration of the traditional agricultural life of Italy.  In form it is didactic, but, as Seneca later said, it was written \"not to instruct farmers but to delight readers. \" The practical instruction (about plowing, growing trees, tending cattle, and keeping bees) is presented with vivid insight into nature, and it is interspersed with highly wrought poetical digressions on such topics as the beauty of the Italian countryside (Book II.  line 136 ff. ) and the joy of the farmer when all is gathered in (II. 458 ff. ).  The Georgics is dedicated (at the beginning of each book) to Maecenas, one of the chief of Augustus ministers, who was also the leading patron of the arts.  By this time Virgil was a member of what might be called the court circle, and his desire to see his beloved Italy restored to its former glories coincided with the national requirement of resettling the land and diminishing the pressure on the cities.  It would be wrong to think of Virgil as writing political propaganda; but equally it would be wrong to regard his poetry as unconnected with the major currents of political and social needs of the time.  Virgil was personally committed to the same ideals as the government.  In the year 31 bce, when Virgil was 38, Augustus (still known as Octavian) won the final battle of the civil wars at Actium against the forces of Antony and Cleopatra and from that time dates the Augustan Age.  Virgil, like many of his contemporaries, felt a great sense of relief that the senseless civil strife was at last over and was deeply grateful to the man who had made it possible.  Augustus was anxious to preserve the traditions of the republic and its constitutional forms, but he was in fact sole ruler of the Roman world.  He used his power to establish a period of peace and stability and endeavoured to reawaken in the Romans a sense of national pride and a new enthusiasm for their ancestral religion and their traditional moral values, those of bravery, parsimony, duty, responsibility, and family devotion.  Virgil, too, as a countryman at heart, felt a deep attachment to the simple virtues and religious traditions of the Italian people.  All his life he had been preparing himself to write an epic poem (regarded then as the highest form of poetic achievement), and he now set out to embody his ideal Rome in the Aeneid, the story of the foundation of the first settlement in Italy, from which Rome was to spring, by an exiled Trojan prince after the destruction of Troy by the Greeks in the 12th century bce.  The theme he chose gave him two great advantages: one was that its date and subject were very close to those of Homers Iliad and Odyssey, so that he could remodel episodes and characters from his great Greek predecessor; and the other was that it could be brought into relationship with his contemporary Augustan world by presenting Aeneas as the prototype of the Roman way of life (the last of the Trojans and the first of the Romans).  Moreover, by the use of prophecies and visions and devices such as the description of the pictures on Aeneas shield or of the origins of contemporary customs and institutions, it could foreshadow the real events of Roman history.  The poem, then, operates on a double time scale; it is heroic and yet Augustan.  The enthusiasm that Virgil felt for the reborn Rome promised by Augustus regime is often reflected in the poem.  The sonorous and awe-inspiring prophecy by Jupiter (I. 257 ff. ), giving a picture of Romes divinely inspired destiny, has a moving patriotic impact: \"To these I set no bounds in space or time--I have given them rule without end\" (278-279); and again, under Augustus, \"Then shall the harsh generations be softened, and wars shall be laid aside\" (291).  The speech ends with a memorable image depicting the personified figure of Frenzy in chains, gnashing its bloodstained teeth in vain.  At the end of the sixth book, Aeneas visits the underworld, and there pass before his eyes the figures of heroes from Roman history, waiting to be born.  The ghost of his father (Anchises) describes them to him and ends by defining the Roman mission as one concerned with government and civilization (compared with the Greek achievement in art and literature and theoretical science).  \"Rule the people with your sway, spare the conquered, and war down the proud\": this is the vision of Romes destiny that the emperor Augustus and the poet Virgil had before them--that Rome was divinely appointed first to conquer the world in war and then to spread civilization and the rule of law among the peoples.  As Horace told the Romans in one of his odes, \"Because you are servants of the gods, you are masters on earth. \" The vision of Rome that the Aeneid expresses is a noble one, but the real greatness of the poem is due to Virgils awareness of the private, as well as the public, aspects of human life.  The Aeneid is no panegyric; it sets the achievements and aspirations of the giant organization of Roman governmental rule in tension with the frustrated hopes and sufferings of individuals.  The most memorable figure in the poem--and, it has been said, the only character to be created by a Roman poet that has passed into world literature--is Dido, queen of Carthage, opponent of the Roman way of life.  In a mere panegyric of Rome, she could have been presented in such a way that Aeneas rejection of her would have been a victory to applaud; but, in fact, in the fourth book she wins so much sympathy that the reader wonders whether Rome should be bought at this price.  Again, Turnus, who opposes Aeneas when he lands in Italy, resists the invader who has come to steal his bride.  It is clear that Turnus is a less civilized character than Aeneas--but in his defeat Virgil allows him to win much sympathy.  These are two examples of the tension against Roman optimism; in many other ways, too, Virgil throughout the poem explores the problems of suffering and the pathos of the human situation.  Yet in the end, Aeneas endures and continues to his goal; his devotion to duty (pietas) prevails, and the Roman reader would feel that this should be.  \"So great a task it was to found the Roman nation\" (I. 33).  The Aeneid occupied Virgil for 11 years and, at his death, had not yet received its final revision.  In 19 bce, planning to spend a further three years on his poem, he set out for Greece--doubtless to obtain local colour for the revision of those parts of the Aeneid set in Greek waters.  On the voyage he caught a fever and returned to Italy but died soon after arrival at Brundisium.  Whether the Aeneid would have undergone major changes cannot be guessed; the story goes that Virgils dying wish was for his poem to be burned, but that this request was countermanded by the order of Augustus.  As it stands, the poem is a major monument both to the national achievements and ideals of the Augustan Age of Rome and to the sensitive and lonely voice of the poet who knew the \"tears in things\" as well as the glory.

Her literary work, mostly autobiographical, maintains close links with sociology. Ernaux was awarded the 2022 Nobel Prize in Literature \"for the courage and clinical acuity with which she uncovers the roots, estrangements and collective restraints of personal memory\". Ernaux was born in Lillebonne in Normandy and grew up in nearby Yvetot, where her parents ran a cafe-cum-grocery store in a working-class part of town. In 1960 she travelled to London where she worked as an au pair, an experience she would later relate in 2016's Memoire de fille (A Girl's Story). Upon returning to France, she studied at the universities of Rouen and then Bordeaux, qualified as a school-teacher, and earned a higher degree in modern literature in 1971.  She worked for a time on a thesis project, unfinished, on Pierre de Marivaux. In the early 1970s, Ernaux taught at the Bonneville Lycee, at the college of Evire in Annecy-le-Vieux, then in Pontoise, before joining the National Centre for Distance Education (Centre national d'enseignement a distance - CNED) where she was employed for 23 years. Annie Ernaux started her literary career in 1974 with Les Armoires vides (Cleaned Out), an autobiographical novel.  In 1984, she won the Renaudot Prize for another of her works La Place (A Man's Place), an autobiographical narrative focusing on her relationship with her father and her experiences growing up in a small town in France, and her subsequent process of moving into adulthood and away from her parents' place of origin. Early in her career, she turned from fiction to focus on autobiography. Her work combines historic and individual experiences.  She charts her parents' social progression (La place, La honte), her teenage years (Ce qu'ils disent ou rien), her marriage (La femme gelee), her passionate affair with an Eastern European man (Passion simple), her abortion (L'evenement), Alzheimer's disease (Je ne suis pas sortie de ma nuit), the death of her mother (Une femme), and breast cancer (L'usage de la photo). Ernaux also wrote L'ecriture comme un couteau (Writing as Sharp as a Knife) with Frederic-Yves Jeannet. A Woman's Story, A Man's Place, and Simple Passion were recognized as The New York Times Notable Books, and A Woman's Story was a finalist for the Los Angeles Times Book Prize. Shame was named a Publishers Weekly Best Book of 1998, I Remain in Darkness a Top Memoir of 1999 by The Washington Post, and The Possession was listed as a Top Ten Book of 2008 by More magazine. Her 2008 historical memoir Les Annees (The Years), well-received by French critics, is considered by many to be her magnum opus. In this book, Ernaux writes about herself in the third person ('elle', or 'she' in English) for the first time, providing a vivid look at French society just after the Second World War until the early 2000s. It is the story of a woman and of the evolving society she lived in.  The Years won the 2008 Prix Francois-Mauriac de la region Aquitaine , the 2008 Marguerite Duras Prize, the 2008 Prix de la langue francaise, the 2009 Telegramme Readers Prize, and the 2016 Strega European Prize.  Translated by Alison L.  Strayer, The Years was a finalist for the 31st Annual French-American Foundation Translation Prize, was nominated for the International Booker Prize in 2019, and won the 2019 Warwick Prize for Women in Translation. In 2018, she won the Premio Hemingway for her literary output as a whole. Her popularity in anglophone countries increased sharply after The Years was shortlisted for the International Booker Prize in 2019. The film Happening, based on the novel Happening (L'Evenement) by Ernaux and directed by Audrey Diwan, was released in 2021.  It received the Golden Lion at the 2021 Venice Film Festival. On 6 October 2022, it was announced that she was to be awarded the 2022 Nobel Prize in Literature \"for the courage and clinical acuity with which she uncovers the roots, estrangements and collective restraints of personal memory\". Ernaux is the 16th French writer, and the first Frenchwoman, to receive the literature prize. In congratulating her, President of France Emmanuel Macron said that she was the voice \"of the freedom of women and of the forgotten\". Many of her works have been translated into English and published by Seven Stories Press.  Ernaux is one of the seven founding authors from whom the Press takes its name. She was previously married to Philippe Ernaux, with whom she has two sons. The couple divorced in the early 1980s. She has been a resident of Cergy-Pontoise, a new town in the Paris suburbs, since the mid-1970s. The Prix Annie-Ernaux , of which she is the \"godmother\", bears her name.", "article_1": "The Nobel prize in literature has been awarded to Annie Ernaux \"for the courage and clinical acuity with which she uncovers the roots, estrangements and collective restraints of personal memory\".  Ernaux, who writes novels about daily life in France as well as non-fiction and is one of her countrys most acclaimed authors, had been among the favourites to win the prize.  The Nobel said that they had not yet been able to reach her on the phone, but expected to be able to speak to her soon.  Ernaux is the first French writer to win the Nobel since Patrick Modiano in 2014.  She becomes the 16th French writer to have won the Nobel to date.  Anders Olsson, chair of the Nobel committee, said that in her work, \"Ernaux consistently and from different angles, examines a life marked by strong disparities regarding gender, language and class\".  Ernaux was born in 1940 and grew up in the small town of Yvetot in Normandy.  She studied at Rouen University, and later taught at secondary school.  From 1977 to 2000, she was a professor at the Centre National dEnseignement par Correspondance.  Olsson said her \"path to authorship was long and arduous\".  Her debut was Les armoires vides, published in 1974 in France and as Cleaned Out in English in 1990.  It was her fourth book, La place or A Mans Place, that was her literary breakthrough.  A Mans Place and A Womans Story, which was originally published in 1988 in French, have become contemporary classics in France.  Ernaux won the Prix Renaudot in France in 2008 for her autobiography The Years, which was shortlisted for the Man Booker International prize in 2019 when it was translated into English by Alison L Strayer.  Ankita Chakraborty in the Guardian said Ernauxs Getting Lost, a book recording her obsessive affair with a Russian diplomat, would \"become a kind of totem for lovers: a manual to help them find their centre when, like Ernaux, they are lost in love\".  Chakraborty wrote: \"The quality that distinguishes Ernauxs writing on sex from others in her milieu is the total absence of shame.  Desire in her brings forth more desire, the impulse of death, happiness, and even past trauma, like her abortion, but never humiliation.  Reading her is to thoroughly purge yourself of the notion that shame could be a possible outcome of wanting sex. \" Olson said Ernaux \"manifestly believes in the liberating force of writing\".  01:15 2022 Nobel prize winner Annie Ernaux: 'I feel I have a new responsibility' - video \"Her work is uncompromising and written in plain language, scraped clean,\" he continued.  \"And when she with great courage and clinical acuity reveals the agony of the experience of class, describing shame, humiliation, jealousy or inability to see who you are, she has achieved something admirable and enduring. \" Ernauxs work was first published in English by Seven Stories Press in the US, which was founded in 1995 by Dan Simon.  The press is named for the seven authors Simon first published at Seven Stories Press; among them was Ernaux.  In the UK, independent publisher Fitzcarraldo Editions has published eight of Ernauxs books, with another two on the way.  Shame will be released next year, as will Ernauxs latest book Le jeune homme.  Publisher Jacques Testard described Ernaux as a very important feminist writer, and said The Years, the first book of hers he read, was \"an absolutely phenomenal book, undoubtedly a masterpiece\".  With The Years, Testard said Ernaux \"invents a form, does something genuinely new with literature; its an intersection of the novel and autobiography and non-fiction\".  Testard said Ernauxs \"literary project has been to write about her life and to get at the truth of it somehow . . .  I think shes written about every important event in her life, from becoming aware of what social classes are as a child, to the death of her father and the death of her mother, to the illegal abortion she had in France in the 1960s, to her first sexual experiences and then to writing about love and passion and desire,\" he said.  \"Shes been doing this for 50 years and there is a very genuine clarity to her work. \" With her interest in memory and in writing a life, said Testard, \"Proust is quite an obvious antecedent\" for Ernaux.  She is also influenced by Simone de Beauvoir, although the two women have very different social backgrounds.  Ernaux came from a working-class community, like French sociologist, public intellectual and writer Pierre Bourdieu, said Testard.  The Nobel prize in literature is worth 10m Swedish krona (PS840,000), and goes to the writer deemed to be, in the words of Alfred Nobels will, \"the person who shall have produced in the field of literature the most outstanding work in an ideal direction\".  Last year the prize was awarded to Abdulrazaq Gurnah, for \"uncompromising and compassionate penetration of the effects of colonialism and the fate of the refugee in the gulf between cultures and continents\".  Previous winners include Bob Dylan, cited for \"having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition\", and Kazuo Ishiguro \"who, in novels of great emotional force, has uncovered the abyss beneath our illusory sense of connection with the world\".

The 82-year-old writer is known for works that blur the line between memoir and fiction.  In making the announcement, the committee noted the \"clinical acuity with which she uncovers the roots, estrangements and collective restraints of personal memory. \" The permanent secretary also noted during his announcement that they had not been able to reach Ernaux to let her know of the award, worth approximately $900,000 in U. S.  dollars.  Ernaux was born in 1940 in France.  Her first book, Cleaned Out, in 1974, was an autobiographical novel about obtaining an abortion when it was still illegal in France.  She wrote the book in secret.  \"My husband had made fun of me after my first manuscript,\" she told the New York Times in 2020.  \"I pretended to work on a Ph. D.  thesis to have time alone. \" The book was translated into English in 1990.  At the press conference for the announcement, Anders Olsson, the chair of the Nobel committee for literature, was asked if there was a political sentiment behind giving the award to someone who has written so personally about abortion.  Olsson rebuffed, saying the committee focuses on literature and literary quality.  That said, \"it's very important for us also, that the laureate has universal consequence in her work.  That it can reach everyone. \" After decades of excavating her own past in various works, Ernaux published The Years, which many critics saw as the her defining statement.  First published in 2008, The Years was an expansive look at the society that created her.  While it was an examination of each year of her life from 1940 - 2006, Ernaux avoided any use of the pronoun \"I\" in favor of a broader \"we,\" or sometimes \"she. \" In reviewing the 2018 English translation of The Years for the LA Review of Books, writer Azarin Sadegh compared reading it to digging through old family photos.  \"For the reader, the images of the past reveal themselves in broken shapes and forms with holes all over,\" Sadegh writes.  \"You leaf through this pile of images and texts and feel immersed in the past.  The years have come and gone, and most of the moments lived -- captured only in photos and partially in memory-- have vanished. \" In 2020, her book A Girl's Story was translated into English.  It recalled her early teenage sexual experiences and excavated the shame of it all just ahead of the sexual revolution.  Erneaux has another book being translated into English, due in 2023, titled Look at the Lights, My Love.  According to the book's press release, it's a \"meditation on the phenomenon of the big-box super store. \" Of course, through the lens of Ernaux's own memory. ", "article_3": "A young woman has her first sexual experience.  She is pleased to be desired by someone.  She does not feel humiliated.  But, later, she is mocked, tormented by others who believe that she has debased herself.  Those whom she thought of as her friends now treat her like nothing.  She feels shame.  Is the shame hers? Or is it a reflection of what is expected of her? \"To go all the way to the end of 58 means agreeing to the demolition of all the interpretations Ive assembled over the years,\" Annie Ernaux writes in \"A Girls Story\" (Seven Stories), published in French in 2016, and now in English, translated by Alison L.  Strayer.  The book is an account of a sexual encounter Ernaux had as a teen-ager, and it is both a reconstruction of events and a deconstruction of feelings.  The emotional history, she hopes, will be the most personal one, the truest one.  The challenge of being a historian, however, is knowing whether what she felt--and what she still feels--really comes from within.  The book circles around the summer of 1958, when eighteen-year-old Annie is working as a camp counsellor in northern France, in a town she calls \"S. \" She is sheltered and naive; aside from a trip to Lourdes with her father, she has barely left home.  At camp, she develops a crush on a man she calls H.  He looks like Marlon Brando: \"She does not care that the other female counselors murmur to each other that hes all brawn, no brains. \" She thinks of him as \"the Archangel. \" What draws her to H is a need to be seen.  No one has ever looked at her with such a \"heavy gaze. \" They dance at a counsellors party.  \"Seduction\" is not the right word for what happens next.  But Ernaux doesnt give these events a single name.  Instead, she describes, as clearly as she can, how she follows H to her room, how \"she feels his sex prod at her belly through her jeans.  .  .  .  There is no difference between what she does and what happens to her. \" Soon, \"a thick jet of sperm explodes in her face, gushing all the way into her nostrils. \" The precision of this language doesnt necessarily evoke pleasure, but Annie is consumed by emotion, desperate for H and the possibility of his desire.  Ernaux is an unusual memoirist: she distrusts her memory.  She writes in the first person, and then abruptly switches and speaks about herself from a distance, calling past selves \"the girl of 58\" or \"the girl of S. \" At times, it seems as though she were looking at herself in an old photograph or a scene in a movie.  She tells us when she is getting lost in the story, and where her memory goes blank.  Ernaux does not so much reveal the past--she does not pretend to have any authoritative access to it--as unpack it.  \"What is the point of writing,\" she says, \"if not to unearth things?\" In this attempt at unearthing, her prose combines the spare and the unsparing.  She seems desperate to put it all on the page: period blood, abortions, contraceptive pills, dirty underwear, erections, and semen.  But Ernauxs writing is rubbed down, simple, almost clinical in its exactness.  From the vantage of adulthood, she Googles and questions, she revisits old haunts and reads old letters, as if she were a detective cracking an unsolvable case: the mystery of her own past.  But none of this investigating is done, one senses, with the expectation of ever truly settling on a truth.  \"I am not trying to remember,\" she writes.  \"I am trying to be inside.  .  .  .  To be there at that very instant, without spilling over into the before or after.  To be in the pure immanence of a moment. \" Of course, our recollections arent continuous, and you cant always get \"inside,\" no matter how many angles you try.  The difficulty of interiority is perhaps one reason that Ernaux, both as a girl and as an adult, cant help but turn to those around her for cues.  As readers, we lose access to \"the girl of S,\" often at the moments when we need it most.  Instead, Ernaux begins to discuss the reactions of the other counsellors: I will have to present another list that includes the coarse taunts, the hooting and jeering, the insults passed off as jokes, whereby the male counselors made her an object of scorn and derision, they whose verbal hegemony went unquestioned and was even admired by the female counselors.  Reading this book in 2020, one is tempted to think of these gaps and tricks of memory in terms of trauma--the kind of trauma that keeps women from giving, or getting, a full account of their own lives.  Completion, were told, is a necessary condition for truth.  \"Dont tell us the story of your life, its full of holes,\" the other counsellors like to say.  Her peers dig up her letters and read them out loud to one another.  They drag her to Hs door.  The teen-age Ernaux does not realize what is happening.  It is only later that she perceives the effects of this \"verbal hegemony. \" When someone writes \"Long live whores\" on her mirror in toothpaste, these words begin to shape how she sees herself.  And it isnt so easy to look away from the mirrors that society creates for us.  When Ernaux leaves the camp, she develops bulimia, and her period stops.  \"I could not imagine there was a name for my behavior.  .  .  .  I thought of it as a moral failing.  I dont believe I linked it to H. \" These links are what Ernaux, as a writer, has always been after.  In the sixty years and twenty books since the summer of 1958, she has been devoted to a single task: the excavation of her own life.  \"I would go so far as to judge my previous books as vague approximations\" of reality, Ernaux writes in \"A Girls Story. \" In one, she describes a love affair; in another, the relationship between her parents.  Throughout, the contours of her story stay the same--a childhood in Normandy as the daughter of two grocers, the shame of her lower-class upbringing, the clash of these origins with her later literary successes.  Her mother \"knew all the household tips that lessened the strain of poverty.  This knowledge .  .  .  stops at my generation.  I am only the archivist,\" she writes in her 1988 book, \"A Womans Story. \" Ernauxs books are small, simple, rarely exceeding a hundred pages.  In each, she is always asking how she can be sure that her memories are correct.  In \"A Womans Story,\" she talks about her mothers death.  Nearly a decade later, in \"I Remain in Darkness\" (1997), she goes back to that moment and declares her recollection incomplete--she hadnt fully described her mothers long cognitive decline, the terrors of dementia.  A consistent voice guides each of these revisitations: a scientific and searching \"I. \" The books are whittled down to an intense core--not a confession but a kind of personal epistemology.  In France, they have brought Ernaux fame, prizes, and a number of stylistic descendants.  Central to her work is an awareness that the most intimate moments of life are always governed by the circumstances in which they occur--that probing the personal will also involve investigating the historical.  This is clearest in \"Happening\" (2000), an account of an abortion Ernaux had in 1963.  Early in the book, she describes going to see an acquaintance who is known as an activist for greater access to birth control.  He tries to sleep with her.  Then he tells her that he cant help her.  After she has travelled to Paris to obtain the abortion, she hears that \"a woman who lived round the corner would do it for three hundred francs.  .  .  .  Now that I no longer needed them, suddenly, bevies of abortionists were springing up left, right, and center. \" By the time Ernaux published the book, abortion had been legalized.  But a victory in legislation does not make disclosure any easier.  \"When a new law abolishing discrimination is passed, former victims tend to remain silent on the grounds that 'now its all over, \" she writes.  \"So what went on is surrounded by the same veil of secrecy as before. \" In typical Ernaux fashion, she reads over her old diary to compare what she still remembers with what she experienced at the time:", "article_4": "PARIS (AP) -- French author Annie Ernaux won this years Nobel Prize in literature Thursday for blending fiction and autobiography in books that fearlessly mine her experiences as a working-class woman to explore life in France since the 1940s.  In more than 20 books published over five decades, Ernaux has probed deeply personal experiences and feelings - love, sex, abortion, shame - within a society split by gender and class divisions.  After a half-century of defending feminist ideals, Ernaux said \"it doesnt seem to me that women have become equal in freedom, in power,\" and she strongly defended womens rights to abortion and contraception.  \"I will fight to my last breath so that women can choose to be a mother, or not to be.  Its a fundamental right,\" she said at a news conference in Paris.  Ernauxs first book, \"Cleaned Out,\" was about her own illegal abortion before it was legalized in France.  ADVERTISEMENT The prize-giving Swedish Academy said Ernaux, 82, was recognized for \"the courage and clinical acuity\" of books rooted in her small-town background in the Normandy region of northwest France.  Anders Olsson, chairman of the Nobel literature committee, said Ernaux is \"not afraid to confront the hard truths. \" \"She writes about things that no one else writes about, for instance her abortion, her jealousy, her experiences as an abandoned lover and so forth.  I mean, really hard experiences,\" he told The Associated Press after the award announcement in Stockholm.  \"And she gives words for these experiences that are very simple and striking.  They are short books, but they are really moving. \" French President Emmanuel Macron tweeted: \"Annie Ernaux has been writing for 50 years the novel of the collective and intimate memory of our country.  Her voice is that of womens freedom, and the centurys forgotten ones. \" While Macron praised Ernaux for her Nobel, she has been unsparing with him.  A supporter of left-wing causes for social justice, she has poured scorn on Macrons background in banking and said his first term as president failed to advance the cause of French women.  Ernauxs books present uncompromising portraits of lifes most intimate moments, including sexual encounters, illness and the deaths of her parents.  Olsson said Ernauxs work was often \"written in plain language, scraped clean. \" He said she had used the term \"an ethnologist of herself\" rather than a writer of fiction.  ADVERTISEMENT Dan Simon, Ernauxs longtime American publisher at Seven Stories Press, said that in the early years, \"she insisted that we not categorize her books at all.  She did not allow us to refer to them as fiction and she did not allow us to refer to them as nonfiction. \" Ultimately, he said, Ernaux has created \"a genre of fiction in which nothing is made up. \" \"Shes a great storyteller of her own life,\" Simon said.  Ernaux worked as a teacher before becoming a full-time writer.  Her first book was \"Les armoires vides\" in 1974 (published in English as \"Cleaned Out\").  Two more autobiographical novels followed - \"Ce quils disent ou rien\" (\"What They Say Goes\") and \"La femme gelee\" (\"The Frozen Woman\") - before she moved to more overtly autobiographical books.  ADVERTISEMENT In the book that made her name, \"La place\" (\"A Mans Place\"), published in 1983 and about her relationship with her father, she wrote: \"No lyrical reminiscences, no triumphant displays of irony.  This neutral writing style comes to me naturally. \" \"La honte\" (\"Shame\"), published in 1997, explored a childhood trauma, while \"Levenement\" (\"Happening\"), from 2000, dealt like \"Cleaned Out\" with an illegal abortion.  Her most critically acclaimed book is \"Les annees\" (\"The Years\"), published in 2008.  Described by Olsson as \"the first collective autobiography,\" it depicted Ernaux herself and wider French society from the end of World War II to the 21st century.  Its English translation was a finalist for the International Booker Prize in 2019.  Ernauxs \"Memoire de fille\" (\"A Girls Story\"), from 2016, follows a young womans coming of age in the 1950s, while \"Passion Simple\" (\"Simple Passion\") and \"Se perdre\" (\"Getting Lost\") chart Ernauxs intense affair with a Russian diplomat.  ADVERTISEMENT Ernaux has described facing scorn from Frances literary establishment because she is a woman from a working-class background.  \"My work is political,\" she said at the news conference.  She described growing up in a milieu outside the elite, a world of \"people above you\" and the seeming impossibility of becoming a famous writer.  The literature prize has long faced criticism that it is too focused on European and North American writers, as well as too male-dominated.  Last years prize winner, Tanzanian-born, U. K. -based writer Abdulrazak Gurnah, was only the sixth Nobel literature laureate born in Africa.  More than a dozen French writers have captured the literature prize, though Ernaux is the first French woman to win, and just the 17th woman among the 119 Nobel literature laureates.  Olsson said the academy was working to diversify its range, drawing on experts in literature from different regions and languages.  ADVERTISEMENT \"We try to broaden the concept of literature but it is the quality that counts, ultimately,\" he said.  Ernaux said she wasnt sure what she would do with the Nobels cash award of 10 million Swedish kronor (nearly $900,000).  \"I have a problem with money,\" she told reporters.  \"Money is not a goal for me.  . . .  I dont know how to spend it well. \" A week of Nobel Prize announcements kicked off Monday with Swedish scientist Svante Paabo receiving the award in medicine for unlocking secrets of Neanderthal DNA that provided key insights into our immune system.  Frenchman Alain Aspect, American John F.  Clauser and Austrian Anton Zeilinger won the physics prize on Tuesday for work showing that tiny particles can retain a connection with each other even when separated, a phenomenon known as quantum entanglement.  The Nobel Prize in chemistry was awarded Wednesday to Americans Carolyn R.  Bertozzi and K.  Barry Sharpless, and Danish scientist Morten Meldal for developing a way of \"snapping molecules together\" that can be used to explore cells, map DNA and design drugs to target cancer and other diseases.  The 2022 Nobel Peace Prize will be announced on Friday and the economics award on Monday.  The prizes will be handed out on Dec.  10.  The prize money comes from a bequest left by the prizes creator, Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel, in 1895.  ___ Keyton reported from Stockholm and Lawless from London.

The main themes threaded through her work over more than four decades, are: the body and sexuality; intimate relationships; social inequality and the experience of changing class through education; time and memory; and the overarching question of how to write these life experiences.  In Ernauxs work the most personal, the most intimate experiences - whether of grieving, classed shame, nascent sexuality, passion, illegal abortion, illness, or the perception of time - are always understood as shared by others, and reflective of the social, political and cultural context in which they occur.  Having published three autobiographical novels (Cleaned Out, What they say goes and The Frozen Woman), Ernaux turned away from fiction with the publication of A Mans Place.  In this process she has invented narrative forms that constitute new directions in life writing: autosociobiographical texts, such as A Mans Place, A Womans Story and Shame explore her own life and that of her parents, but also the social milieu in which those lives evolved, while the collective autobiography, The Years, covers the social and cultural history of France since her birth in 1940 to 2007.  Ernaux has also published diary extracts ('I remain in Darkness, Getting Lost) and 'diaries of the outside, where she describes her encounters with others in public spaces such as supermarkets, trains and the Paris metro (Exteriors, Things Seen, 'Look at the Pretty Lights Darling/ 'Regarde les lumieres, mon amour*).  She focuses on the process of writing in her notes on work in progress ('The Dark Workshop/ LAtelier noir*), a dialogue with another writer ('Writing sharp as a knife/ LEcriture comme un couteau, with Frederic-Yves Jeannet*), and memoirs that link the description of intense personal experiences with reflections on writing (Simple Passion, Happening, The Possession, A Girls Story, 'The Young man/ Le Jeune homme*).  Two works, 'The Uses of Photography/ LUsage de la photo* and 'Writing Life/ Ecrire la vie* explore the relationship between writing and photographic representations of the past, while in 'The Other Daughter/ LAutre fille* Ernaux writes a letter to the sister who died before her birth.  Finally, Ernaux has published discussions of her relationship with the significant places of her life ('Where I belong/ Le Vrai lieu*; 'Return to Yvetot/ Retour a Yvetot*) (see the Places section of this site).  Ernauxs books are followed by a faithful readership, and are reviewed in most local and national newspapers in France, as well as being the subject of many radio and television interviews and programmes, and a large and growing international academic literature.  This site responds to this interest in her work and through its largely bilingual construction attempts to bring her work to the attention of the anglophone world.  We provide an extensive bibliography, a short biography, a selection of short texts and essays, some of them unpublished and available for the first time here in English, and news relating to Ernauxs writing and its reception.

She attended the American School of Barcelona, where she learned to speak fluent English, Spanish and Catalan. Baquero started acting professionally at the age of eight, playing a few small roles in a number of films, the most notable of which is Fragile, in which she played a minor role.  She was in a number of other films including Romasanta and Rottweiler.  She has also appeared on Spanish television on a few occasions. From about 1,000 young actresses, Baquero was picked to play the role of Ofelia in Pan's Labyrinth in 2006.

Born in Villefranche-de-Rouergue, Belle-Isle was the grandson of Nicolas Fouquet, who served as Superintendent of Finances under Louis XIV.  His family was in disgrace because of Fouquet's brash ambition in the eyes of Louis XIV.  Determined to blot out his family's prior disgrace, he entered the army at an early age and was made proprietary colonel of a dragoon regiment in 1708.  He rose during the War of the Spanish Succession to the rank of brigadier, and in March 1718 to that of Marechal de Camp. He was present at the capture of Fuenterrabia in 1718 and of San Sebastian in 1719 during the War of the Quadruple Alliance (1718-1720. ) Aided by the rise of Cardinal Fleury, Belle-Isle was made lieutenant-general, and grew in influence over French military policy. In the War of the Polish Succession he commanded a corps under the orders of Marshal Berwick, capturing Trier and Traben-Trarbach and taking part in the Siege of Philippsburg in 1734.  When peace was made in 1736, Louis XV gave Belle-Isle the governments of three important fortresses: Metz, Toul, and Verdun offices that he would hold until his death.  This was in recognition of both his military services and of his taking part in the negotiations for the cession of Lorraine. Belle-Isle's military and political reputation was now at its height, and he was one of the government's principal advisers on military and diplomatic affairs.  In 1741 he was sent on diplomatic mission to Frankfurt, Germany as French Plenipotentiary to carry out, in the interests of France, a grand scheme of political reorganization in the moribund empire, and especially to obtain the election of Charles Albert, Elector of Bavaria as emperor.  The long tradition of Franco-Austrian rivalry had crystallized around Belle-Isle, who had emerged as the leader of the bellicose bloc of French policy makers towards the House of Austria. In the eventful year of 1741, he was at the masthead of French interventionist policy in Germany--characterized by scholar Richard Lodge as a \"scheme for the humiliation of the House of Austria,\"--and of the beginnings of the War of the Austrian Succession.  French aggression was in large part made possible by the precedent set by the Frederick II of Prussia and his conquest of Silesia.  France's initial victories--including the election of Charles Albert to Holy Roman Emperor--were short lived, and by 1743 the war was proving to be very disappointing for France, as Belle-Isle's military command in Germany was full of setbacks and losses.  His aggressive strategy towards Austria was predicated on the swift defeat of an impotent and disorganized Austria, along with the lynchpin that was Franco-Prussian alliance. Belle-Isle was named Marechal de France in 1741 and received control of a large army, with which it is said that he promised to make peace in three months under the walls of Vienna.  The truth of this story is open to question, for no one knew better than Belle-Isle the limitations imposed upon commanders by the military and political circumstances of the times.  He was, according to one scholar, \"the most important single influence on French policy in the crucial year of 1741. \" However, the circumstances in which he found himself severely limited his efforts both as a general and as a statesman. Following his initial victories, Belle-Isle suffered regression and defeat.  This was at least partly because Frederick the Great, having already accomplished his aims, pulled Prussia out of the war prematurely, leaving Belle-Isle at the mercy of a much larger Austrian army.  Despite the desperate circumstances, however, the daring French retreat from Prague would distinguish Belle-Isle's military brilliance and bravery.  In ten days he led 14,000 men--5000 men stayed in the city under the command of Francois de Chevert--into and across the Upper Palatine Forest whilst being harassed by the enemy's light cavalry and suffering great hardships.  But by never allowing himself to be cut off, he was able to reach the relative safety of Eger, after losing 1500 men. His subordinate, Francois de Chevert, and his 5000 men, defended Prague so well that the Austrians allowed them to leave the city through an honourable capitulation.  The means by which this was obtained supposedly included Chevert threatening to burn down the city. The campaign, however, had discredited Belle-Isle; he was ridiculed in Paris and Fleury is said to have turned against him, and to complete his misfortunes, he was taken prisoner by the English in going from Cassel to Berlin through Hanover. He was forced to remain a year in England, in spite of the demands of Louis XV and the Emperor Charles VII.  During the French campaigns of 1746-47, Belle-Isle was in command at the Alpine frontier.  There his younger brother, the Chevalier de Belle-Isle, served under his command.  The younger Belle-Isle led the French army sent to invade Piedmont where he was killed at the Battle of Assietta.  Following the defeat, French forces were weakened and demoralized.  However, the older Belle-Isle still managed to repel a follow-up invasion of the Provence by Austrian and Italian forces and pushed the fighting back into the plain of Lombardy.  At the peace, having thus retrieved his military reputation from the disasters of 1742-43, Belle-Isle was made a Peer of France in 1748. King Louis XV would make him Secretary of State for War in 1758, a position Belle-Isle would hold until his death in 1761. During his three years as Secretary of War, Belle-Isle undertook many reforms.  Most Important was the development of a French military school for officers, seeing as the officer corps was shown to be inadequate during the wars of the past few decades. This included the suppression of the proprietary colonelcies of nobles who were too young to command; and he instituted an Order of Merit.  These reforms of the officer corps were similar to the structure of the Prussian army in that it attempted to place merit and honour above the blind appointments of nobility.  The successfulness of his reforms is debated, because by this time the Seven Years' War was in progress.  According to one scholar, Walter L.  Dorn, Belle-Isle's efforts came \"too late to make a difference\" in the war and the continuing decline of French military power. Belle-Isle was a close friend of Count Saint-Germain and in 1760 allowed him to travel to The Hague in order to secure a peace treaty, obtain funding for France, and set up a whole separate company to manage France's treasury.  The French Foreign Minister, Duc de Choiseul, was strongly against this and tried to have Count Saint-Germain arrested. Belle-Isle held an interest in literature throughout his life, and was elected a member of the French National Academy in 1740; so he founded the National Academy of Metz in 1760.  Also, Belle-Isle is regarded today as a builder-ruler.  As benefactor of the city, he initiated during his dukedom the modernization of the centre of Metz in a context of Enlightenment.  Belle-Isle awarded royal architect Jacques-Francois Blondel for the embellishment of the town square and the construction of the city hall, the parliament, and the guardhouse lodging.  He also decided the edification of the royal Governor and Intendant palaces and the opera house of Metz, describing it as \"one of the most beautiful France's opera-theater\" at his time.  Just before his death, he stated: \"The city of Metz is my mistress. \" However, his dukedom over Metz would end with his death because his only son, the Comte de Gisors, had been killed on 23 June 1758 in the Battle of Krefeld.  A commemorative plate honors him today on the forecourt of the opera house of Metz.", "article_1": "Charles Fouquet, duke de Belle-Isle, (born Sept.  24, 1684, Villefranche, Fr. --died Jan.  26, 1761, Versailles), marshal of France and statesman chiefly important for his role in involving France in the War of the Austrian Succession.  A grandson of the notorious Nicolas Fouquet, finance minister under Louis XIV, Belle-Isle joined the army as a youth and fought in the War of the Spanish Succession and in the war of 1718-19 against Spain.  He made his fortune by speculation in a financial system developed by John Law, Scottish monetary reformer and originator of the \"Mississippi Scheme. \" He was disgraced and exiled to his estates by the Duc de Bourbon, head of the regency council.  He recovered his position at court under Cardinal Fleury and enhanced his military reputation by successes in the Rhineland during the War of the Polish Succession.  Hoping to succeed Fleury as prime minister, Belle-Isle engaged in various court intrigues.  He led an anti-Austrian faction at court that forced Fleury into offensive operations against Maria Theresa in the interest of Charles Albert, elector of Bavaria.  France ended by repudiating Fleurys recognition of the Pragmatic Sanction and by forgoing a chance to concentrate on naval and colonial rivalry with Great Britain.  Belle-Isle was influential in securing the election of Charles Albert as emperor (Charles VII) on Jan.  24, 1742, for which he was created duc de Gisors in March.  Later, as military commander, he skillfully led the withdrawal of French forces from Prague (1742) and successfully defended Provence against the Austrians and Sardinians (1746-47).  In 1748 his duchy was made a peerage of France, and in 1749 he was elected to the Academie Francaise.  Belle-Isle served as minister of war (1758-60) during the Seven Years War; he carried out minor administrative reforms but was criticized for his failure to reinforce the French troops at Quebec, thereby losing Canada.
